Court remands 4 men for allegedly burning Obasanjo’s mango farm,"A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi on Friday ordered the remand of four men in a correctional centre for allegedly conspiring and burning a Mango farm belonging to former President Olusegun Obasanjo.



The suspects: Julius Igyo, Samuel Aleva, Pius Mcha and Daniel Ortserga, are all of Howe town in Gwer-East Local Government Area of Benue.



They were charged with criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation, criminal trespass, mischief by fire and act of terrorism.



The Chief Magistrate, Mr Vincent Kor, did not take the plea of the suspects for want of jurisdiction and adjourned the matter until March 28 for further mention.



Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Ato, told the court that on Jan. 31, the Manager of the farm, Mr Suberu Mohammed, reported the incident to the Commissioner of Police in Benue.



Ato said the manager said that on Jan. 29, he received a phone call from his assistant, Gowon Tarkev, that fire had engulfed the farm.



He stated further that when he rushed to the farm, he discovered that fire had burnt down 90 hectares of the farm comprising 18,360 mango trees valued at N183.6 million.

The manager in his statement accused the suspects, Asande Ishor, Uger Jarpes, Moses Torchie and many others from Howe of being responsible for the incident.



He also said that the suspects earlier demanded for compensation over the land where the mango trees were planted.



Mohammed said that the suspects and their accomplices had terrorised them in the farm by beating them, threatening their lives and cutting down the mango trees.



The prosecutor said the suspects were arrested during police investigation while others were still at large.



He said the offences contravened the provisions of sections 97, 398, 349 and 338 of the Penal Code, Laws of Benue, 2004.

Court voids suit seeking removal of Ekiti Varsity VC,"A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Friday, rejected a suit seeking to invalidate the appointment of Prof. Abayomi Fasina as the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE).

Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, ruled that the plaintiff, Tableland Society For the Oppressed (TSFO), lacked the legal right to institute the suit.

Justice Ekwo further held that plaintiff failed to establish that it was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to engage in public interest litigation and question the activities of government’s agencies.

The judge, who upheld the defendants’ preliminary objection, denied jurisdiction over the case.

He, thereafter, struck out the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/250/2021.

Listed as defendants in the suit are the Minister of Education; the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; the Chairman of FUOYE’s Governing Council; the institution’s Registrar; the Chairman, National University Commission and Prof. Fasina.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that TSFO had argued that Fasina was not qualified for the appointment having allegedly been indicted for wrong doing and having also not done well in the interview during the selection process.

It accused the university’s Governing Council of manipulating selection process to favour Fashina.

The plaintiff prayed the court to, among others, void Fasina’s appointment and order the conduct of fresh appointment process.

The group stated that “the 6th defendant (Fasina) was indicted by the committee set up by Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, for collecting double salary from both Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti and Federal University Oye-Ekiti.

“Section 42 of the Constitution has been violated by the appointment of the 6th defendant, who failed the selection interview organised.

“The defendants have all endorsed and unjustly conferred the position of the Vice Chancellor on the 6th defendant who is not qualified at the expense of qualified candidates purely on the basis of discrimination.

Fuel Scarcity: Adulterated fuel damages our vehicles – RTEAN,"Alhaji Olayinka Onikijipa, the Chairman of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) in Kwara, has said that the adulterated fuel in circulation has damaged some of their vehicles.

Onikijipa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Friday that the fuel scarcity had given some unpatriotic people the opportunity to exploit Nigerians.

“This is a very sad situation we have found ourselves; the adulterated fuel in circulation has damaged two of our vehicles.

“I think many more were damaged, but have not been reported officially to the association. This situation has brought back memories of bad governance in our nation.

“We spend the whole day at the fuel station, yet still buying adulterated fuel, it has affected our business negatively,” he said.

He, however, called on the government to be proactive and ensure that regulatory bodies were up to the task of protecting citizens and their interests.

The chairman said interstate transportation fare had not increased, but they may be forced to increase it, if the scarcity persisted.

“Transportation fare remains the same for now, but if scarcity persists, I do not know what can happen.

“Some bad people have capitalised on the situation to exploit Nigerians because people are complaining of buying fuel above the pump price where it is available.

“This is bad; we do not have to inconvenience ourselves. We should all have the love of this nation at heart.

“The government should be more proactive in their responsibilities to the citizens.

“And I want to advise those hoarding fuel in their vehicles, home and shops to stop the practice; it can wreak havoc at any time.

Battle over APC convention: PMP Presidential candidate pushes hard to clinch APC secretary,"…Senator Osita Izunaso struggles

…Uzodimma silence causes confusion – Stakeholders

By Chinonso Alozie

The 2011 presidential candidate of the Peoples Mandate Party, PMP, Batos Nwadike, and Special Adviser on political affairs to Imo governor, Hope Uzodimma, has not relented in his move to grab the position of the National Secretary of the APC, ahead of the APC National convention on 26 February 2022.

Vanguard gathered that Nwadike has set up his campaign team, which happened on Friday in Abuja.

But Nwadike has remained silent on whether he has the full backing of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma, in this political journey.

In another move, Senator Osita Izunaso has been making such a move to becoming the next National Secretary of APC.

But the two camps of Nwadike, and Senator Izunaso, have been in a long race to edge each other out of the contest as well as get the endorsement

of the key players at the convention.

Vanguard gathered from some of the APC, stakeholders, who pleaded not to mention their names said: “The silence of the governor can confuse the party. He should be able to call his children together so that they will not go to the convention with divided minds.

“Maybe the governor will do that at the last minute. That is what he’s waiting for. We think that his intervention will reduce the level of acrimony and spending of resources by those aspiring to that position from the Imo APC, chapter.

“Another thing is that has the APC, agreed to zone the position to the South East? Let us not go and waste our resources in this battle. Let us be careful.

“Another thing worrisome with the way the convention arrangement is going on will the convention still hold on that 26 February, that is another issue. But let us keep watching.”","But Nwadike has remained silent on whether he has the full backing of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma, in this political journey.

Amotekun: Arewa youths caution Ondo Governor over alleged harassment of northerners,"The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYCF) on Friday, cautioned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to end the constant harassment of northerners in the state by the Amotekun security outfit.

A statement signed by the Forum’s National President, Yerima Shettima alleged that on many occasions, Amotekun corps personnel have picked up and harassed northerners in the state for just no cause.

The statement said the existence of SSS, the Army, Amotekun, NSCDC and other security personnel is to protect lives and properties and not to harass residents

It added that the Amotekun Corps which is state-owned should not be used arbitrarily against the few northerners in the state, who are just going about their legitimate businesses.

The statement informed the governor that, as northerners are in the state for their legitimate businesses, so also, there are westerners spread across the northern parts of the country.

Shettima added that, if the same unnecessary maltreatment, hatred and harassment is meted out to them, there will be no peace in the country.

It warned that, if the government of Ondo State allows such intimidation and harassment to continue, without justification, it would mean that he does not want northerners in his state.","The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYCF) on Friday, cautioned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to end the constant harassment of northerners in the state by the Amotekun security outfit.

NULGE alerts Soludo of alleged subletting of Anambra’s revenue windows to politicians,"Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has raised alarm over the alleged sublet of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo had recently threatened to revoke all revenue windows allocated to politicians, through an executive order on the morning of his swearing-in.

NULGE on Friday claimed it has information that the state revenue board was allocating revenue windows to their cronies, with the intent to hijack the state’s resources, especially as the Governor Willie Obiano administration winds down.

The state president of the group, Mr Chikwelu Adigwe who briefed members of the union at the state secretariat of the union in Awka said most of the revenue windows being sold out belong to the local government areas.

The president also protested the highjacking of most revenues being collected by the local government councils, thereby rendering them useless.

“The condition of our service is no longer acceptable to us, so we want to make our voices heard.

“We are doing all we can during this transition period to ensure that the right things are done. We have written to the transition committee, we have also written to the assembly to complain about the continuous confirmation of transition committee chairmen, instead of holding local government elections.

“Right now, we have it on good authority that the state revenue board is still allocating revenue windows to politicians, and we want to warn the governor-elect about this.

“We are here today to complain about the way the system is running. The system was not like this when we came into the service. Things have gone so bad.

“When we were in school, we heard that there were three tiers of government, but gradually, the local government has been rendered redundant and inexistent. Our job is gradually being taken away by the state, but we will not allow this to continue.”

The union said it has resolved to take back all revenue windows belonging to it, including stallage fees, wheelbarrow levies, liquor licenses and many others, which have been taken from them by the state government.

The union also urged Soludo to ensure the conduct of local government elections within three months of his swearing-in, ensure the reconstitution of the Local Government Service Commission to include local government workers, instead of an all-politicians affairs, among others.

“We have charged our members to go out and collect revenues due to their various local government councils. Any shop owner who pays revenue touts should be ready to pay twice. We are not preaching war here, but we will not run away from war,” Adigwe said.","Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has raised alarm over the alleged sublet of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Abuja court strikes out suit seeking Federal University Vice Chancellor’s sack,"A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday struck out a suit seeking to void the appointment of Professor Abayomi Sunday Fasina as the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) in Ekiti state.

Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo, in a judgment, held that the plaintiff – Tableland Society For the Oppressed (TSFO) – lacked the locus standi to institute the suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/250/2021.

Justice Ekwo further held that the plaintiff failed to establish that it was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to engage in public interest litigation and question the activities of government’s agencies.

The judge, who upheld the defendants’ preliminary objection, denied jurisdiction over the case and proceeded to strike it out.

Listed as defendants in the suit are the Minister of Education, the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; the Chairman of FUOYE’s Governing Council; the institution’s Registrar; the Chairman, National University Commission and Prof. Fasina.

TSFO had argued among others that Fasina was not qualified for the appointment having allegedly been indicted for wrongdoing and having also not done well in the interview during the selection process.

It accused the university’s Governing Council of manipulating the selection process to favour Fashina.

Gunmen attack Okomu Oil Palm Company to avenge arrest of two suspects – Olise,"From Tony Osauzo, Benin

Gunmen on Thursday, reportedly attacked Okomu Oil Palm Company in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State, barely a day after two suspects were paraded by the State Police Command over their involvement in a February 1 attack in which two staff killed and 90 hectares of the Company’s rubber estate and three excavators were burnt.

The Company’s Communication officer, Fidelis Olise, who disclosed this yesterday, said the gunmen had earlier carried out attack on Tuesday, making it two attacks in the three days.

Describing the gunmen as terrorists, Olise said they carried out the latest attacks in retaliation of the arrest of two of their supposed members.

“The same terrorists, seemingly angered by the arrest of two of their supposed members carried out further attacks on innocent workers on the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s property to avenge the arrest of their accomplices who apparently confessed to the theft of rubber. They were arrested by the Marine Police on a boat after it had left the Okomu Ijaw Community on its way to Delta State.

“The killing of innocent workers who are performing their legitimate duties and have no conflict or disagreement with any person is strongly condemned and the powers that be should immediately take action against those terrorists responsible for these murderous crimes.

“Attacks on companies like Okomu, are also a serious note for concern as it seems that terrorists are now focusing on these types of establishments, intent on bringing them to their knees, and in so doing creating an environment that could show the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led Government as weak. It also poses a great threat to current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria as a whole, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the Buhari administrations.

“The time has come for the Buhari and Obaseki administrations to take concerted and decisive actions against these terrorists, otherwise investment in the agricultural sector will be greatly discouraged just as was the case with pipeline vandalization in the past, with the resultant negative effect on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both state and federal government coffers.

“The Police must immediately undertake a thorough investigation and bring all those linked to the heinous attacks to book, thereby showing that they are a force to be reckoned with, and reinstating confidence in their ability to fight crime. The army too should be deployed to ensure that this area of Ovia South West Local Government Area is safe for all, while terrorists and cultists are rooted from this area for good”, the Okomu Oil Palm Company further stated.","The Company’s Communication officer, Fidelis Olise, who disclosed this yesterday, said the gunmen had earlier carried out attack on Tuesday, making it two attacks in the three days.

"Transport fare skyrockets, commuters stranded as fuel queues persist","From Uche Usim, Abuja

The price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol hit N700 per litre in Abuja, yesterday, even as residents have described the protracted scarcity as a worse-than-hell-experience.

From Kubwa to Wuse, Maitama to Asokoro, most of the filling stations had ran out of fuel while the few that sold had long queues. At bus stops, scores of commuters were stranded as fewer commercial vehicles plied the roads.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The scarcity also forced Bolt and Uber hailing cabs to cancel their booking even as transport fares rose significantly due to demand outpacing supply. Cost of transport from Kubwa to Wuse jumped from N200 to N350.

A taxi driver, David Adams, told Daily Sun that most filling stations preferred to sell between midnight and 4am to enable them sell at black market rates.

“I bought petrol somewhere in Zone 4 around 3am. I slept there actually. The situation is worse than last week,” he said.

Marcus Anaga, another taxi driver said: “Right now, we call each other to know the filling station to go and sleep to get petrol.”

Other residents who spoke with Daily Sun regretted that the scarcity has disrupted economic and social activities and made the FCT chaotic. They queried why the scarcity has persisted despite assurances from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), oil marketers and other stakeholders that the trend would ease.

They also queried the veracity of NNPC’s claims of injecting 3.2 billion litres of petrol into the domestic market saying rather than have petrol to buy, filling stations in the FCT were either empty or flooded with thousands of frustrated consumers queuing endlessly to buy petrol.

It was observed that black market price of petrol that was hitherto N400 per litre earlier in the week had jumped to N700 even as motorists were forced to part with N500 tip for a jerrycan before petrol attendants were allowed to sell to them.

A black market dealer who identified himself as Aliyu said: “I buy petrol for N300 a litre from the pump and sell at N700 per litre. I’m making good sales. The scarcity is good.”

Mohammed, another black market operator, said products were available as from midnight.

“I buy at night, around 2am. When day breaks, I sell to rich men and women who don’t have time to queue at filling stations. I sell 10 litres for N6,500.”

Daily Sun observed that most of the petrol tankers have been parked at various filling stations for days without product to discharge.

The scarcity has badly impacted small and medium enterprises who rely on petrol generators to run their businesses.

Some supermarket owners in Abuja lamented that frozen foods in their freezers were defrosting and losing freshness due to lack of petrol to power their generators.

“Diesel is now N400 per litre, petrol price is worse, electricity is not stable. I dare not refuse to run my diesel and petrol generators if I want to remain in business. The chicken and ice cream sections are delicate. They can easily melt and decay. This is hell,” Mrs Ajani of CKD Supermarket in Kubwa lamented.","From Kubwa to Wuse, Maitama to Asokoro, most of the filling stations had ran out of fuel while the few that sold had long queues.

"365 Days to Presidential Election, the Aspirants are Emerging","Obinna Chima and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

Today makes it exactly a year to the 2023 presidential election and aspirants in the two main political parties – the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) – as well as some other parties, are positioning for the most coveted office in the land. They have started to throw their hats in the ring to indicate their interest.

Even though the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has yet to blow the whistle to signal the start of electioneering, the political space is buzzing with the activities of potential aspirants who have started doing the leg work early – meeting critical stakeholders in an effort to sell their aspiration and win critical endorsement.

Although about 11 individuals from diverse backgrounds have formally declared their intentions to vie for their party’s ticket, many of the big names being touted as nursing presidential ambitions are yet to make a formal announcement even though their footprints are all over the political space. Every occasion, official or unofficial is now a rally of sort with political undertone.

In the next few months the political space is expected to be crowded with the big names currently holding consultations in secret and in not so secret places – finally coming out to formally make their pitch.

Here are those who have declared so far.

Bola Tinubu

Since the former Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his desire to succeed him, he has been busy moving round the country and consulting with different interest groups and individuals. Already, groups such as SWAGA, the acronym for “South-West Agenda for Asiwaju,” populated by Tinubu’s acolytes and yes men, are already touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature.

Sam Ohuabunwa

The immediate past president of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, has declared to contest the position of the President in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ohuabunwa who had lamented worsening socio-economic and political conditions in the country, strongly believes he has what it takes to transform Nigeria. He said the greatest challenge that propelled his presidential ambition was the need to produce a new Nigeria where injustice is ruled out.

Anyim Pius Anyim

The former Senate President, and one time Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Anyim has declared his interest in the presidential race. He feels it was time for someone from the South-east to lead the country and has vowed to contest, whether the presidential slot is zoned to his zone or not. He strongly believes the next president should be able to rebuild, protect lives and property, revive the economy, create jobs and rehabilitate the collapsed educational system. According to him, the task ahead called for a candidate who possesses the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the PDP to accomplish the tasks. He believes he has what it takes to govern the country, particularly in these trying times.

Dele Momodu

Dele Momodu last month declared his presidential ambition in his hometown, Ihevbe, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State. According to the journalist and publisher of Ovation International magazine, he remains the most qualified among those aspiring to take over from Buhari next year. He insists that he might not have been a governor, senator, minister but he has sat with the high and mighty, adding that he’s qualified to become the president of the country.

Kingsley Moghalu

A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu has also declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Moghalu had said his decision to contest again for president was driven by concern for suffering Nigerians who seek an alternative to the status quo. The former CBN deputy governor contested the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in 2019 and has since moved to the African Democratic Congress (ADC).

Chukwuka Monye

43-year-old technocrat, Chukwuka Monye, in January, said the time to take over the governance from the older generation is now. To this end, the Delta State-born social innovator has declared his intention to contest for the president in the 2023 general elections. Monye whose slogan is “our future is now” wondered how the founding fathers would be content with Nigeria’s current state. Monye, is however, yet to state the party platform which he intends to contest.

Rochas Okorocha

The Imo West senator, Rochas Okorocha, recently made known his interest to contest for the office of the president in the 2023 general elections. In a letter to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, dated January 25, the former Imo State governor said what Nigeria needs right now is someone who is “detribalised” and can unite the country. This would be the third consecutive time the politician who claims to have built several schools for under-privileged Nigerians across the country would be throwing his hat in the ring.

Aminu Tambuwal

Aminu Tambuwal, is the current Sokoto state governor. The politician would be seeking to realise his ambition under the Peoples Democratic Party. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who declared his intention after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Sokoto, recently, said that he is not only well prepared but also ready to fix the numerous problems of the country. Generally perceived as urbane, Tambuwal will face off against other contenders in the opposition party during the party’s convention.

David Umahi

The present Ebonyi State Governor , David Umahi, declared his 2023 presidential ambition at the State House, in Abuja, coming about 24 hours after former Governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, also indicated an interest in the race. Both men are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi, speaking at a press briefing after meeting with Buhari, said his presidency will replicate his “progressive efforts” in Ebonyi at the national level. The Chairman of the South-east Governors’ Forum said he intends to bring a business-like spirit to governance, claiming that Buhari responded to his interest by asking him to seek the support of the people when he met with him to intimate the president of his intention.

Yahaya Bello

The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was one of the earliest Nigerians to have shown interest to aspire for the 2023 presidency under the banner of the ruling APC. Bello, however opened up in Bauchi, while addressing APC legislators as well as women groups from the North-east during an extraordinary meeting held in Bauchi at Hazibal hotel sometime ago.

The Kogi governor who has always touted his youthful age as an advantage, has described the task ahead as an enormous one.

Sani Yerima

The ex-Zamfara governor, Sani Yerima, has also declared his intention to govern the country. The politician while speaking during a BBC Hausa Service programme “Gane Mani Hanya” monitored in Gusau, said since Buhari is ending his second term, he (Yerima) would continue to pursue his presidential ambition.

“If God spares my life, by 2023 I would go into the contest for the post of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ” Yerima said.

Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi

An entrepreneur and youth development advocate, the young Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi, has promised to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace if given the platform to do so. She promised to harness the power of Nigerian teeming youths to unleash the country’s latent potential, which she described as a force to be reckoned with globally. She is the daughter of former Federal Commissioner of Works and Housing, Lateef Femi Okunnu (SAN).

Some of Those Yet to Declare…

Yemi Osinbajo

With the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, there are expectations that he would declare his interest in the coming days. Osinbajo clearly comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but appears to be keeping his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much. However, Nigerians are watching to see how Osinbajo would go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Tinubu, to actualise his ambition.

Atiku Abubakar

Despite the seeming opposition against his candidature, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023. Atiku’s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023. While some interest groups recently advised the former vice president not to contest and have labelled him the serial presidential aspirant, Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.

Godwin Emefiele

There has been an increasing call for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to join the presidential race. A technocrat with alluring pedigree – No doubt a breath of fresh in the political arena. Although Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone that he is running for president even as he is constitutionally qualified to so do, he has said he remains focused on his job and would continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government’s economic recovery drive. Emefiele also believes it’s the prerogative of President Buhari to plan his succession for the continuing peace and progress of Nigeria.

Bukola Saraki

The former Governor of Kwara State has not held any elaborate event to declare his ambition, but he has hinted on several occasions on his active Twitter and Facebook accounts, that he would likely be running for the most-sought-after position. On one occasion recently, the former President of the Senate, relayed an encounter with a follower on Twitter, who charged him to run and in his response, hinted at the possibility.

“Earlier, I replied to a follower of mine on Twitter, who like thousands of you, has been clamouring for a united front to #RescueNigeria. As we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us,” he had said.

Rotimi Amaechi

Even though former Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi has not declared his intention, some interest groups in the country have been nudging him to throw his hat in the battle to succeed the president. Some believe that at 56, Amaechi does not have the burden of old age-related health challenges associated with some aspirants. Many people have linked the 2023 presidency to his recent coronation as: Dan Amanah Daura, which translates to mean the ‘Trusted son of Daura.’

Bala Mohammed

Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed has said he is likely to run for president in the 2023 election under the PDP. Presently, he is consulting with stakeholders across the country and recently met with former president Goodluck Jonathan.

Nigeria Set for 5G Rollout as FG Releases Spectrum Allocation,"•NCC to licence operators after February 27

Emma Okonji in Lagos and Oghenevwede Ohwovoriole in Abuja

The federal government yesterday in Abuja, officially handed over Spectrum Allocation for 5G deployment to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who doubles as the Chairman of the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), did the official handover of the Spectrum Allocation for 5G licence to the NCC during a workshop on the National Policy on 5G Networks and handover of Spectrum Allocation for deployment, in Abuja.

Aside the official handover of the 5G spectrum to the NCC, the Minister also did an official public handover of the National Policy on 5G Network for Nigeria’s Digital Economy to the NCC.

Based on the official handover of the 5G spectrum, the NCC was expected to licence winners of the 5G spectrum after February 27, when it must have given full update of the payment of the licence fees by the winners, to enable 5G network rollout in the country.

NCC was expected to make formal announcement on the update of payment for 5G licence on February 27, 2022, in line with the Information Memorandum for 3.5GHz spectrum, which is the 5G licence spectrum.

The Commission had on December 13, 2021, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, successfully auctioned two slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum band to MTN Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, at a bid price of $273.6 million for each operator.

The successful auction of the 3.5GHz spectrum band would pave way for the issuance of a fifth generation (5G) licence that would facilitate the deployment of 5G network across Nigeria.

After the successful auction of the spectrum, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, had announced that the winners were expected to make payment for the spectrum license, on or before February 24, 2022, to enable them roll out the 5G network across the country.

Before the successful spectrum auction in December last year, the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), was occupying five slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum, but vacated two slots, which were handed over to the National Frequency Management Council, chaired by the Minister.

Pantami advised state governors to look beyond the money they would collect from network operators who will deploy the 5G in their states, but see the gain that its deployment would bring to their respective states and the Nigerian economy in general.

Pantami said, “The issue of right of way becomes a challenge from time to time. The government has addressed the issue more than ninety per cent but from time to time issues may come. I do hope that they will understand the economic benefit. The security benefits and many more of these technological advancement.

“It is beyond right of way charges. It goes beyond that. So let us try to make the process very easy for operators so that they will be able to deploy 5G.”

He added that the adoption of 5G technologies and its roll out would support in the development of Nigeria’s digital economy

“5G will provide very fast and reliable communication for our security personnel and allow then to swiftly access relevant data required to carry out their duties. The time required to access data for records from hours minutes.

“5G will allow for real time high quality and data intensive surveillance of relevant areas using high definition cameras.

“Emerging technologies like Blockchain can significantly improve transparency to the delivery of government services at all levels.

“The World Economic Forum attests to the potential of Blockchain to increase the efficiency and fairness of government system and by extension limit opportunities for corruption.

It can significantly improve transparency in procurement procedures enhance land and registry system, ensure that government documents are not accessed by unauthorised personal,” he stressed

The minister also spoke on the national policy on 5G deployment in the country, saying, “the National Policy for 5G diploma in Nigeria for our country’s digital economy is also going to be distributed after the luncheon we use the occasion for the public presentation of the policy and we encourage our stakeholders to look into it and ensure a very successful implementation of the policy on what we had been doing.

“According to February 2021 report by Accentuate, 5G-enabled factories can see up to 2O-30 per cent in overall productivity gains including improvement of 50 per cent in assemble time.

These are only a few examples to show how 5G can have a positive impact on our economy,” he added.

In his contribution, Danbatta said: “On the 25th January, 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari, unveiled the National Policy on 5G Networks at the Presidential Villa.

“This singular action triggered today’s event – the presentation of the 5G policy to the general public and for our critical stakeholders to officially witness the National Frequency Management Council presenting the Spectrum allocated for 5G technology to the Nigerian Communications Commission. To all members of the National Frequency Management Council, your efforts are truly appreciated and your recommendations have been immensely helpful.”

Former Secretary General and Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) and CEO of Tetconsult, UK and Nigeria, Shola Taylor, who presented the lead paper on the benefits of 5G deployment in Nigeria, said: “5G is a reality and the impact on our lives is real and the benefits are endless. Nigeria is already in it. We have started well and must be prepared for the disruption that will come in spite of the challenges. We cannot go back. We cannot remain where we are so the only option is to move forward and move quickly.”

Giving details about 5G network, Taylor said 5G would continue to be attractive and revolutionary in nation building because it offers lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth. “This means higher data speeds, faster connections for use by individuals and businesses,” Taylor added.

The Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Aziz, said the success of the implementation of the policy would largely depend of good collaboration between all stakeholders in the country.

Also, the Director General Galaxy Back Bone, Prof. Mohammed Abubarka, said the deployment of 5G and the implementation of the nation’s digital policy would help to achieve President Buhari’s government’s transparency and boost the economy.

"Emefiele: CBN Passionate about Youth Empowerment, Economic Restructuring","Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba

Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has expressed commitment to various programmes targeted at youth empowerment and restructuring of the Nigerian economy in order to move it away from its over-dependence on oil revenue.

The CBN governor who made the remarks at a two-day CBN Fair, which opened in Asaba yesterday, said he was passionate about empowering youths, especially young graduates through various initiatives to support small and medium scale enterprises as well as agricultural support schemes.

He noted that the unprecedented rice pyramid witnessed in Abuja, recently and the over 160 per cent rise in the number of rice mills in the country was an evidence that the CBN’s intervention in agriculture sector was yielding fruits.

Similarly, he said the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) of the apex bank and other development finance interventions greatly helped in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through the various palliatives that Nigerians benefited from.

He stressed the need for all hands to be on the deck to tackle the economic challenges facing Nigeria.

The Corporate Communications Director, CBN, Mr. Osita Nwanisoba, who represented Emiefele, at the fair, noted that growing a diversified economy that would meet contemporary challenges in a sustainable manner underscored the intervention programmes of the apex bank.

He stressed the need for Nigerians to understand the history of their economy and to know how they could key into the numerous intervention programmes and schemes designed to restructure the country’s economic base from its monoculture status.

He assured that the CBN has been consistently proactive in ensuring that its initiatives were in tune with global trends, including digitalisation and smart internet innovations in the financial world.

He said the fact that Nigeria was the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency, the e-Naira on October 26, 2021, testified to the proactive state of the CBN.

He said, “First and foremost, it is important for us to know where we are coming from and where we are going, because the understanding of the past will help us to understand why the CBN is doing what it is doing. Like I said, Nigeria is a mono-product economy; mono-product because 90 per cent of our foreign exchange (FX) revenue come from oil and about 60 per cent of our expenditure also comes from oil. What this means is that whenever there is a shock out there it immediately translates to our economy.

“So, it becomes even more problematic for the CBN to be able to deal with its mandate. And, we have a clear mandate, which we understand, but we feel that to be able to actualise this mandate, there are other things we need to do, and that is, to stimulate growth, to grow the economy in a sustainable manner.

“What the CBN is doing is to diversify the economic base of this country. We are saying that there are so many and so much that we can do. We have agriculture, we have manufacturing. So, why can we deal with these things so that we will be able to produce what we eat and eat what we produce?

“Basically, that is why the CBN is intervening in the critical sectors of the economy. These are sectors that would grow the economy, create jobs, ensure that there is export so that we will be able to moderate our exchange rate and earn even more FX and grow our external reserves.”

On the significance of the e-Naira to the central bank’s efforts to restructure the economy, the representative of the CBN governor said there was need to move the country in the direction other economies were going.

“I think the first thing we have to understand is that we are gradually moving into what I will call the knowledge economy. We have also seen what digitalisation is doing across the world. Like I said earlier, as countries begin to move away from more fossil fuel to digital economy, it becomes imperative that you need to be at pace with what is going on.

“Today, we to talk about a web economy, we talk about internet economy, we talk about quantum computing and the rest of them.

“So, Nigeria felt that we needed to deal with this, leveraging on the sophisticated payment infrastructure that we have and launched its own digital currency. It is the first in Africa. It’s quite phenomenal. I think it is the sixth in the world.”

“Recently, we launched the TIES – the Tertiary Institution Entrepreneurship Scheme – the whole essence is to empower the youths so that they will unleash their productive potentials.

“Therefore, some of the takeaways from this fair is that the CBN is a listening institution. Like the CBN Governor always say, that he wants a people-centred central bank. Two, to understand that there are interventions of the CBN and to know how to leverage these interventions.”

"Power Supply: FG Targets 27,000 Homes, Signs €9.3m Deal for Provision of 23-Mini-grids Nationwide","Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

The federal government has signed an Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme (IMAS) deal with eight indigenous solar mini-grid developers for the establishment of 23 mini-grids across 11 states of the country.

Expected to generate a 5.4-kilowatt peak to connect about 27,600 households, and impact over 138,000 Nigerians in two years, the €9.3 million project is being coordinated by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) with support from the European Union and the German government.

At the award signing ceremony, the Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, said the programme was geared towards achieving the country’s vision of generating at least 30, 000 megawatts of electricity by 2030.

Jedy-Agba noted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was always open to opportunities that would achieve the acceleration of electricity in Nigeria.

According to him, the national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, vision 30:30:30 aim at achieving 30,000 megawatts of electricity by the year 2030, with renewable energy contributing 30 per cent of the energy mix. To achieve this, the minister stated that Nigeria would have to construct over a thousand mini-grids of 100 kilowatts.

The minister added that it was important to continue to find creative and innovative ways to achieve the objective, and one of which was through collaborating with development partners and the private sector.

He added: “We understand that one of the major bottlenecks for the private sector’s involvement is financing, hence, the reason the NESP and REA have worked closely to develop and implement the scheme.”

The eight local solar mini-grid developers include Acob Lighting Technology Limited, Gve Projects, Nayo Tropical Technology Limited, Rubitec Nigeria Limited and Darway Coast Nigeria Limited, Synergy Limited, Sosa-Protergia Joint Development Company Limited, and A4&T Power Solutions Limited.

They would receive in-kind grants through the REA with support of the European Union and the German Government within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).

The indigenous developers are expected to establish 23 mini-grids across 11 states, which include, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Anambra, and Cross River.

Earlier, the Managing Director of REA, Ahmad Salihijo said the scheme was aimed at bridging the funding gap affecting indigenous developers in the renewable energy sector.

“It is our hope that the signatures we put down today in these documents set a precedent for the new and improved power and energy sector in Nigeria.

“As an agency, we encourage investors to explore the solar mini-grid sector. However, one major constraint to this is usually financing. This is why the REA, with the support of NESP, is working together to alleviate this bottleneck.

“We do this by providing in-kind grants to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,” he stressed.

According to him, the main objective of the intervention is to design and test a tender model for interconnected solar mini-grids, leading to the foundation of the scheme.

“The wonderful thing about the IMAS project is that we have ensured that all the developers are Nigerians. This is to say that the Nigerian energy sector has come a long way from what it used to be and we are proud of this,” he explained.

Head of programme, NESP, Benjamin Duke, assured that his team would continue to work to build investors’ confidence in the sector by developing an accurate electricity market intelligence that will provide investors with accurate data about the country’s electricity needs.

Also speaking at the ceremony, the Executive Director, Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Sanusi Ohiare, said while investors were being encouraged to explore the solar mini-grid sector, one major constraint to their project development was finance.

“Hence, the REA with the support of NESP was able to alleviate this major burden by providing capital in-kind grant to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,” he noted.

Head of Section, Green Economy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Inga Stefanowicz, noted that the EU’s financial support for the programme represents the EU’s commitment to support Nigeria in the efforts to enable more investments in the solar mini-grid sector.

“We hope that our contribution will help improve access to reliable and affordable electricity in Nigeria, especially in the disadvantaged areas of the country, hence advancing the living standard of the rural and peri-urban dwellers using renewable sources of energy,” she stated.

Country Director of GIZ Nigeria & ECOWAS, Ina Hommers, said the provision of capital in-kind grants to the developers in the solar mini-grid sector through the IMAS aimed to ensure higher investments in the sector.

“Therefore, the grants contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria, in particular SDG 7 on access to affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. These represent one of the focal areas of GIZ’s support to Nigeria,” Hommers stressed.

Depending on the ability of the private sector, between 18 to 24 solar mini-grid projects will be deployed in 2022 under the project, serving clean electricity to around 138,000 people in Nigeria.

"Nigerian Air Force, Customs Partner To Secure Borders, Tackle Banditry, Smuggling, Others","The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to partner in order to strengthen border security and stem the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points.

NAF spokesperson Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet disclosed this in a statement on Thursday.

According to the Gabkwet, the air force is expected to make available on request 2 of its pilots to assist with the operation of NCS Bell-427 helicopters.

The statement read, “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to synergize their efforts towards strengthening border security and stemming the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points. To this end, the NAF is expected to make available on request 2 of its pilots to assist with the operation of NCS Bell-427 helicopters and by so doing complement the manpower of NCS Air-Wing.

“This information is part of the content of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently consummated between both organizations. The MoU specifically sets out the terms of a joint commitment, which is expected to enhance efficiency in the areas of port and border patrols to curtail activities of smuggling syndicates across the country.”

Speaking at the event, which was held at the NCS Headquarters, Abuja, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, who was represented by the Director of Operations, Headquarters NAF, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Nnamdi Ananaba stated that the NAF will continue to encourage partnership with other security agencies as well as provide aircraft maintenance support so as to enhance the fight against all forms of insecurity in the country.

He added that the NAF partnership with the NCS was a clear indication of the need for synergy and inter-agency cooperation, particularly between military and para-military organizations.

“The MoU will go a long way in building on the already existing cordial and cooperative relationship as well as ensure seamless collaboration between our organizations,” he said.

Air Vice-Marshal Ananaba went on to note that the current security challenges in the country call for the need to bridge the gap and divide that disconnects the military and other government agencies in order to work towards achieving a common goal.

The Comptroller General of NCS, Colonel Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd), in his remarks, noted that the partnership with the NAF will no doubt improve NCS’ air operations and anti-smuggling efforts particularly as it intensifies efforts in checkmating small arms proliferation across the country.

Ali also thanked the CAS for offering to deploy NAF pilots to NCS’ air operations wing, so as to enhance its anti-smuggling operations.

He also called on the NAF and other Services to consider partnering with the NCS in the areas of capacity building and purposeful manpower development to improve the output of NCS personnel.

Specifically, the customs boss requested the assistance of the armed forces of Nigeria in the training of NCS personnel in para-trooping and other related fields. This, according to him, became necessary in view of inaccessible areas used as smuggling routes which are mostly unmotorable and difficult to navigate, hence the need for the NCS to begin to consider inserting its troops in these locations via para-dropping.

The MoU signing ceremony had in attendance key management staff of NCS as well as senior officers from the NAF.","The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to partner in order to strengthen border security and stem the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points.

Blessing Okagbare gets 10-year ban for doping,"The disciplinary tribunal of Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has handed Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian sprinter, a 10-year ban for breaching multiple anti-doping rules.

According to the statement released by AIU on Friday, the Nigerian got a five-year ban for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and another half-a-decade for her refusal to cooperate with the body’s investigation of her case.

The sprinter was suspended indefinitely during the Tokyo Olympics after the AIU had adjudged her to have tested positive for human growth hormone in one of the out-of-competition drug examinations she did in Slovakia on July 19.

She was thereafter slammed with three separate anti-doping charges by the body in October 2021.

In January 2022, the US department of justice had also allegedly identified Okagbare among the exhibits gathered against Eric Lira, the self-acclaimed kinesiologist and naturopathic doctor, who provided performance-enhancing drugs to athletes who participated at the Tokyo Olympics.

The 33-year-old has now been prohibited from all track and field events organised by World Athletics for the next decade.

“The Disciplinary Tribunal has banned Nigerian sprinter Blessing Okagbare for a total of 10 years, five years for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and five years for her refusal to co-operate with the AIU’s investigation into her case,” the statement read.

“The sole arbitrator adjudicating the case concluded that the athlete’s use of multiple prohibited substances as part of an organised doping regimen in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympic Games was egregious conduct that amounted to aggravating circumstances under the Rules thereby warranting an additional period of ineligibility on top of the standard four-year sanction.

“The sole arbitrator also recognised the AIU’s right to carry out investigations, including the imaging of electronic devices, and to impose sanctions when an athlete refuses to co-operate with an investigation and thereby frustrates the AIU’s ability to fulfil its mandate to protect the integrity of the sport of athletics.

“In this instance, the sole arbitrator concluded that the athlete’s refusal to cooperate had denied the AIU the opportunity to discover evidence of possible further rule violations by her as well possible violations of the rules by others, for which he imposed an additional sanction of five years.”

The statement added that the athlete has the right to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CaS) within 30 days.","The disciplinary tribunal of Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has handed Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian sprinter, a 10-year ban for breaching multiple anti-doping rules.

Lagos shuts school over ‘brutal flogging’ of two-year old pupil,"The Lagos state government has shut down Unic Vilos Montessori school after a two-year-old pupil was allegedly brutalised by her teacher.

According to Channels TV, Folashade Adefisayo, the state’s commissioner for education, confirmed that the ministry has ordered the closure of the school.

Adefisayo disclosed that the affected school operates without approval. She also said the state government is on the verge to to clamp down on such centres of learning.

Last week Friday, a relative to the pupil had alleged that the yet-to-be-identified teacher “brutally flogged” the little girl “because she could not recite the English alphabet.”

The incident had attracted a wave of criticism on social media platforms, with several Nigerians condemning the teacher’s action.

It also raised concerns over the rising cases of teachers subjecting their pupils to hostile treatments.

In his reaction, Jubril Gawat, special assistant on new media to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, said the case is already under probe.

According to him, the issue is being investigated by a joint team consisting of the ministries of education, justice as well as youth and social development.

The incident occurred at about the same time when another teacher in Delta was accused of subjecting a 19-month-old pupil to “brutal flogging”.

The toddler was said to have died a few days after the beating.

17 feared dead as petrol tanker collides with vehicle on Lagos-Ibadan expressway,"At least 17 persons reportedly died in an accident involving a Mazda bus and a petrol tanker at Isara Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway on Friday.

The collision was said to have resulted in a fire outbreak.

Ahmed Umar, the sector commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun, confirmed the incident to NAN.

Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases,"In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.

The growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021—its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.

Scams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called “rug pull”. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.

Cryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.

DeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.

DeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth—1,964%—for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens—all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.

While Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent “tokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges”.

Apart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.

In a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won’t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales—private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.

Despite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America’s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized £180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.

Earlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple’s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.

It’s all about seed rounds ￼,"Share this article:













Hello there,

The financial sector experienced a tremendous change last year, with massive growth in the use of digital financial services.

According to CB Insights’ ‘State of Fintech’ report, the third quarter of 2021 was the second highest on record for fintech financing, up 147 percent year on year, and 2022 appears to be more of the same.

It’s expected that fintechs will continue to drive financial inclusion, assisting in the development of a more accessible and sustainable digital economy for all, particularly in developing countries.

According to leading fintech enablement partner, Ukheshe Technologies, some of the biggest fintech trends poised to make an impact in the financial sector in 2022, include cross-border payments, mobile money, and buy now, pay later.

While this is most likely correct, given that African fintech company, Flutterwave, recently announced a $250 million Series D round, do you think any other industry will be able to compete with fintech companies in five years’ to a decade’s time in terms of financing? Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.

Well, today, I’ll be discussing:

Solving critical bankend freight industry challenges

Earnipay’s plans to reach 200,000 employees

Solving critical backend freight industry challenges















We all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.

For most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.

One of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.

Partech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.

Founded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.

According to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.

He also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company’s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.

Earnipay’s plans to reach 200,000 employees















Earnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.

The round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.

Nonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees’ financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.

Earnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.

What’s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.

By the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.

Nigeria’s shrinking economy records highest ‘growth’ under Buhari,"Nigeria’s economy may have grown by the most since 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari was first voted into office, but the size of the economy has shrunk since then and Nigerians are worse off.

The shrinking size of the economy means there is a smaller pie to share among Nigeria’s 200 million people, a painful squeeze for a country that is home to the world’s largest number of poor people.

That explains why many Nigerians can not relate with the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures put out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), according to Deji Obe, a Nigerian youth who has been without a job since what would be the first of two recessions in five years in 2016.

“The data gives the impression that things are finally getting better now that GDP growth has outpaced population growth for the first time since 2015,” Obe said. “But in reality, times are still very hard.”

The economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2021, the NBS said Thursday, marking the fastest growth rate in 7 years, helped by an improvement in the trade sector and low base effects. But the economy is valued at only $436.29 billion, 20 percent less than it was worth in 2014 ($546.67 billion). In that time the population has grown 13 percent.

“GDP numbers in isolation is incomplete when measuring the health of an economy, other factors like unemployment, poverty rate, inflation and human development index matter and Nigeria is nowhere near the desired level,” said Muda Yusuf , an economist and former head of trade advocacy group, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).

Nigeria is not only the world’s poverty capital, ahead of India which has five times its population, it’s unemployment rate at 33 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia and it has 7th highest inflation rate in Africa.

A cocktail of poor economic policies has made life in Nigeria tough, according to observers,

as tough as it has ever been in a long time.

Economists say the country’s performance in 2021, not significantly improved from the chaotic years since the recession in 2016, is made to look impressive by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when the economy shrank by the most in over two decades.

“The magnitude at which the economy contracted in 2020 has certainly had a big role to play in the 2021 growth numbers so it is no surprise,” said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and partner at consulting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC).

“The challenges the economy has faced since 2016 have not gone away, there is still a need for more fiscal and monetary reforms to take growth to sustainable levels,” Oyedele said.

While economists say the relatively high growth rate in 2021 is largely as a result of base effects, Harry Simon, who heads the government-owned NBS, could not agree more.

He said the impact of the low base effect could not be ruled out as it played a significant role in achieving the current figures and that it was not time to celebrate.

Trade sector records positive growth first time in 6yrs,"For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria’s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

According to the GDP report released Thursday by the NBS, the trade sector grew 8.62 percent.

Before now, it had contracted by 8.49 percent, 0.38 percent, 0.63 percent, 1.05 percent, and 0.24 percent in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Also, the growth rate in 2021 is the highest since 2012 (9.61%).

“The positive growth can be attributed to the low base effect, full reopening of the economy and the removal of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which has made activities in the trade sector to be much easier leading to its recovery,” Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, says.

Commenting in the same vein, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, notes that the recovery shows that businesses and economic activities have improved in the sector

“But despite the recovery, I am still bothered because the structural challenges such as high cost of foreign exchanges, weak demand, logistics issues, etc. still linger in the sector,” Adewale states.

The report also highlights that the country’s overall GDP grew by 3.98 percent (year-on-year) in Q4 ‘2021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 percent and -3.62 percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the pandemic.

“The fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 percent in 2021,” it states.

In terms of contribution to GDP, the trade sector contributed 15.66 percent, higher than the 15.46 percent it represented in the previous year, and higher than the 14.93 percent recorded in Q3 ‘2021.

Trade, which is the second biggest sector by output production, can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.

And due to this, the sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.

But in Africa’s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative territory since 2016 over myriad challenges like macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira’s depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.

Recently, a report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria’s real household consumption as a proportion of GDP rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post-pandemic for Nigeria’s consumer’s industry.

Additionally, a 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) reported that the country’s total retail sales rose to $108 billion after it had been trending south, falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015.

Analysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, said the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19.

Also, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says people have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones, noting, “E-commerce has also made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy.”","For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria’s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

LASAA launches e-Sticker verifier app for mobile advert registration,"The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the agency responsible for the regulation and control of all forms of signs and outdoor advertisement displays in Lagos State, has launched a dedicated e-Sticker Verification Application (app) for mobile avert registration by its clients.

The app which, according to the Agency, is available on Google and IOS store will help clients to authenticate the mobile advert Quick Response (QR) code issued to them by LASAA.

Speaking on the new app during the launch at the Agency’s head office recently, Managing Director of the Agency, Prince Adedamola Docemo explained that the LASAA e-Sticker Verification App is a reliable platform that allows LASAA field officers or law enforcement agencies to verify the authenticity of brand publication on automobiles in Lagos State.

“This innovation from the Lagos Signage Advertising Agency is a user-friendly interface that detects the brand registration information on stickers generated by LASAA to organisations and individuals respectively,” he said.

Docemo added that having registered brand information for automobiles on the LASAA sticker web platform and stickers generated, a field officer only needs to have the LASAA QR Code reader, which will decode the registration information of the branded publication.

Speaking further on the details of the application, LASAA’s Head of Corporate Communication & Strategy, Mr. Temitope Akande noted that information regarding the organisation or individual name, plate number (where applicable), brand type, vehicle type and branding type will be displayed seamlessly to verify the authenticity of the sticker.

“This platform has been developed to ensure branded automobiles have authorised stickers and to eradicate any occurrence of falsified brand information,” Akande said.

To use the application, clients should simply download and install the LASAA e-Sticker Verifier App from the Google store or App store.

Since the new mobile advert e-sticker was first launched and adopted in December 2021, the implication is that all old stickers became invalid, effective 1st of January 2022. The new sticker is aimed at stemming the activities of fraudsters and touts as well as middlemen who try to impersonate the staff of the Agency.","The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the agency responsible for the regulation and control of all forms of signs and outdoor advertisement displays in Lagos State, has launched a dedicated e-Sticker Verification Application (app) for mobile avert registration by its clients.

UNIAbuja VC Commends Federal Govt For Road Rehabilitation,"The vice-chancellor of the University of Abuja (UNIAbuja), Professor Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah has expressed appreciation to minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola and President Muhammadu Buhari for the rehabilitation of roads in the university.

Na’Allah made the appreciation during the formal handing over of 1.05 km of rehabilitated roads by the ministry under its intervention initiative in Abuja on Thursday.

He said what the government did is a gesture in the right direction, adding that what needs is huge because this is not up to what we need now but we are grateful.

“We have been trouble with the horrible road in the campus, if you go round, nobody needs not to tell you that roads are horrible, sometimes even dangerous, not just main campus, even Giri quarters and mini campus, these are the crisis we facing.”

“I have asked for a map of the entire main campus, very soon this map would be ready, that will specifically be described what is wrong, what we need, drainage system and we hope the ministry would come back to do more”.

In his remarks, the minister who was represented by Federal Controller of Works FCT, Engr. Yakubu Usman explained that Without quality education, a society can not develop, so it is quite significant.

“The quality of education will be impacted by the quality of infrastructure and the learning environment because education is the bedrock for functional and sustainable development and is the foundation of society.

“The gap of our infrastructure needs is steadily being bridged by a gradual process of repairs, renewal, and construction on major highways and it has reached the schools,” he said.

NNPC’s Energy Bank Proposal Receives African Oil Producers Backing,"African Oil producers have expressed support for the establishment of an energy bank to facilitate financing of major oil and gas projects in the continent.

The proposed energy bank is a decision being considered after Western nations threatened to halt overseas fossil fuel financing.

The decision has sparked alarm among Africa’s largest hydrocarbon exporters. But plans are afoot to create a new pan-African energy bank that can tackle waning oil and gas investment and drive-up production across the continent.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, and the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) are exploring the idea of establishing a so-called ‘African Energy Bank.’

ADVERTISEMENT

Afreximbank could not be reached for comment about the proposal, but the move has been cheered by industry lobby group, the African Energy Chamber, which says the value of such a bank ‘cannot be overstated.’

“Capital from foreign countries and companies will always be welcome, however regarding oil and gas, it isn’t reliable,” the group said in a statement.

“Therefore, through institutions such as the African energy bank, local oil and gas companies will be able to boost new and existing project developments; ensure reliable financing channels for oil and gas; and position the continent as a net exporter of hydrocarbons, all while creating critical capital opportunities for renewable energy projects,” it added.

The move comes about five months after minister of State for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, called for African governments to look into the initiative.

“If we insist on the exploration of our oil and gas reserves when the world is cutting down on investments in the sector, we must set a financial institution, an African Energy Bank, to develop the oil and gas sector,” Sylva said in September last year.

Speaking to Global Trade Review about the push to create an energy-focused bank on the continent, Adrian Lawrence, a partner in law firm Ashurst’s projects practice, says the initiative has been driven by the retreat of public and private finance from fossil fuels.

At the Cop26 climate summit in November, a number of countries pledged to end direct public financing for overseas fossil fuel development by the end of 2022, and to prioritise clean energy instead.

Already, many African countries rely heavily on oil and gas for their electricity needs. BP’s latest statistical review of world energy report shows the two fuels were responsible for roughly 48% of the continent’s total electricity generation in 2020.

“Large amounts of capital [will be needed] to implement these transition plans while supplying increasing amounts of power to their populations,” Lawrence said.

“There is thus a growing disconnect between the increasing financing needs of many African countries at a time when there is a narrowing range of institutions able or willing to fund even the most ‘bankable’ of [oil and gas] projects,” he added.

As the industry awaits the release of further details on the new energy bank, questions inevitably arise about how such an institution would find the necessary capital, with Africa’s major petroleum producers all suffering from a chronic lack of investment in recent years.","African Oil producers have expressed support for the establishment of an energy bank to facilitate financing of major oil and gas projects in the continent.

"Aregbesola, CSOs Trade Tackles Over Violence In Osun","Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State yesterday trade blame over the recent clash between the minister’s camp and that of the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, which attracted the attention of security agencies.

Reacting to the feud between the Osun State governor and the minister on the attendant spate of violence in the state, the coalition of CSO’O cast the first stone when it called on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the former governor of the state to order.

Addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, the coalition comprising The Osun Masterminds, Transparency and Accountability Group (TAG), Centre for Sustainable Dialogue (CSD), Oodua Youth Parliament (OYP), Osun Young Professionals (OYP), and Nigerians for Good Governance (NGG), alleged that the former Osun State governor and Interior Minister has been using security agencies under his control to threaten peace in the South-West state by instigating violence.

Dr Wasiu Oyedokun Alli, who spoke on behalf of the coalition said, “While superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.

“We have seen recently how men of the NSCDC, the NIS and the NCS sporadically shot in the air to terrify citizens of the State in Osogbo and other towns within the State. We refer to the official release of the Osun State Police Command, concerning the actions of men of the NSCDC, NIS and NCS.”

The Coalition urged President Buhari to sack Aregbesola from his cabinet ahead of July 16 governorship election in the state, accusing him of “shows of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the state, denigration of elder statesmen.

But firing back at the CSOs, Aregbesola asked Nigerians to disregard the CSOs, saying they are “the rent-a-crowd pseudo-NGOs.”

Speaking through his media assistant, Sola Fasure, the minister insisted that he was the victim rather than the aggressor in the violence perpetrated so far in the state.

He said, “It is on record that on Monday whilst returning from a well-attended political sensitisation rally in Ilesa, known hoodlums attacked the convoy of the Minister as he approached the popular Old Garage junction in Osogbo.

“His convoy comprising of well-trained officers of the Department of State Security, The Nigeria Police Force (charged with protecting the minister) and other security personnel drawn from the Paramilitary services, professionally responded to the daring attackers who were armed with diverse sophisticated weapons.

“Having failed to achieve their mission of killing the minister on Monday, the sponsors of the evil plot have now resorted to smearing his name, hoping to achieve through the back door, what they can’t get fairly on the field.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the minister is aware of his constitutional role as a member of the governing cabinet, a leading light of the ruling All Progressives Congress and as the Minister of Interior, charged with providing security for the nation.”

“However, the Minister, just like other Nigerians, also has the democratic right of association as enshrined in our constitution. This, in our opinion, doesn’t deserve the murder of any Nigerian, talk-less of a serving minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”","Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State yesterday trade blame over the recent clash between the minister’s camp and that of the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, which attracted the attention of security agencies.

WHO reports first wild polio outbreak in Malawi,"In Africa, the landlocked country of Malawi has reported the first wild polio outbreak on the continent in several years.

The wild type 1 poliovirus was discovered in a child in the city of Lilongwe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Friday.

Laboratory tests had shown that it had apparently been brought in from Pakistan, it said.

“As long as wild polio exists anywhere in the world all countries remain at risk of importation of the virus,” said WHO regional director Matshidiso Moeti.

The organisation will support local health authorities in the south-east African country to ensure that the case remains isolated and does not spread, she said.

Polio is a contagious infectious disease and can cause paralysis and death.

Except for Afghanistan and Pakistan, all countries in the world had beaten the wild polioviruses.

2023: Tambuwal Is PDP’s Best Bet For Presidency — GNC,"The Generation Next Collective, a group of youth and women’s organizations, has described Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as the finest candidate the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, can field for the 2023 presidential election.

As a result, the committee urged the party’s leadership to act quickly and be more explicit about the path the party plans to take in selecting its presidential candidate for the 2023 race.

“One person, in our estimation, that ticks the right boxes, is the Governor of Sokoto State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A lawyer, lawmaker, public administrator and chief executive of a state in the past seven years, it is our view and those of many, that the PDP would not be making a mistake with his choice and wealth of experience,” the group said.

GNC’s position was contained in a statement released by its co- conveners, Barrister Ruth Edehemon and Malam Rufai Abdulahi, in Abuja yesterday. It read:

“Across the nation, there is a general consensus, that 2023 election, should as a matter of importance, answer some nagging questions, among which are equity, justice and inclusion, the key tripod that ensure democratic balance.

“And PDP as a democratic party, should not shy away from this conversation that is rooted in fairness and truth. Beyond sentiments, the South and North are deserving of fair play and inclusion, a twin democratic feature that have been unwittingly starved by the government in power and would require an urgent restoration for the common good and unity of our dear nation.

“It is expedient that the PDP addresses the lingering ambiguity over which zone the presidential candidate should come from; and follow it up by building an honest purpose-driven, robust consensus, as may be allowed by law, around a suitable aspirant that possesses not only the leadership skill to unite the nation, but also be a veritable linkage between the older and the current generations; such that the sublimity of wisdom and restraint of leadership would find a meeting point with the treasure trove of the energy, creativity and ingenuity of the youth demography.

” Incontrovertible records show that the PDP as a party has managed the affairs of the nation at the presidency level for 16 years. And it’s a fact that the Southern part of the nation had held sway for over 14 years of the 16, through former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo 8 years (1999 -2007) and Goodluck Jonathan, 6 years (2010 – 2015). While the North had only ruled for a little over two years under the late former President Umaru Yar’Adua, who unfortunately died in office.

“So, we strongly believe that rather than this disturbing silence that is eliciting enflamed passion and seeming confusion, over the zone that should be supported for presidency in 2023 in the PDP, the party should be bold to speak up by putting this record into consideration, bring its leaders from both the North and South on a round table, address their deferent sentiments, do necessary in-house negotiations and present a formidable, united front that would give the party a meaningful chance in the challenge ahead.”

On the aspirant from the North with requisite leadership and managerial experience, personality and public appeal, that could benefit from the consensus approach, the GNC said: “With no prejudice to other prominent aspirants from the zone in PDP, the party should build consensus around someone with less controversy or negative public sentiments, with an unquestionable vigour for the demanding job of a president, essentially now that public scrutiny is rising over age and other physical variables of potential candidates, ahead of the general election.

“One person, in our estimation, that ticks the right boxes, is the Governor of Sokoto State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A lawyer, lawmaker, public administrator and chief executive of a state in the past seven years, it is our view and those of many, that the PDP would not be making a mistake with his choice and wealth of experience.

“Tambuwal’s privileged interactions with different interests, sectors and segments in and out of the Nigerian society, would enrich the contest and brighten the chances of the PDP, should it act fast and rally its faithful, contacts and resources around him.

"BREAKING: Buhari Government To Tax Goods, Services Brought In By Companies Without Nigerian Offices","The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has announced that it will begin taxing non-resident corporations who bring products or services into Nigeria.

The agency stated in a statement signed by Johannes Oluwatobi Wojuola, its Special Assistant to the Executive Chairman (Media & Communication), that it would use the Finance Act 2021’s instrumentality to raise revenue for Nigeria by collaborating with taxpayers and other stakeholders.

Muhammad Nami, the FIRS’ Executive Chairman, was quoted as saying this on Thursday while giving the keynote talk at KPMG’s Webinar on Nigeria’s 2022 Budget and the Finance Act 2021.

Nma said, “In the past, situations abound where certain goods or services streamed into Nigeria by non-resident companies, especially to consumers (B2Cs), were not subject to VAT. This raised the issue of equity, as goods and services offered by domestic companies are subject to VAT.

“With the amendment of Section 10 of the VAT Act and our publication of the ‘Guidelines on Simplified VAT Compliance Regime for Non-Resident Suppliers’, there is now a mechanism for applying VAT on such goods or services, affording the same tax treatment to both local and foreign supplies.



“Similarly, companies deriving income from Nigeria without physical presence can now be assessed, like other companies with physical presence, on fair and reasonable percentage of their turnover in line with Section 30 of CITA.”



On the automation of tax processes, the FIRS Executive Chairman noted that “with the amendment of Section 25 of the FIRS Establishment Act, the Service can now deploy either proprietary or third-party developed technologies for tax administration.”

“Those that may still stand in the way of achieving this objective will now be liable to a daily penalty of N25,000,” it added.

“With the extension of secrecy and confidentiality requirements to other persons, like service providers, vendors and consultants of the Service, the fear of taxpayers is further allayed on the secrecy and confidentiality of their commercial and other information,” it said.



Muhammad Nami further noted that with the amendment to Section 68 of the FIRS Establishment Act by the Finance Act, complaints from taxpayers about multiple agencies of government demanding payment of tax from them has been addressed.



He said, “This unfortunate situation is not in line with the national tax policy thrust and was causing confusion for our taxpayers and increasing their cost of compliance.

“However, the amendment to section 68 of the FIRS Act by the Finance Act 2021 has made it clear that FIRS is the only agency responsible for tax assessment, collection and enforcement.

"Breaking: Another fuel scarcity averted as NNPC, NUPENG, others reach truce","The Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) have suspended their planned strike after an intervention by the NNPC Ltd.

The parties also pledged collaboration on ensuring nationwide availability of petroleum products.

The suspension notice was made known in a communique following a critical stakeholders engagement between the NNPC Ltd., the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), PTD, NARTO, and NUPENG on Thursday, in Abuja.

The communique was jointly signed by Malam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Otunba Salmon Oladiti, National Chairman PTD , Mr Yusuf Otthman, NARTO President Comrade Williams Akporeha, NUPENG President and Abiodun Adeniji, Executive Director, Finance and Admin, NMDPRA.

NUPENG and PTD had planned to embark on strike following allegations that officials of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing were diverting the fund provided by NNPC Limited for the rehabilitation of 21 critical highways.

On Road Rehabilitation, the communique said NNPC provided updates on the current status of the road construction and rehabilitation projects under the road infrastructure tax credit scheme.

It said the NNPC assured the stakeholders that the funding earmarked for the 21 critical roads would be applied for the intended purpose only.

“To allay the fears of the stakeholders, NNPC and all parties commit to working together in the monitoring of the road projects,” it stated..

On review of freight rate for transporters, the communique noted that the stakeholders requested for completion of the ongoing discussion on the review of the freight rates to cover operational costs.

It noted that the stakeholders highlighted the precarious situation that truck owners faced in the light of current economic realities.

It further noted that the NMDPRA informed the meeting that a committee was constituted to review the rates which included PTD, NARTO and NUPENG in addition to other stakeholders.

It stated that all parties agreed to work expeditiously towards concluding the review of the freight rate and make recommendations to the Government.

According to the communique, the Authority is to advise on definite close-out date during the week of Feb. 21.

“The parties also agreed to foster collaboration on ensuring nationwide availability of petroleum products.

"Nigeria, Five Other African Countries To Begin Production Of Covid Vaccines – WHO","Nigeria and five other African countries have been chosen to begin production of COVID-19 vaccines, with the continent having had limited access to jabs.

“Today I’m delighted to announce the first six African countries that will receive technology from the hub to produce their own mRNA vaccines: Egypt, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, and Tunisia,” Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday.

According to the WHO, they were selected as the first recipients of technology from the organisation’s global mRNA vaccine hub, in a push to ensure the African continent can make its own jabs to fight COVID and other diseases.

“I was honoured to visit the Hub last week. And it’s already producing results, with Afrigen’s announcement that it has produced its own mRNA vaccine, based on publicly-available information about the composition of an existing vaccine,” Ghebreyesus said.

“We expect clinical trials to start in the 4th quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024. We expect the benefits of this initiative will extend far beyond #COVID19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria and tuberculosis”.

“WHO will work with the companies and the government in each country to develop a roadmap for training and production, based on their needs and capacities.

“Thank you all, and we look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success, for the healthier, safer and fairer Africa”.

According to the WHO boss, no other event like the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous.

He, therefore, stressed that the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need.

Tedros has continually called for equitable access to vaccines in order to beat the pandemic, and rails against the way wealthy nations have hogged doses, leaving Africa lagging behind other continents in the global vaccination effort.

A ceremony marking the mRNA tech transfer announcement was held Friday in Brussels at the summit between the European Union and the African Union.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said: “We have been talking a lot about producing mRNA vaccines in Africa. But this goes even beyond. This is mRNA technology designed in Africa, led by Africa and owned by Africa.”

Self-reliance

Currently, only one per cent of the vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent of some 1.3 billion people.

The WHO set up a global mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines.

The global hub’s role is to ensure that manufacturers in those nations have the know-how to make mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

As used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, mRNA technology provokes an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells.

Primarily set up to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the global hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other vaccines and products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.

The scheme’s ultimate goal is to spread capacity for national and regional production to all health technologies.

‘Mutual Respect’

The WHO said it would work with the first six countries chosen to develop a roadmap of training and support so they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.

Training will begin in March.

The South African hub is already producing mRNA vaccines at laboratory scale and is currently scaling up towards commercial scale.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday’s announcement “means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent”.

French President Emmanuel Macron said supporting African health sovereignty was one of the key goals of starting up local production, “to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time”.

More than 10.4 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, with nearly 62 percent of the global population having received at least one shot.

However, just 11.3 per cent of Africans had been fully immunised by the start of February.

In Nigeria, many are yet to be vaccinated despite efforts by authorities to make citizens get the jab.

On Thursday, the country recorded 45 new cases of the virus, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 254,182.

230,530 cases are, however, said to have recovered, while 3,141 deaths have been recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.

The 45 new cases were reported from eight states – Lagos (18), Cross River (7), FCT (7), Oyo (5), Kano (3), Nasarawa (3), Ekiti (1) and Rivers (1).

Across the world, the vaccine continues to rage on.

Here are some of the latest developments on the impact of the virus:

Japan eases strict border bar

Japan will ease its strict virus border rules to allow students and businesspeople into the country from March, but tourists will still be barred.

Portugal to lift most Covid rules

Portugal will no longer require people to present a health pass when going to restaurants and hotels, the government says, without providing a fixed date. Proof of vaccination is still necessary to enter the country.

Swiss president tests positive

On the day Switzerland lifts almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions, the government announces President Ignazio Cassis has tested positive.

Covid-19 pill

A South Africa regulator says it has approved the use of Merck’s Covid-19 pill for high-risk adults.

Canada Police Set to End Seige of Protesters Fighting Covid Measures,"Canadian police are poised to clear out on Friday hundreds of truck drivers from Ottawa who have staged a three-week-long protest against pandemic restrictions that has crippled the capital and prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assume emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years.

The drivers, joined by thousands of demonstrators and some 400 vehicles, turned the streets around Parliament into a noisy party zone since first arriving on Jan. 28, in what has become one of the worst crises to hit Trudeau since he took power in 2015. Police made a handful of arrests Thursday evening, including of Chris Barber, one of the main fundraisers and organizers, after authorities said action was imminent. Barber went without resistance after police told him he was being arrested for mischief. “We absolutely are committed to end this unlawful demonstration. We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,” interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday. Police will set up a perimeter with 100 checkpoints around downtown to stop people without legitimate reason from entering, he said.

“This weekend will look very different than the past three weekends,” he added. Previous chief Peter Sloly quit this week amid residents’ fury about what they saw as police inaction. The truckers’ protests started against vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, a measure in place in the United States, too. But slowly it spread across Canada and morphed into an anti-government movement. Protesters blocked several land crossings with the United States, including the busiest, the Ambassador Bridge which connects to Detroit, for six days, hurting both economies.

Calling the blockades a threat to democracy, Trudeau invoked emergency measures on Monday giving his government temporary powers to end the unrest. Government officials said they were worried about extremists causing violence.

“End the mandates, give us our rights and this is over,” said Chris Dacey on Thursday. “We’ll all go back to our families.” The border blockades turned the pressure on Trudeau to act swiftly, and U.S. President Joe Biden asked him to use federal powers. Many protesters on Parliament Hill said they would not leave until their demands were met. “The illegal blockades and occupations have to stop and the borders have to remain open,” Trudeau told legislators on Thursday as Parliament started debate on the Emergencies Act, which needs to be passed within seven days of an announcement.

But the official opposition Conservative Party says there was no need for the Emergencies Act, especially since the border blockades are over. Conservative Parliamentarian Jeremy Patzer told the House of Commons on Thursday that people around the world were alarmed to see Trudeau “come down on peaceful protesters with a sledgehammer.”","We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,” interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday.

"Mass Youth Migration to Europe Draining Africa’s Talent Pool, Buhari Laments","Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the mass migration of African youth to Europe, saying it drains the continent’s talent pool, while provoking political crises in Europe.

The president stated this in an article he penned to mark the participation of Nigeria at the ongoing 6th EU-AFRICA summit in Brussels, Belgium.

In the article published in Politico, an online/offline magazine which is the most influential publication for the EU/ in Brussels, Buhari noted that despite its best efforts, Europe would not find a sustainable remedy to this problem by further reinforcing its Fortress Europe approach.

According to him, instead, more opportunities must be created for Africans at home, providing alternatives to the decision to take a life-threatening boat journey in order to seek them elsewhere.

He advised that economic relationship between the two continents must be recalibrated to focus on job creation.

The president said, “By 2050, Africa’s population of 1.3 billion was set to double, making up a quarter of the world’s total. My country, Nigeria, is set to double its population to 400 million by then, surpassing the United States to become the third largest nation in the world.

“This means a huge youthful market right on Europe’s doorstep and — with increased trade a growing middle class with money to spend. However, despite burgeoning possibility, irregular northward migration from my continent drains Africa’s talent pool, while provoking political crises in the EU.

“When it comes to the relationship between the European Union and Africa, unfair arrangements have long been skated over for lack of alternatives.

“Increasingly unsustainable, these one-sided deals have provoked calls from both sides of the Mediterranean for a partnership of equals.

“At the EU-Africa Summit, leaders from across my continent will gather with their European counterparts to transform such rhetoric into substance. The EU is currently Africa’s largest trading partner, and Africa is the fastest growing continent on earth. While each presents the other with great opportunities, as partners, we also share a host of problems.

“Today, the EU-Africa relationship must be shifted toward a new economic arrangement in order to address them. The relationship between the EU and Africa must be rebalanced to power job creation. Unfortunately, today’s arrangements do just the opposite.

“Where some claim preferential trade policies with the EU lend a helping hand to Africa, the real picture is far more complicated. The Everything but Arms scheme grants 32 African countries tariff-free access to Europe’s protected markets. In addition to the fact that this excludes many of the continent’s 54 nations, there remain barriers to Europe’s markets even for countries that qualify.

“For example, though agricultural subsidies to EU farmers may not be the same as external tariffs, their effects are identical: They make Africa’s exports uncompetitive. More than €50 billion is ploughed into keeping European food produce cheap. “With its main export market distorted against them, African countries are deprived of foreign exchange, and investment in agriculture is stifled.

“Moving forward, it is clear what a new economic deal between our unions should entail: For Africa, it must offer a chance for a fundamentally new economic deal. For Europe, it must provide the chance to rid itself of a trade policy that quashes job-creation in Africa and hinders efforts to stem economic migration to Europe. The way forward is clear, the deal just needs to be struck.”

"Nigeria’s Economy Records 3.4% GDP Growth, Highest Since 2014","RelatedStories No Content Available

Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.40 per cent in 2021, the highest since 2014, when the economy grew by 6.22 per cent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) disclosed on Thursday.

According to the National GDP Q4 report released by the NBS, the expansion in economic activities was majorly driven by the non-oil sector.

The report also revealed that the country’s GDP grew by 3.98 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year (Q4 2021), lower than the 4.03 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter.

The performance indicated a sustained positive growth for five consecutive quarters since the recession witnessed in 2020, when output contracted by 6.10 per cent and 3.62 per cent respectively in the Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to report by the statistical agency, the economy was largely driven by the non-oil sector, which accounted for 94.81 per cent of GDP while the oil sector contributed 5.19 per cent to growth.

The Q4 growth indicated a steady economic recovery, accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 per cent in 2021. It noted that growth rate under the review period was higher than the 0.11 per cent recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87 percentage points and lower than 4.03 per cent recorded in Q3 by 0.05 percentage points.

The NBS, nevertheless, stated that quarter-on-quarter, real GDP grew at 9.63 per cent in Q4, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter.

The average daily oil production stood at 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd), lower than the 1.57mbpd in Q3 and 1.56 mbpd in Q4 2020.

Oil growth rate stood at -8.06 per cent in real terms in Q4 and annual growth rate of -8.30 per cent in 2021. On an annual basis, oil contributed 7.24 per cent compared to 8.16 per cent in 2020.

The non-oil sector, which excluded crude petroleum and natural gas activities, recorded a growth of 4.73 per cent in real terms, an improvement from the 1.69 per cent reported in Q4 2020.

The sector recorded an annual growth of 4.44 per cent compared to -1.25 per cent in 2020.

However, annual contribution of the non-oil sector increased to 92.76 per cent from 91.84 per cent in 2020.

The services sector contributed 55.11 per cent to the total growth while agriculture contributed 26.84 per cent to overall GDP in real terms in Q4, lower than 29.94 per cent in the preceding quarter and 26.95 per cent in Q4 2020.

The manufacturing sector contributed 8.46 per cent, lower than the 8.60 per cent lower than 8.96 per cent in Q3 and 8.98 per cent in Q4 2020.

In nominal terms, aggregate GDP stood at N49.28 trillion in Q4, higher than the N43.56 trillion in Q4 2020, and indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.11 per cent.

Nominal GDP in the preceding quarter of Q3 2021 stood at N45.11 trillion, while annual nominal value in 2021 was N173.53 trillion as compared to N152.32 trillion in 2020, indicating a growth rate of 13.92 per cent.

In terms of real GDP which shows the volume of economic activities, the sum of N20.33 trillion was recorded in Q4, higher than N18.54 trillion in the preceding quarter and also by N778.91 billion compared to N19.55 trillion recorded in Q4 2020.

The nominal GDP growth rate in Q4 was higher relative to 10.07 per cent growth recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020 but lower compared to 15.41 per cent growth recorded in the preceding quarter.

However, in 2021 annual nominal growth stood at 13.92 per cent.

According to the NBS, “The improvement being seen in the output growth in the last five quarters depicts a steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy.

“Globally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic. Thus, economic recovery is a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors.

“However, in Nigeria, the prospects of consolidating the recovery are glaring considering the improved economic performance over these periods of time.”

"‘14% women raped, 91% sexually harassed by bosses’","About 91 per cent of cases of sexual harassment in workplaces faced by women were being perpetrated by their bosses and superiors, research by a civil rights organization, HEIR Women Development Initiative, revealed.

HEIR Women Development is a social enterprise borne out of the need to see young women take on more decision-making positions, and venture into leadership opportunities.

The organisation also said that while three in four; 74 per cent of the women have experienced online stalking, 68 per cent attest to receiving persistent emails, sexual invitations, with 81 per cent confirming that this sexual harassment had been rife.

These were the findings of “Career barriers and workplace sexual harassment against young women in Nigeria: Research validation meeting and extract on the Federal Character Territory”, carried out by HEIR WDI with support from Ford Foundation.

The report of the research which was signed by the Programme Officer of HEIR Women Development, Blessing Ejeh, was obtained by Journalists in Abuja on Friday.

According to the research, while 14 per cent of the respondents revealed that “they have been raped at workplaces”, only 33 per cent of organizations were concerned about protecting women’s rights even as 68 per cent lacked gender responsiveness in their organizations.

The report said, “Three in five women; 57 per cent, have experienced physical sexual harassment which respondents reported in form of unwelcomed touching, deliberate pinching among others. 14 per cent of the respondents revealed that they have been raped at work. The major perpetrators of sexual harassment at work are seen to be bosses or superior, 91 per cent reported.

“Also, three in four; 74 per cent of these women have experienced online stalking while 68 per cent attest to receiving persistent emails, invitations sexual nature with 81 per cent confirming that this sexual harassment is being experienced often.”

The CSO said 68 per cent of the respondents reported a lack of gender responsiveness in their organization because the Human Resources Department is often charged with the responsibility of drafting protective policies on sexual harassment.

“However, their goal is to protect the interest of bosses to the detriment of other staff”, the report revealed.

The research said, “Despite these scary statistics, just 49 per cent of the respondents consider their workspace to be unsafe, which is a clear indication of the low awareness among these women of what sexual harassment entails and its dangers.”

Ejeh also shed light on how sexual harassment affects career development.

She said, “Sexual harassment has constituted a major limiting factor to women’s career journey at workplaces and participation in leadership for decades now. Therefore, this germane project seeks to identify with evidential data, the career barriers confronting young women with a lens into sexual harassment menace. Hence our theory of change is as follows- if young women are empowered with adequate tools to recognize and report sexual harassment at work, then organizations are encouraged to develop and ensure compliance with sexual harassment policies.

“Then, young women will have to be equipped to excel in their career and leadership aspirations. 51 per cent of the respondents reported that they have been sexually harassed at their workplace. 39 per cent of the respondents revealed that there were no systems, laws, policies to protect them at their workplaces while 35 per cent revealed that although “Therefore, it is believed that laws on sexual harassment are non-existence as this is clearly shown in the fact that the labour law made no provision on sexual harassment at workplaces.”

"Osinbajo, Makinde eulogise Alao-Akala as ex-gov buried in Ogbomoso","Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Friday led prominent Nigerians to pay their last respect to former governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, who was buried at his residence in Ogbomoso.

Governors and other politicians from the two leasing political parties on the country, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party stormed Beulah Baptist Church, Ogbomoso where the funeral service was held in honour of the former governor before his remains were buried at his residence.

Alao-Akala, who won election on the platform of the PDP in 2007 to become Oyo State governor eventually dumped the party and was the leader of the APC in Oyo State when he died on January 12.

Apart from the Vice President, the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigerian Governors’ Forum; Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde; his deputy, Rauf Olaniyan; Ogun State Deputy Governor, Noimot Oyedele Salako, attended the service.

Former governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola; former governor Ibikule Amosun and the Deputy National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Ambassador Taofek Arapaja among others were also present at the ceremony.

The Vice President Yemi Osinbajo described Alao-Akala as an open-minded politician, who would be missed for his magnanimity and compassion.

He said the late governor served the interest of his people when he was in power and gave quality counsel to those who were around him.

Osinbajo said the late politician in his lifetime as the governor was an accountable personality who improved the Internationally Generated Revenue of the state from N300 million to N1billion.

Osinbajo also described Alao-Akala as a very responsible and respectful to the views of individuals.

He said the late politician would be missed for his counsel and compassion.

Osinbajo said, “Everywhere Alao-Akala went in his days as governor, you would hear the chant of ‘Oyato’. Of course, he really did many things differently in office.

“He significantly improved the IGR of the state from a paltry N300m to N1bn in eight months and put in place very good security architecture.

“Alao-Akala practically demonstrated what is possible when you have creativity and compassion. Since his transition in January, I have read several glowing tributes to his memory and the common refrain running through all of those tributes has been the attestation to his uncommon generosity.

“He was indeed a simple and humane man, who practised politics with an open mind. Many testified that his resources were available to all and his home was there for anyone to come for help.”

Makinde, who declared that the state government would immortalise the late former governor, said a committee headed by his Chief of Staff, Hon. Segun Ogunwuyi, has been put in place to work on how best to honour the late Chief Alao-Akala.

He said, “As for the children who came with a request, I know how you feel and I will champion the cause to redeem whatever it is the late governor Alao-Akala has promised them.

“Finally, I have been going around determining how we can honour our great man from Oyo State. We have set up a committee headed by the Chief of Staff. If you also have any advice in this regard, let us know and, within the shortest period of time, the government of Oyo State will ensure that he is adequately honoured.

“On that note, I want to say farewell to a great man, my brother, my mentor and a great son of Ogbomosoland.”

A’Ibom first Lady cautions against out-of-court settlement for rape cases,"By Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo

The Akwa Ibom State First Lady, Dr Martha Udom Emmanuel, has advised the state police command not to encourage granting of bail and out-of-court settlement for rape cases.

Dr Emmanuel who gave the advice yesterday when she paid a courtesy visit on the State Commissioner of police, Mr Andrew Amiengheme, stressed that all rape cases should be channeled to the family unit and not to be settled out of Court.

She also urged the police command to refrain from harassing and demanding money from victims of Gender- Based Violence, (GBV) before their cases are attended to, as such scares the victims from going to the police to lodge their complaints.

The first Lady who was accompanied by the GBV management committee, also noted that demanding money from already wounded and traumatized victims was an act of insensitivity.

Her words: “We are here to officially tell you that we want to work with you and we want you to work with us. I’m saying this because there are some police stations in some local governments that are not friendly.

“I want you sir to have meeting with them and address this issue. We’ve been fighting this menace over the years now, especially cases of rape that has been on the high side. So far the police most time have cooperated with us.

“They should not be demanding from somebody that is already wounded, adding salt into injury. Also, settlement of rape cases and granting of bails should not be encouraged. When they do that, these people will go out there and be bragging.

“And it takes the intervention of another policeman to re-arrest them. It shouldn’t be like that. We should follow one guideline. The officers should empathize with the victims and give them succour”

The first lady also frowned at the situation where some police officers blame GBV victims by attributing the women’s woes to either their way of dressing and bad attitude at home.

Responding, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Andrew Amiengheme thanked the First Lady and her team for the visit, and reassured them that offenders would be made to face the law.

The CP, however, noted that most rape victims were reluctant to come forward to pursue their cases when they are offered money, and blamed the development on the high level of poverty.

“I want o assure you that since I came I’ve ensured that any GBV case is settled in no other place than the court. Some people go as far as petitioning the AIG. The AIG does not interfere in such matters of GBV, but he will tell you, make sure it goes to court.” The CP noted.","By Chioma Onuegbu, UyoThe Akwa Ibom State First Lady, Dr Martha Udom Emmanuel, has advised the state police command not to encourage granting of bail and out-of-court settlement for rape cases.

Scammers target hotel customers in Lagos,"By David Royal

The management of a Lagos hotel has raised the alarm on how scammers are targeting customers by deceiving them into paying money into a private bank account belonging to the scammers instead of the hotel’s approved bank account for bookings.

This allegation was made by the management of Integrity Hotels & Suites situated at Abagbon close, Victoria Island, Lagos, noting that it uncovered plans by the scammers to swindle money from more of its customers.



Some customers had complained that they were involved in series of unfulfilled hotel room bookings online without getting values after making payments into an individual’s account, who claimed to be the manager of the hotel.



The hotel said it gathered that the scammers offered hotel room bookings on an online platform, but buyers purportedly did not receive their bookings after making payment.

Posing as the hotel managers, the scammers have diverted thousands of money into their bank accounts, a practice they began last year.

One of the staff members of the hotel, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “We got complaints from customers that they made payment to the bank accounts of some people they contacted through a number displayed on the hotel site.



“They have an online platform and they include their contact number alongside our hotel’s name and address, making unsuspecting customers believe that they are the management of our hotel. We don’t really know how much has been lost but we have been receiving calls from different customers reporting these scammers.”



He further appealed to the public to disregard or report anyone online posing as a staff of Integrity Hotels & Suites.

Vanguard News Nigeria","By David RoyalThe management of a Lagos hotel has raised the alarm on how scammers are targeting customers by deceiving them into paying money into a private bank account belonging to the scammers instead of the hotel’s approved bank account for bookings.
This allegation was made by the management of Integrity Hotels & Suites situated at Abagbon close, Victoria Island, Lagos, noting that it uncovered plans by the scammers to swindle money from more of its customers.
Some customers had complained that they were involved in series of unfulfilled hotel room bookings online without getting values after making payments into an individual’s account, who claimed to be the manager of the hotel.
The hotel said it gathered that the scammers offered hotel room bookings on an online platform, but buyers purportedly did not receive their bookings after making payment.

"Again, gunmen attack Okomu oil palm plantation in Edo","Gunmen yesterday again attacked the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s plantation in Ovia Southwest Local Government Area of Edo State, a day after two suspects were paraded by the state’s police command on their involvement in the February 1 this year’s attack.

The sudden attack by the suspected criminals led to the death of two staff of Okomu company and the burning of 90 hectares of rubber plantation and three excavators.

Okomu oil palm company’s Communication Officer, Fidelis Olise, yesterday in Benin, disclosed that the gunmen also carried out an attack at the plantation on Tuesday, thereby making it two attacks in three days.

Olise noted that the gunmen, whom he described as terrorists, carried out the latest attack, in retaliation for the arrest of two of their supposed members.

He said: “The same terrorists, seemingly angered by the arrest of two of their supposed members, carried out further attacks on innocent workers on the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s property, to avenge the arrest of their accomplices, who apparently confessed to the theft of rubber lumps.

“The suspected thieves were arrested by the marine police in a boat, after it had left Okomu Ijaw community, on its way to neighbouring Delta State.

“Killing of innocent workers of Okomu company, who are performing their legitimate duties, and have no conflict or disagreement with any person, is strongly condemned. The powers that be should immediately take action against the terrorists responsible for the murderous crimes.

“Attacks on companies like Okomu call for concern, as terrorists are now focusing on such establishments, intent on bringing them to their knees, and in so doing create an impression that the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led government is weak. The attacks also pose great threat to the current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administrations.”

Okomu’s communication officer also stated that the time had come for the Obaseki and Buhari’s administrations to take decisive actions against the terrorists, declaring that otherwise, investments in the agricultural sector would be greatly affected, as it was the case with pipeline vandalism in the past, with the resultant negative effects on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both the state and federal government’s coffers.

He urged the police to thoroughly investigate the incessant attacks on the company’s facilities and bring the perpetrators to book, in order to serve as a deterrent to others.

Olise admonished the authorities of the military, especially the Nigerian Army and Navy, to deploy their personnel in the area, in order to ensure adequate security for residents of Ovia Southwest LGA, their property and investments, with the terrorists and cultists to be dislodged from the area.

It will be recalled that police in Edo state on Thursday at Gelegele near Benin in Ovia Northeast LGA of Edo, paraded two arrested men: Destiny Tibhor, 22, and Lucky Clark, 52, for invading Okomu oil palm company, and stealing rubber lumps belonging to the firm, while they were apprehended on February 15.

The suspected criminals were paraded by the state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Bello Kontongs, a Superintendent of Police (SP), who noted that Edo Police Commissioner, Phillip Ogbadu, facilitated the arrests, in an attempt to unravel the persons behind the attacks.

Kontongs revealed that the marine police component, led by Courage Ogonmwan, SP, while on patrol in the area, intercepted the suspects on Okomu waterway, while adding that further investigation would determine whether the two suspects were among the criminals who were involved in the attacks on Okomu oil palm plantation or not.","Gunmen yesterday again attacked the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s plantation in Ovia Southwest Local Government Area of Edo State, a day after two suspects were paraded by the state’s police command on their involvement in the February 1 this year’s attack.

Minister to INEC: Improve on faulty BVAS machine,"Following the outcomes of the just-concluded area council elections, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to as a matter of urgency improve on the functionality of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS).

The minister gave the charge at the presentation of the certificate of returns to the newly elected chairmen and councilors of the area council elections held on February 12, 2022.

Aliyu stressed that in the course of monitoring the voting process it was observed that the process was slow at several polling units owing to faulty BVAS machines.

The minister, therefore, tasked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to as a matter of urgency look into BVAS machines malfunctioning or in the alternative allow electorate accredited to vote manually as the nation approaches general elections.

According to a statement issued on Friday by her Special Assistant, Media, Austine Elemue, the minister said: “Today is another remarkable day in the history of FCT as we have successfully conducted one of the most peaceful elections in the third tier of government in Nigeria.

“The elections have been won and lost, but today’s event is for the presentation of certificates of return to the newly elected chairmen of the six area councils and councilors of the 62 wards of FCT. It is worthy to note that the FCT Administration does not in any way interfere with the conduct of the elections. This alone entails transparency.

“However in the course of monitoring the election process in the six area councils the voting process was slow at several polling units because the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) machine was faulty or malfunctioning.

“The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should as a matter of urgency look into BVAS machine malfunctioning or in the alternative allow electorate accredited to vote manually. I did not say cancel the BVAS, because I am not a contestant in any way here.”","Following the outcomes of the just-concluded area council elections, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to as a matter of urgency improve on the functionality of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS).

"FG reforms to meet demand for additional 15,262Mw","Concerned about how to bridge the gap between the National Peak Demand Forecast of 19,788Mega Watts (MW) and the Peak Generation of 16th February, 2022, the Federal Government has sought to attain a financially healthy and technically robust Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI).

Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) Plc, Managing Director, Dr. Nneaemeka Ewelukwa disclosed at the weekend during the capacity building workshop for members of Power Correspondents Association (PCAN) and Civil Society Organization in Lagos.

The theme of the workshop was ‘Building knowledge and plugging skills gap in power sector reporting.’

He said, “this mismatch is worrying the government that wants it to match.”

Ewelukwa added that the government’s plan is to keep expanding generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the country’s demand.

Noting that the electricity market is a question of ability and willingness to pay for supplied power, he said that it will be critical to ensure that the electricity that will flow in the system is procured.

He insisted that the loan which the Federal Government is investing in the sector must be repaid through payment for consumed energy.

According to him, the distribution companies are improving their performance and facilities to bring the 15,262MW.

On how to bridge the gap, he said: “For you to bridge the gap between Peak Demand and Peak Generation, it speaks to these market reforms because two things need to happen.

“The system must have the ability to physically move that power. Two, if the system can move that additional power and GenCos are to bring that additional power.

“It must be paid for. So, it brings us back to the point I made about a sector that is financially healthy and technically robust.”

He said that the critical reforms that the government has embarked on are designed to ensure the financial health of the market and technical capacity to remove the deficit in supply to meet the demand of the country.

According to him, the government has begun the implementation of the transmission expansion plan which works in sync with the FGN/Simens Presidential Power Initiative with phase one 7,000mw, phase two 11,000Mw and phase three 25,000MW supply.

Asked to state the timeline for bridging the Gap, Ewelukwa revealed that “because this government is keen to implement these reforms, to be honest with you, we are having sleepless nights to achieve these. They are milestones. They are targets.”

He recalled that at inception, the NBET took over the Power Purchase Agreements that the defunct Power Holding Company (PHCN) signed with Agip, which had a gas component.

Ewelukwa noted that this is accountable for while the company is involved in the transaction for supplying gas to the Calabar Generation Company.

He explained that NBET’s function in a Transition Electricity Based Market is characterized by a market-based agreement for electricity trading.

Ewelukwa noted that the NBET is designed to be a temporary bridge in the electricity market.

NBET, he said, has a long term role to drive market competition by ensuring that it is moved from a government centres market to a private sector-driven electricity market.

Continuing, he vowed that going forward: “We no longer need to buy power as a central procurer of electricity rather the power we have purchased we will stand the process of handing it over to the DisCos and the GenCos so that the DisCos can now say I want to buy power directly from GenCos.

“We are enthusiastically looking at the point when we will actually start the innovation process of handing over the PPAs we signed to distribution licensees and eligible customers as the case may be.”","On how to bridge the gap, he said: “For you to bridge the gap between Peak Demand and Peak Generation, it speaks to these market reforms because two things need to happen.

Economy: PDP not qualified to cast aspersion – APC,"The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lacks the locus to cast aspersions on the economic growth recorded by the Federal Government.

The governing party maintained that the sustained growth of the country’s economy was not a fluke, but the result of deliberate policies of President Muhammadu Buhari led administration

Faulting the opposition, APC accused the opposition of being solely responsible for the country’s economic woes.

Secretary to the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe in a reaction to PDP outburst to the 4th-Quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which reflected 3.4 per cent growth in 2021 and the strongest since 2014, said the APC has been repairing the mess left by the 16 years of misrule of PDP.

He noted: “As reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its 4th-Quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report, Nigeria’s economy grew 3.4% in 2021, the strongest since 2014 and showed sustained positive growth for the 5th quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020.

- Advertisement -

“The country’s economy grew faster than forecast by the Central Bank and government last year after an expansion in the agriculture and trade industries in the fourth quarter offset a sharp drop in oil production.

“The question begging for answers is the reason behind the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) pessimism and gloom over the NBS Report. Against the backdrop of the opposition Party’s doomsday wishes for the country, deflated PDP says the NBS Report is fake.

“It is clear that the PDP is still stuck on the voodoo economics it used to hide stealing and the shocking mismanagement of the economy under its watch until Nigerians voted the PDP out in favour of the APC government to restore sanity in the economy and other sectors of our national life.”

The ruling party then joined other well-meaning Nigerians to celebrate the many positives of the country’s sustained economic growth which consolidates our rank as Africa’s largest economy.

Akpanudoedehe maintained, “Our economic growth is not mere happenstance, but as a result of deliberate programmes and policies of the President Muhammadu Buhari government to reflate, diversify and grow the economy from its former shoddy state.

“As a direct result of this government’s non-oil sector economic diversification drive, agriculture; trade; Information and Communications Technology; and Financial and Insurance Institutions, accounted for positive GDP growth, as reported by the NBS.

“Significantly, the non-oil sector grew by 4.73%, contributing 94.81% to the nation’s GDP in the fourth quarter 2021.”

The party drew the attention of PDP to Thursday’s report of Nigeria’s second peer review by the AU-NEPAD which noted thus: “…tremendous progress and success have been made in many areas, particularly in infrastructure development, agricultural revolution, humanitarian services, fight against corruption and so many more for which Nigeria was highly commended by the forum of Heads of State and Government at the 31st Ordinary Session of the AU on the 4th of February, 2022.”

APC then enjoined “the PDP not to be the enemy within as it laboriously tries to in the guise of opposition politics. Besides, the fact that PDP governments are solely responsible for Nigeria’s economic mess which the APC government is repairing leaves the PDP least qualified to cast aspersions on the economic growth being recorded.

“All well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders should support this government to consolidate on our economic wins and efforts to entrench good governance practices which ultimately translates to transparency, accountability and an enabling environment for sustainable development. Nigerians will be the ultimate beneficiaries.”","The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lacks the locus to cast aspersions on the economic growth recorded by the Federal Government.

Anambra accident: Police react as truck drivers block Onitsha-Owerri road,"The Anambra State Police Command on Saturday reacted to the fatal accident which occurred at a police checkpoint on the Onitsha-Owerri Road, Ihiala Local Government of the state.

The accident occurred when a truck with number plate UWZ556XA, rammed into six other vehicles around Ken Maduako Oil and Gas Filling Station along the Ihialla-Onitsha road area of the state, killing two persons and injuring nine others on Friday.

It was gathered that the truck driver, who was on a top speed, while approaching the police checkpoint at Ihiala, lost control and rammed into the vehicles on the queue at the checkpoint and crashed.

No fewer than 63 persons were involved in the crash as it also involved commercial vehicles. Some motorists escaped unhurt.

It was gathered that the accident created some pandemonium around the scene as members of the truck drivers union blocked the busy Onitsha-Owerri Road, on noticing that the accident was a result of the police checkpoint in the area.

The truck drivers mobilised heavy trucks around the scene of the accident and blocked the ever busy highway on both sides, an action, which caused heavy gridlock on that road.

The real reason for their actions was not provided, but eyewitnesses said they were protesting the havoc the police checkpoint is causing motorists on that road, as a similar event had occurred a few months ago on that axis.

The eyewitness lamented that motorists are always being asked to come down from their vehicles to trek past the police checkpoint, an action that has become a burden to the motoring public.

However, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echeng, had commiserated with the families of the two persons who died and the nine others, who sustained injuries in the accident.

In a statement on Saturday, the police spokesman, DCP Ikenga Tochukwu, identified the driver of the truck as one of the victims that died in the crash while attributing the fatal crash to overspeeding and brake failure by the trailer driver.

The police said the truck drivers were misinformed about the cause of the accident, which led to their protest while appealing to them to have a rethink.

The statement read in part, “While the Police indeed have a ‘Stop and Search Point’ close to the scene of the accident, it is wrong to blame the police for the unfortunate incident.

“The fact that only six vehicles were on the queue on a dual carriageway as busy as that expressway is evidence that the Police has been responsible and sensitive to the plight of the motoring public by ensuring minimal delay as it conduct its stop and search operations aimed at protecting not only Police facilities in the area from insurgents’ attacks, but also the general public, who are mostly at the receiving end of escapades by criminal elements.”

The police boss, however, commended the officers of the Federal Road Safety Corps for promptly rising to the occasion and partnering with them in getting the injured to the hospital and clearing the wreckage from the road to allow for free flow of traffic.

“It is unfortunate that drivers of container bearing trailers, under the umbrella of their union, who were misinformed about the cause of the accident mobilised heavy trucks to the scene at about 1630 hours on the day of the accident and blocked the ever busy highway on both sides.

“All entreaties made to them to consider the plight of the motoring public fell on deaf ears. Innocent motorists were at the receiving end of this ill-advised blockade.

“The Nigeria Police wish to appeal to the unionists to have a rethink in the interest of their fellow citizens and consider the plight of stranded travellers to remove the blockade from the highway. The Police will continue to explore peaceful means of resolving the imbroglio to prevent further loss of precious human lives,” the statement added.

It also added that the CP, while thanking the good public for their robust support, assured them that the Police would continue to raise the bar of service delivery in the interest and safety of the law-abiding public.

Anambra retired teachers lament unpaid four-year gratuities,"The retired teachers in Anambra State have protested the nonpayment of their gratuities by the state government for four years.

They, therefore, asked Governor Willie Obiano to pay the backlog of their gratuities which had accrued since 2017 before leaving office in March.

The angry retirees protested along the Teachers’ House Road, Awka, on Friday, carrying placards with various inscriptions.

Some of the placards read, “Obiano, pay us our pension and gratuity in line with the approved structure,” “Give us our arrears of pension,” “Our gratuities are our rights,” “Pay us now that we are alive,” and “Is it when we die that others will collect what we worked for?”

The spokesperson of the group, Mrs Victoria Maduka, who retired as a Zonal Director in 2018 from Ogidi zone, explained that many of them, including those who retired in 2017, were yet to receive any payment from the government having served for thirty-five years.

Maduka expressed regret that the situation had adversely affected them, as they struggled to eat, pay hospital and electricity bills as well as house rents and children’s school fees.

She said that it was unfortunate that despite the letter they wrote to the government three weeks ago, no response had been given to them as regards what was delaying their gratuities in the last four years.

According to her, though the tenure of the present administration would end in less than one month, they believed their emoluments could still be paid considering the efforts and sacrifices they had put in moving the state forward.

Another retiree, Mr. Raymond Achebe, while narrating the impact of the long denial of their monies on their families, appealed to the government to consider their plights and pay them.

The teachers lamented that they recently buried a deputy director, who died while waiting for the state government to pay her emoluments after 35 years of service.

"Ex-militant leader, Akpodoro, elected Mayor of Urhoboland",".

An ex-militant leader and Head of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, NCNDE-A, Eshanekpe Israel, a.k.a Akpodoro has been elected the Mayor of Urhoboland by Gbaregolor Federated Communities led by Chief Edemini Epiagbaga the Okpako-Orere of the Gbaregolor Federation.

This was made known by the Okpako Orere-in-Council during a well-attended event in the ancient community of Gberegolor, Ughelli South Local Government Area of the oil-rich Delta State, South-South Nigeria.

In his address during the ceremony with the President-Generals of seven other communities in attendance, the Okapko Orere reeled out the achievements of the former warrior to include his dedication to the growth and development of Urhobo land in particular and Nigeria in general noting that His Excellency, Akpodoro brought pride to Urhobo nation, particularly during the disarmament of reluctant militants who weren’t willing to disengage from militancy at the dawn of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, in the Niger Delta region.

Chief Epiagbaga noted that Akpodoro was he who in conjunction with the Nigerian armed forces averted what would have been a bloody war in the Niger Delta during the renewed insurgency in the region in 2016. He said the new Mayor of Urhobo Land was he who tamed rather than supported the Avengers in their onslaught against the economic wellbeing of the nation.

Akpodoro, he noted deserves all the honours and privileges in Urhobo Land owing to his unwavering belief in the Urhobo project noting that the Mayor remains the only Urhobo Youth who can hold his own anywhere in the world without let or hindrance and on account of this labyrinth of achievements, he conferred on Akpodoro, who is the National Taskforce Chairman, of the Association of Nigerian Refineries and Petroleum Marketers, ANRPM the Mayoral honour.

“In recognition of your outstanding and excellent distortions to the development and growth of Urhoboland, you are awarded the Mayor and we hope you take Urhobo nation to the highest level. We believe in you,” the Okpako Orere stated.

In appreciation to the leadership and the people of the Federated Communities, Akpodoro said he was humbled by the honour done him saying it was a great privilege and higher call to serve Urhobo land and the entire nation saying the struggle for a greater Urhobo people is his life as he called for unity of purpose, peace in Urhoboland noting that only a peaceful people can be developed.","An ex-militant leader and Head of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, NCNDE-A, Eshanekpe Israel, a.k.a Akpodoro has been elected the Mayor of Urhoboland by Gbaregolor Federated Communities led by Chief Edemini Epiagbaga the Okpako-Orere of the Gbaregolor Federation.

DELTA 2023: Anioma Traditional Rulers back senatorial zoning,".

.. say status quo should be maintained

..as DC-23 visits, lobby Delta North Monarchs

By Festus Ahon, ASABA

AS the struggle for which senatorial district should produce the next Governor of the State ranges on, Delta North Traditional Rulers Forum, Friday, insisted on senatorial zoning arrangement, arguing that zoning based on ethnicity was not tenable.

Chairman of the Forum, Obi (Prof) Chike Edozien who disclosed this when the Delta Central Senatorial District, DC-23 led by Senator Ighoyota Amori paid a consultative visit to Anioma traditional rulers, said the status quo of the zoning arrangement put in place in the days of former Governor James Ibori should be maintained.

Edozien who was joined by over 35 Delta North Traditional Rulers in his Palace to receive the DC-23 delegates, said: “Delta State is for everybody and as traditional rulers, we preach peace because we want peace to reign. When there is peace, there will be progress.

“We all know very well the position of Delta State in the nation’s economy. Therefore, Delta State cannot afford to make mistakes, we can’t afford to have peace because anything that disturbs Delta State peace is going to affect the whole country.

“This is our State, we don’t have any other place to relocate to; we want peace in Delta State. The Governorship zoning system that has been working for us is on senatorial basis. The central has gone, which is Chief James Ibori, Delta South has gone, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan and today our son, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa is on the saddle.

“When we were going round to canvass for support in 2015 for Delta North, our campaign was based on senatorial district. Today Delta North, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa is now the Governor, which by God’s grace his tenure will end in a year time.

“For somebody from Delta North to say he wants to be governor after Senator Ifeanyi Okowa is wrong, not that the person does not have the constitutional right, but is going to be a fruitless effort because the person will end up wasting his money. We Delta Northerners know that is our son that is occupying that position now.

“In Anioma Congress, we have the political class, we have the traditional rulers class and the business class. Our political class and business class have not come to us the traditional rulers to say there is a change in the zoning pattern. Even our son, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has not come to us to say there is a different arrangement apart from the senatorial zoning which we have been using.

“Since they have not come to us to say otherwise, the status quo remains, which means the senatorial district zoning arrangement is what we will still maintain. I, therefore, call on Urhobo people, which is Delta Central to be steadfast and put their house together.

“I congratulate DC-23 for being able to prune the aspirants to three. Any of these persons, Olorogun David Edevbie, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi and Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori are all qualified to be Governor. I have known these three persons very well.”

Earlier in his remarks, National Chairman of DC-23, Senator Ighoyota Amori solicited the support of the Delta North Traditional Rulers, arguing that it was the turn of the Delta Central Senatorial District to produce the next Governor.

Amori said Delta Central have waited for 16 years, adding that it was only proper to allow them to come in after Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.

He maintained that zoning along ethnic nationality was not practicable, saying that the state was made up of seven ethnic groups.

Jafaru Mohammed: EFCC denies its official stole N10.9bn from NIA funds found in Ikoyi,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied the “theft” of N10.9 billion belonging to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) by its official.

On April 12, 2017, the EFCC uncovered about $43.5 million, £27,800 and N23.2 million inside Apartment 7B, Osborne Towers in Ikoyi, Lagos.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo chaired a presidential investigation committee that grilled the sacked NIA DG, Ayo Oke, ex-EFCC chairman Ibrahim Magu, among others.

A Brigadier General, Jafaru Mohammed, is accused of stealing a chunk of the money to purchase properties now forfeited to the Federal Government.

Mohammed is currently the Director of Finance and Administration, Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA).

In 2017, the senior officer was appointed by Magu to oversee the N13 billion found in Ikoyi. The EFCC was then in charge of NIA bank accounts.

In a statement at the weekend, EFCC Head of Media, Wilson Uwujaren said Mohammed was not its staff.

The spokesman noted that the claim was false and intended to mislead the public.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC has no accountant by name, Jafaru Mohammed and could not have appointed him to serve in another agency.

“It is infantile to suggest that the Commission would appoint an accountant for the National Intelligence Agency, NIA, which is not a department of the EFCC.”

After Abdulrasheed Bawa assumed office last year, the EFCC secured an interim forfeiture order on assets linked to Mohammed.

In March 2021, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo of the Federal High Court in Abuja, in suit FHC/ABJ/CS/007/2021, directed the seal of the properties.

A House on Plot 7, God’s Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; a plot at Kubwa Express, opposite Abuja Model City Gate; a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.

Others are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.

On February 14, 2022, Justice N. E. Maha of the Federal High Court in Abuja granted final forfeiture after an application by EFCC lawyers, Cosmos Ugwu and Musa Isah.

Additional properties seized include a Truck Assembly at Ring Road, adjacent to A A Affa Filling Station, Kano; Marhaba Event Place, Guda Abdullahi Road, Kano.

A plot located at Rake, adjacent to Dara Orthopedic Hospital, Kano; 117 hectares of land at Adiabo, Oduapani LG, Calabar, with Certificated of Occupancy No. OD/23/2011 dated 21/2/ 2011.

Announcing the court ruling, the EFCC concealed Mohammed’s name but mentioned his accomplices.

The proxies include the late General Maude Aminun-Kano, Atlasfield Integrated Services Nigeria Limited, Marhaba Events Place, Aflac Plastics and Atlasfield Gas Plant Limited.

In August 2017, the citizens that provided intelligence on the NIA funds petitioned the Attorney General and Justice Minister, Abubakar Malami.

The claimants, through their solicitors, accused the EFCC of failing to pay their whistleblower commission.","The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied the “theft” of N10.9 billion belonging to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) by its official.

Army charges officers to stick to virtue of loyalty as 295 cadets pass out,"The Nigeria Army has charged the 295 cadets of Short Service Course (SSC) 47 to uphold the symbol of loyalty as they are posted to their respective places of assignment.

Major General Anthony Omozoje, Chief of Policy and Plans Nigerian Army, gave the charge during the dinner in honour of 295 cadets of short service officers from the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna.

According to him, the academy has provided them with an adequate training that would enable them to discharge their duties effectively, as all eyes are on them to prove their worth to the service of their fatherland.

He said as officers, they should be loyal to their superior and refrain from any form of criminality, adding that anyone found wanting will be shown the way out.

“They must be loyal to the service, they must remain loyal to this nation. They should be committed to their assignment, that is what is required,” he said.

He added that it’s only when they stay committed to their duties, they would get to the peak of their careers, adding that Nigerians await to see officers who demonstrate good character, defend the nation and work assiduously to ensure the protection of lives and property.

He further informed them that in a few days, they will end a phase and begin another as transition from being cadets to commissioned officers of the Nigerian Army.

Omozoje noted that officers are essential to the army organization to command, establish policy and manage resources while balancing risk and caring for the people and families, adding that they need a correct sense of responsibility, coupled with the right knowledge.

He told them to submit to civil requirements for leadership development that will enable them to contribute to the development and effectiveness of the Nigerian Army in accomplishing tasks in support of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the constitution.

“Hence, you must be leaders who are physically and mentally fit, highly motivated and disciplined, willing to share in the hardship, danger and inspire your men to follow you even into the darkest of places,” he said.","The Nigeria Army has charged the 295 cadets of Short Service Course (SSC) 47 to uphold the symbol of loyalty as they are posted to their respective places of assignment.

"Nwoba: Saraki wants PDP spokesman released, blasts Ebonyi govt, Ebube Agu","Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged the police to release Chika Nwoba, Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State.

Saraki also lambasted the Governor Dave Umahi-led government, noting that “act of injustice” is being “promoted and foisted by those in power in Ebonyi.”

A statement by his media office at the weekend decried the spokesman’s arrest for “circulating false information.”

Saraki condemned the brutality by Ebube Agu, the security outfit which picked Nwoba before the intervention of the police.

A situation where a citizen was suddenly seized, beaten to a stupor and detained for several weeks, “is an assault on democracy”, he said.

The former Kwara State Governor expressed disappointment that injustice has transcended every facet of the country.

Insisting Nwoba deserves the right to fair hearing, Saraki said he has been controversially remanded after an arrest which started like a kidnap.

“He has been prevented from meeting any member of his family. My sympathy goes out to his wife and kids who must be going through a tough time at the moment.

“Mr Nwoba is a dutiful member of our great party, PDP, and he is paying the price of speaking truth to power.

“Without any doubt, this is another concerted effort to silence the opposition and undermine democracy.

“This act of injustice being promoted and foisted by those in power in Ebonyi, is nothing but an assault on our democracy and our freedom as citizens because an injury to one is an injury to all.

“This is a time for every well meaning Nigerian and most especially the leaders of our party, the PDP, to stand up and stand with one of our own.”

Saraki told the public that Nigeria must be saved from the misfortune wreaked by injustice and miscarriage of justice.

The former SP added that with the case in a Magistrate court, he hopes justice will be dispensed promptly and without any delay.

In late January, the PDP accused Umahi of unleashing terror on its members and other dissenting voices.

Umahi “is using a heavily armed killer squad, disguising under the Ebube Agu security outfit, as a political weapon”, said National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.","Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged the police to release Chika Nwoba, Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State.

CSOs mobilise for national protest over delay in assenting to Electoral Act Amendment Bill,"The continuous delay by President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is brewing a social crisis, as a coalition of civil society organisations has fixed February 22nd to stage a national protest.

No fewer than 26 Civil Society Organisations are currently mobilising for the protest, DAILY POST has learnt.

The move according to them is intended to mount further pressure on the presidency to do the needful and sign the amended bill into law.

Some of the prominent CSOs spoiling for a protest are Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre, Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organizations (NNNGO) among others.

Their concerns stem from insinuations that the delay in granting presidential assent to the Electoral Bill, 2022 may create legal uncertainties that will threaten the integrity of the off-cycle elections in Ekiti, Osun, including the 2023 general election, which is only 366 days away.

They are amazed why the President, despite giving assurance that he would sign once the direct primary clause is expunged from the Bill, is still withholding his assent even after the National Assembly has complied with his directive.

They took to a statement on Saturday to state their grievances, saying, “aware that on the 31st January 2022, the National Assembly transmitted the Electoral Bill 2022 to the President for assent after expeditiously reworking the bill to meet the President’s expectations. Also, aware the bill allows electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC’s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.

“Further aware, the bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.

“The civil society community resolves to declare Tuesday, 22nd February 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill. Civil society networks will organize peaceful public direct-action activities to further the demand to assent the bill.

“We urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance”.","The continuous delay by President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is brewing a social crisis, as a coalition of civil society organisations has fixed February 22nd to stage a national protest.

APC primary: Aregbesola tells members to move against violence,"Minister of Interior Ogbeno Rauf Aregbesola has appelaed to members of the All Progressives Congress(APC) to prevent violence and thuggery in the ongoing governorship primary.

He specifically told women to lead the voting process to prevent attacks by thugs during the exercise.

Aregbesola, who has mounted stiff opposition to the second term bid of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, in a statement he personally signed, appealed to members of the party to conduct themselves peacefully.

According to him: “This electoral cycle is a two-staged process. The first is intra-party, meaning that our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), will democratically nominate its candidate. The second stage, inter-party, will take place in a state-wide election sometime in July, God willing.

“I am appealing to all our party members to participate but peacefully in the primary election taking place today. They should avoid any form of violence, brigandage and disorderliness.

“Our party members, especially our supporters, should be resolute to cast their vote, not to be intimidated and scared away.

“But they should portray themselves and the party in the best form in comportment, organisation and promotion of societal peace and tranquillity.

“I am also appealing to our members to push out the women and let them lead the process by coming out decently and peacefully.

“This is to demonstrate the customary dignity of women as matriarchs, mothers, wives and daughters, which confers on them the special protection status from violent attacks from thugs and hoodlums.

Our overall objective is to have a transparent, free, fair and peaceful election.

Nineteen-year-old Collins Sambaya was found in the morning nailed to a tree in his Izava Village in Vihiga County, on Friday. February 18, 2022.

The incident brought Izava Village to a standstill, with shocked and distraught villagers watching in disbelief from a distance as officers rescued Sambaya and rushed him to a hospital.

According to the DCI, a manhunt has been launched for the suspects “with the area security team employing every available resource to apprehend the suspects.”

Vihiga County is an administrative region in the former Western Province of Kenya.

It has a population of 554,622 and an area of 563 km². Vihiga County was split from Kakamega County in 1990.

Shocked Kenyans poured their anger on social media called for the arrest of the perpetrators.

Writing on Facebook, Nicholas Odhiambo Odwar said: “What happened to our humanity? We’ve lost it all. Why, why should people be this cruel?

“A 19-yr old does not have a fully developed mind, he only needs the society to guide him. But what does society do? Turn against each other, we are filled with anger and hatred for one another.

“We are our own enemy. Such a sickening world.”

Eboko Rashid said: “This is too barbaric, diabolical, vexatious, irksome and obnoxious. I mean there is no amount of anger that can warrant such an evil act. The moral fiber of our society has greatly degenerated. This is pathetic, to say the least. The perpetrators MUST face the long arm of the law. What a shame!”

Kipkirui Raymond agreed. He said: “Indeed. So sad. Crucifiers must be brought to book for such inhuman crucifixion act.”

Kyle Knick also condemned the act. He said:”Surely.. How hard was it to take him to a police station and report him… Dear Lord have mercy on our societies.. So sad indeed.. It doesn’t matter what he did wrong, there is a way and a right and humane way of doing things…”

Ferdinand Makokha said: “19 years old, thus just a boy who is in exploration and passing a stage. Support them the right way without physically, emotionally or psychologically torturing or tormenting them but mentoring them to become responsible citizens of this great country.”

Kiriungi Njogu Ke said: “Ngai mwathani! This is sad, wrong, evil and the saddest thing that can happen to anyone. This is cruel and so hurting. No matter the crime, this one has gone overboard. Humans are dangerous. Animals have fewer brains but can not behave like this. Am so teary. May justice prevail.”

Jubilation in Nassarawa as NDPHC adds 240MW,"The Nasarawa State Governor, Engr. Abdullahi Sule, has said there are jubilations across Nasarawa State over the recently energised Lafia 2X150 MVA & 2X60 /132/33/330 KV Transmission Substation that will add 240Mw to their supply.

It was earlier completed by Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC).

President Muhamadu Buhari is scheduled to formally commission the substation on Thursday next week.

Head, Communication & Public Relations, Mr. Emmanuel Ojor, revealed this in a press release at the weekend.

Speaking during a pre-commissioning inspection to the Substation by the Executive Director, Networks, NDPHC Limited, Engr. Ifeoluwa Oyedele and his team on Tuesday, Engr. Sule, who was represented by his deputy, Dr. Emmanuel Akabe, said with the completion of the substation has come “praise galore for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari across the state.”

He thanked President Buhari, the management and staff of NDPHC, and all those involved in the execution of the project, stressing that it will definitely improve the economy of Nasarawa State.

“Small, medium, and micro enterprises will all thrive because they need energy,” he said.

Earlier, Oyedele had commended the Governor and his predecessor, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura for their doggedness in the pursuit for the development of their State.

He said, although the National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP), Lafia Substation was funded by the Federation, it was important to emphasise the contributions of Engr. Sule and his predecessor.

“On the day that we came to take over this site, a Certificate of Occupancy had been issued. In three years, no worker – whether expatriate or local has been harassed – not to talk of being kidnapped or any such thing.

“And since the incumbent Governor took over, he has assumed the role of Project Manager. He has visited this site more than 33 times. He is purely showing good example. To see a Governor who is interested in the progress and development of his people, is commendable. I remember that he visited the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), the Nigeria Customs Service and the Federal Ministry of Finance to facilitate the early release of imported materials for the project when their clearance was being delayed. If all Nigerians are like this, this country would be a better place.”

The Lafia Transmission Substation is equipped with State-of-the-Art Digital Control and Protection facilities with fully functional Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) that enhances real-time operational flexibility, monitoring & control of all the substation electrical variables.

The project will also help to provide back feed to the FCT, whenever necessary since FCT is being served from Shiroro and Geregu Power Stations.","The Nasarawa State Governor, Engr.

Gombe community leaders call for investigation into causes of communal crisis,"Leaders of Lunguda Communities of Nyuwar and Jessu in Balanga Local Government Area of Gombe State on Friday called for in-depth investigation into causes of recurring attacks on their communities by neighbouring Waja communities, despite various peace initiatives.

The District Head of Nyuwar, Chief James Pisaghi and the Village Head of Sabon Layi in Jessu, Mr. Busa Zwaye who made the call during an advocacy visit facilitated by West African Network for Peace building, WANEP in collaboration with Kebetkache Women Development and Resource Centre from Port Harcourt, Rivers State and Humanity First Nigeria in Gombe, said this has become imperative in order to find a lasting solution.

The two traditional rulers lamented that despite the intervention by both Gombe and Adamawa states governments, peace has continued to elude the two communities, leading to over one thousand Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, scattered in neighbouring communities of Cham, Bambam and Yolde.

The District Head of Nyuwar, Chief James Pisaghi, who was a former Secretary to Gombe State Government, said various peace negotiations/mediations, meetings, dialogues held and agreements signed would continue to be ignored and attacks would continue unless the matter was traced to its roots.

Pisaghi said the recent attack on Nyuwar on the 8th of February, 2022, came to them as a surprised, because they thought they had found a solution to the main cause of the crisis between the Lunguda and Waja speaking communities with the renewed interactions between them which had cooled tempers.

He said his people remained grateful to the various interventions from outside their communities, but that the interventions were mere scratches on the surface, unless the real reasons for the attacks were known.

“My own understanding of the crisis is that, I think it’s being brushed on the surface. We have not gone deep into it to know what the real causes, immediate and remote are.” he said.

The Village Head of Sabon Layi, Mr. Busa Zwaye, said his community was hosting about a thousand displaced people from Nyuwar, who were attacked on Tuesday last week, 8th of February, 2022.

He wondered how the two tribes who had lived together for over 300 years suddenly turned to sworn enemies.

The National Coordinator of WANEP, Mrs. Bridget Osakwe, said the most strategic move by both leaders of the Lunguda and Waja Communities should be the physical demonstration of forgiveness and the show of unity by them, so that the followership can naturally emulate it.

After the April 2021 attack both Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State and his Adamawa state counterpart brought the two tribes leaders to sign a peace accord at Numa in Adamawa state but the attack continued especially on Nyuwar and Jessu communities unabated.","Leaders of Lunguda Communities of Nyuwar and Jessu in Balanga Local Government Area of Gombe State on Friday called for in-depth investigation into causes of recurring attacks on their communities by neighbouring Waja communities, despite various peace initiatives.

"Nigerian airlines increase cost of economy flight tickets to N50,000","By Chinelo Obogo

Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have resolved to increase the cost of economy flight tickets to a minimum of N50, 000 nationwide, Saturday Sun has learned.

At a meeting held in Lagos which had most of the domestic operators present, the association cited the high cost of jet A1 fuel, forex scarcity, double digit inflation, increase in ground handling charges, cost of buying and importation of spare parts among others as reasons for the increase.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Saturday Sun gathered that at the meeting, when the issue of increment was raised, most of the operators were in agreement that the benchmark for economy ticket should be pegged at N50, 000 to most routes but that Green Africa, whose business model is that of a low cost carrier was not in total support. Saturday Sun can also confirm that the increment has already taken effect as a visit to the website of many of the airlines show that economy tickets now sell for N50, 000. At the time of filing this report, economy tickets from Lagos to Abuja which used to cost between N29, 000 and N35, 000, now cost N50, 000. The websites of Dana Air, United Nigeria, Azman Air, Air Peace and Max Air show that economy tickets from Lagos to Abuja are from N50,000. Ibom Air sells for N53,00 and Aero Contractors which used to sell for N26,000 is now N48,365, while Arik Air is N48,500. However, Green Africa, which used to sell for N20, 000 is now selling at N39, 000, excluding cost of baggage.

On Thursday, February 17, Air Peace, United Nigeria and Dana Air sold economy tickets to Owerri from Lagos for less than N30, 000 but at the time of filing this report, economy tickets to the same routes now sells for N50, 000.

At a recent meeting with aviation reporters in Lagos, the Chief Executive Officer of United Nigeria Airline hinted at the possibility of increasing flight tickets due to the high cost of operations. He said that a year ago, aviation fuel was sold at N190 per litre, but that the cost has risen to N400 per litre and that considering the fact that fuel takes up at least 30 per cent of operation cost, many airlines will struggle if there is no price adjustment.

“The least ticket we sold a year ago was N23, 000 when aviation fuel was N190 and the official rate of naira to a dollar then was N340, but today, if forex is available, it is N450 but when it is not available, the alternative market is N570 to a dollar. Despite this, you can still buy your ticket at N20, 000 to N21, 000 and what this means is that as long as all the airlines are buying from the same market and selling tickets at the current rates, any ticket that you buy is being subsidised by the airlines. Why did I say this? aviation fuel, depending on the aircraft type you are flying, could take up to about 30 to 40 per cent of your cost components.

“As you know, for every ticket you sell, you give five per cent of Ticket Sales Charge (TSC) to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), you have other deductions to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and to other airport owners. As a matter of fact, by the time you remove these deductions from the N20, 000 that you charge, you have to use your money to take care of other operational needs.

“In year 2000, you may have bought an air ticket at N2,000, which was about $100 then and 99 per cent of aviation component is foreign exchange denominated. From that N2, 000 up till now, the cost of aircraft has not reduced, salaries to staff have increased, the landing charges and other charges have increased, yet this item of ticket remains same. Safety is very critical in aviation business, but you cannot deal with safety in isolation of efficient operations. It must come with proper financing of your operations. The cost of tickets is very important, yet aviation is a chain and the airline operators are at the centre of the chain. However, there is need to establish a better customer service with operators,” Okonkwo said.","By Chinelo ObogoAirline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have resolved to increase the cost of economy flight tickets to a minimum of N50, 000 nationwide, Saturday Sun has learned.

"ACJA Amendment: Kalu’s bill gets accolades, inputs at public hearing","From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja

A bill for the amendment of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) to create a criminal justice administration legislation that is more effective and humane has been commended by stakeholders, including government agencies and civil rights organisations, among others.

The bill is sponsored by Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu. While applauding the motive of the bill and its sponsor, stakeholders at Wednesday’s public hearing also presented their recommendations to some provisions of sections of the proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The public hearing of the bill entitled, ‘Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (SB: 465) organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters; and Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, had several Federal Government security agencies in attendance. They include the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS), the Nigerian Navy, National Security Adviser (NSA), Nigerian Immigration Services (NIS), Nigerian Air Force (NAF), the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and others.

In his presentation on the legislative proposals, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya commended the motive. He however sought the replacement of some words in Section 14 (3) of the ACJA. General Yahaya who was represented by the Nigerian Army’s Director of Legal Services, Major Mahmood Wambai, suggested that the words “shall be done in the presence of” in Section 14(3) of ACJA should be replaced with “may be done within the sighting distance of.

He stressed that this would give the detaining officer the power to determine the circumstances to permit unrestricted communication between the detainee and any other person.

He added that it would also aid the use of eavesdropping devices during such communications. He said: “The circumstances here could include the nature of the allegation against the detainee, his/her criminal history and the status of the visitor.” On the amendment to Section 17, subsection 3, the Army opposed the inclusion of a new paragraph which reads “such an interpreter shall be at the instance and choice of the suspect held in custody.”

The Army held that it is always the constitutional responsibility of the state to provide an interpreter in all proceedings where a suspect does not understand the language of the court, stressing that the responsibility should not be shifted to the suspect who could end up choosing an interpreter that may do his/her biddings.

Making further recommendations the Nigerian Army also sought another inclusion to the proposed amendment to Section 172 of ACJA which seeks to add the words; “either orally or by a motion on notice “ before the words; “on application to court “. The Army suggested that the following words could be added; “subject to the discretion of the Judge” after the proposed amendment. This according to the COAS will confer on the judge the powers to direct that such application shall be on notice in appropriate cases.

Lauding the initiative to amend the ACJA, the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen Babagana Monguno described the amendment as a welcome development. He was represented by his spokesperson, Zakari Usman. The Nigerian Correctional Service in a submission by its Controller-General, Haliru Nababa applauded the proposed legislative amendment to the ACJA. In its submission the NCS agreed with the amendments Sections 8(4), 14, 17, and 162.

Haliru, who was represented by a top official of the NCS at the public hearing, however opposed the amendments to Sections 223 and Section 229. He maintained that the section does not infringe on the principle of fair hearing. He said: “It does not in any way make the hearing time unreasonable, and has not interfered with the independence and impartiality of a court or other tribunal established by law.”

On its part, the Nigerian Navy disagreed with the deletion of Paragraph 6 section 223 and 229.

Chief of Naval Staff , Vice Admiral AZ Gambo, who was represented by Navy’s Director of Admin, Rear Admiral Kennedy Egbuchulam stated that the section of the ACJA proposed to be deleted has similar provisions in Sections 226(6) and 142 of the Penal Code Act and Armed Forces Act Laws of the Federation of Nigeria respectively.

The paragraph 6 of the bill is seeking to delete the provisions of Sections 223 and 229 of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015. It reads that: “Where a defendant is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he committed a similar offence with which he might have been charged under the provisions of this Act, he may be convicted of the offence, which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it,” and “where a defendant is charged with an offence relating to property and the evidence establishes the commission by him with respect to the same property of another offence, he may be convicted of that other offence although he was not charged with it.”

According to the Nigerian Navy, the intention of the above provisions is that an accused person can be convicted for similar or kindred offences based on evidence on record. Gambo said the extant provisions of the ACJA which was being proposed for deletion do not constitute a breach of the right of fair hearing of an accused person.

Rendering special commendations to the bill’s sponsor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Centre for Socio-Legal Studies described the proposed amendments sought by the bill as highly laudable and commendable.

In a speech read by the centre’s President, Prof Yemi Akinseye – George (SAN), he said the bill’s amendment would address the emerging developments and judicial pronouncements on some of the provisions of the extant Act “as it is intended to address the aspect of concern noticed in the course of implementing the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015.”

Earlier in his remarks, sponsor of the bill and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, said the legislative proposal seeks to amend in the Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2015, the sections contradicting the principles of fair hearing and court jurisdiction as provided in the Constitution. This, he said, is to avert some loggerheads between the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and the constitution.

Kalu, who was represented at the event by Senator Abdu Kwari, maintained that the nation’s constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Kalu emphasised that in line with the provision of the constitution, all authorities in Nigeria shall conform to the constitutional provision.

“Therefore the Administration of Criminal Justice Act shall conform with the supreme provision of the 1999 Constitution as amended.

“Each legal norm of the society derives its validity from the basic norm. Any other law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution must give way or abate.”

“The court has also held that- ‘The constitution of a nation is the ‘fons et origo’ not only of the jurisprudence but also of the legal system,” Kalu said. The former governor of Abia State said the various High Court Rules and Court of Appeal Rules have provisions with regards to the position of pending cases when judges are elevated, adding that more often the position is for the matter to start de novo.

He added that although the constitution says in Section 252(2) that the National Assembly will by law make provision conferring upon the Federal High Court additional powers to those conferred by the Constitution, there exists a lacuna in respect of the position of an elevated judge from the High Court to the Court of Appeal (that is there is a gap that needs to be filled).

Said he: “It will be advisable that the Act be amended to expressly handle the gap created when judges are elevated to the next bench, by being given the right or powers to conclude part-heard cases before moving to the next level.

“Our judicial system recognizes and applies the rule of stare decisis, meaning rules of precedent and hierarchy of courts. More so, our courts are classified according to the constitution and other extant laws. We should clearly demarcate or clearly spell out jurisdiction of court to avoid contradiction and uncertainty.”

Explaining further, the Senate Chief Whip reiterated the aspiration of the legislative amendment to create a criminal justice administration legislation that is both more effective and more humane.

His words: “By ‘more effective,’ I mean that we should respond to crime in ways that produce socially desirable results—greater safety, less fear, less suffering, greater respect for the rule of law and less injustice—and that we do so efficiently, investing our precious financial and human resources in ways that maximize the results we desire.

“By ‘more humane,’ I mean we should respond to crime in ways that recognize the humanity of those victimized by crime, those arrested and convicted of crime, and others who experience the ripple effects of crime and our justice system. This affirmation of humanity, as I see it, incorporates values we hold dear in our democracy, such as equal protection of the laws, access to the rights guaranteed by our constitution, and our fundamental belief in the dignity of the individual.”

The ACJA Amendment Bill passed First Reading on June 30 2020. It also passed the Second Reading on December 8 2020.","While applauding the motive of the bill and its sponsor, stakeholders at Wednesday’s public hearing also presented their recommendations to some provisions of sections of the proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act.
The public hearing of the bill entitled, ‘Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (SB: 465) organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters; and Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, had several Federal Government security agencies in attendance.
The paragraph 6 of the bill is seeking to delete the provisions of Sections 223 and 229 of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015.
This, he said, is to avert some loggerheads between the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and the constitution.

"Osun APC primary: Aregbesola, Oyetola know fate today","From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo

It is bound to be a battle of the titans as the state’s All Progressives Congress (APC) holds its primary election today. The soul of the party is being fought for between Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior, and the fourth civilian governor of Osun State, and the current Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, who also doubles as his successor.

The earth is literally going to shake as supporters of Aregbesola, and Oyetola who is seeking for a re-election to which his predecessor is vehemently opposed seek to outdo each other at the polls. Already, Aregbesola has urged the party faithful in the state to come out in their thousands to ensure that his anointed candidate, Moshood Adeoti, emerges the party’s chosen one. But in a related development, a faction of the party loyal to him has raised the alarm over alleged plan by Oyetola to rig the election.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Its governorship aspirant of the party and the former Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti who addressed a press conference in Osogbo yesterday faulted Governor Oyetola’s membership of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (NCECPC) of APC till date.

He said the governor’s failure to resign from the committee was as a result of his influence that he claimed was against the party’s constitution, adding that the governor would use the advantage over him in the primary election.

He said: “In the spirit of fair play, objectivity and natural justice, Governor Oyetola is not supposed to remain in the membership of the NCECPC. What we are witnessing is a case of a thief adjudicating in his own case. He can never convict himself. Governor Oyetola’s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if it is allowed to pass us by. We put on record, the fact that The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of APC to which I belong, has not been availed with the membership register of the party, which will be the basis of voting. We put on record that there ought to have been display of party register, with claims and objections made before we go into voting.

“We recall that TOP had reported the abuse and manipulation to which the party’s register had been subjected to while being compiled by Governor Oyetola and his cabinet members. And this allegation was unattended to, but cannot be wished away. We state that if there is no deliberate attempt to manipulate the primary process, it is important to make the membership register available, display it for claims and objections before using it for the primary election. The APC, we say with confidence, will not want to involve itself in a muddled-up arrangement that could tarnish its democratic image.”

But in his reaction to Adeoti’s allegations, the APC’s Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Mr Kunle Oyatomi noted that Aregbesola/Adeoti’s faction of the party are crying wolf where there is none. He added that Governor Oyetola is a peace-loving person who would not encourage violence of any kind in any issue that involves members of his party.

He said that the Osun Progressives (TOP) which Adeoti referred to has no locus standi as the only recognized leadership of the APC in the state is under the chairmanship of Prince Gboyega Famodun while Governor Oyetola is the leader of the party. He promised that the primary election would be free and fair, assuring that the Governor or any leader of the party would not interfere in the exercise.

Oyatomi who said there was no cause for the alarm regarding the primary election, like Aregbesola earlier did, called on members of the APC across the state to troop out in large numbers and assemble at their wards’ voting centres throughout the state from 8.00am today to participate fully in the direct primary.

The party’s spokesman said that the APC’s candidate for the July 16 governorship election will be elected by all card-carrying members of the party and urged them not to be scared by rumours of violence and attack. He also advised to comport themselves orderly, peacefully and responsibly in order to ensure a successful election.","From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, OsogboIt is bound to be a battle of the titans as the state’s All Progressives Congress (APC) holds its primary election today.

"War in Osun as Oyetola, Adeoti, Battle for APC’s Guber Ticket Today","*Governor AbdulRazaq heads 7-man election supervision team, says he’ll be fair to all

Bennett Oghifo in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo

Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and the Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, who is Oyetola’s predecessor, will today go to war, as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) holds direct primary elections across the 322 wards in the state to pick its candidate for the governorship election holding next July.

The Osun State Governor and Aregbesola have been at loggerheads for almost three years, over the control of the state and the party.

Oyetola is seeking the party’s ticket to run for a second term while Aregbesola and his political movement, The Osun Progressives (TOP) are backing erstwhile Secretary to the Osun State Government, Moshood Adeoti to unseat Oyetola.

Many agree that Oyetola has performed creditably well since he assumed office despite the mountain of debt left behind by Aregbesola.

Aside the power of incumbency, as well as his achievements in the past three and half years in office, Oyetola enjoys the support of former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the national leadership of the party and the backing of the State Executive of the party, led by Adegboyega Famodun.

But Aregbesloa insists Oyetola must not get the party’s ticket to run for a second term because the governor has been disloyal to him and the party members in the state.

The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party has sent a seven-man team led by Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State to supervise today’s primary in the state. Senator Julius Ucha is the Secretary of the committee.

Other members of the committee are Senator Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe, Hon. Abdulkarim Abdulraman, Hon. Wale Raji, Mrs. Yetunde Imolehin and Mr. Ofonmbuk Okon Bassey.

There were moves by some chieftains of the party to postpone the primary in order to address the rift between Oyetola and Aregbesola, but the national body resisted the moves.

Incidentally, AbdulRazaq has been engaged in a feud with the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, just like the case between Oyetola and Aregbesola.

But AbdulRazaq promised all contestants that he would be fair to them in the conduct of the primary election.

He said he would act in strict compliance with APC’s Constitution in the conduct of the election.

The governor said he and other members of the panel on the Osun primary were looking forward to conducting a free and fair primary election in the state.

Oyetola has persistently resisted Aregbesola’s moves to operate as the Godfather of Osun State politics and dictate to him as the governor, on the day to day running of the state.

This has resulted in numerous violent clashes among supporters of the two camps.

The Special Adviser to Oyetola on Political Affairs, Sunday Akere, explains further: “Oyetola did not fight Aregbesola. He (Aregbesola) declared that Oyetola’s tenure was his third term and he wanted to be in charge. He also promised those close to him that 80 per cent of them would return as cabinet members, which did not happen. The ex-governor thought the eight-year tenure was for eternity. It has ended but he could not believe that reality. The root cause of the issue is what I just said.”

The Chairman, Elders’ Caucus of the Osun State APC, Sola Akinwumi described the “street shows” by Aregbesola as a display of thuggery and hooliganism.

Akinwumi adds: “As a matter of fact, the erstwhile governor belittles himself and I am very sure he didn’t know the implications of what he did. He acted so low and naively as if he was the sitting governor.

“Was he telling us that there are two governors in the State? Has he forgotten that he is no longer a Governor? We have known his intention and we leave everyone to his or her conscience.”

Meanwhile, members of the APC in Osun State have been urged to remain focused and resolute in their resolve to re-elect Oyetola at the party’s primary election coming up today, as they have demonstrated during the strategic tour conducted round the state.

The Secretary to the State Government, Prince Oluwole Oyebamiji gave the charge in a press statement, describing the atmosphere of tension recently created in the State as a mere distraction.

The SSG affirmed in the statement that Osun “is the most peaceful state and will remain so during and after the primary election.”

He then urged every member of the public to embrace peace and go about their lawful duties without any fear.

The statement further revealed that the Oyetola administration had touched lives and impacted the society in an unprecedented way without relegating human capital development to the background.

Aregbesola: Oyetola Waging War against Me

On the other hand, Aregbesola alleged that Oyetola had been waging a war against him since becoming the governor.

The Interior Minister reiterated this in Ikire town last Thursday while addressing a rally held to garner support for Adeoti, his anointed candidate in today’s primaries.

Speaking in Yoruba, Aregbesola said he pleaded with Oyetola for about two years not to fight him, adding that his successor rejected his advice, which made him call his supporters to salvage the party.

He said, “I begged him (Oyetola) for two years; I told him that people must not mock us; I told him that he was heading for destruction. I served this state with the whole of my heart; I also positioned Oyetola so that he could succeed me in office.

“When we came to this town (Ikire) for his campaign, we were drenched in rain from the Akire’s palace to this place. He got to the office and claimed I am his enemy; those who contested against him during our party primary he pulled closer, while he is fighting me.

“Since Oyetola assumed office, he has waged a war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as the governor; I told him that I heard him and that now that he had been governor, what else did he want?

“I begged him for two years; I sent people to help me beg him and that he should not love me, but he must not fight me; even if he wanted to fight me, he should not abuse me and destroy my legacies.

“All that I warned him not to do was what he did. He opposed what I did; all the things I did together with him for eight years, he opposed and reversed them. He thought he could destroy me through my work; nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately towed that path. He waged a war against me and refused to listen to my pleas until he got rid of me.”

Sack Aregbesola Now, Coalition Tells Buhari

Meanwhile, a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations in Osun State has demanded the sack of Aregbesola for promoting civil unrest ahead of today’s governorship primary election.

The Spokesperson of the Coalition, Mr. Wasiu Alli, while addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, said according to the 5th Schedule of the constitution, Aregbesola was expected to act only in ways that promote National Security and does not expose Nigerians anywhere to threats to their lives and property.

The Coalition added that where the contrary becomes the case, erring government officials must receive appropriate sanctions.

The coalition said Aregbesola in the past one week had engaged in a public show of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the State, denigration of Elder Statesmen, among many others.

It noted that the recent utterances of Aregbesola were already heating the polity in the State to a point where residents now live in fear.

It stated: “While superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies (NSCDC and NPF) into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.

“Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, despite being responsible for coordination of public security, is, by his actions, promoting disunity and insubordination between two key security agencies that should ordinarily be cooperating. This portends grave danger for the maintenance of peace and security within Osun State and indeed, Nigeria.”

The coalition said if the federal government failed to call Aregbesola to order and charge him to focus on his official responsibilities instead of going about causing civil unrest, he would end up inflaming the otherwise peaceful Osun State.

It said, “Where he cannot be cautioned, we demand his outright sack or redeployment if he cannot act responsibly in line with the dictates of the office he presently holds. A public officer must never be seen acting contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.”

Responding, Aregbesola said the Coalition was hurriedly put together and plotted by the leadership of the government in Osun State.

The minister, who responded in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, insisted that the state government in particular had mounted a campaign of calumny against the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) because they were providing security for some citizens in Osun while they hold meetings and ward off attacks against them.

You Have Been Chosen to Rule Osun for Second Term, Ataoja, Olobu Tell Oyetola

The Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Oyetunji Olanipekun, and the Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, yesterday reiterated their support for Governor Oyetola, saying they were resolute to work for his success in the forthcoming governorship election.

The monarchs showered encomiums and prayers on the governor for his modest achievements in the last three years, just as they assured him of their royal backing before, during and after the July 16 governorship election in the State.

This is even as Oyetola rounded off his strategic engagement tour across the nine Federal Constituencies of the State in Osogbo, the State capital, on Thursday night.

Oyetola had in the last three weeks embarked on a familiarisation visit to each of the 30 local government areas, including Ife-East Area Office, to identify and solidarise with the newly-elected executives of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State.

Receiving the Governor in his palace, the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, threw his weight behind Governor Oyetola whom he described as a promise keeper.

In the same vein, Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, acknowledged the monumental achievements of the Administration of Governor Oyetola, which he described as unprecedented in the history of the State.

Oba Olaniyan, who implored the Governor to remain steadfast and not be distracted, said, “We are solidly behind you and we are ready to mobilise our subjects to re-elect you.”

APC Set to Postpone National Convention by Two Weeks,"Caretaker Committee to meet President for approval

By Adedayo Akinwale

The National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 may not be held on that day after all.

THISDAY can authoritatively confirm that the convention will be postponed by two weeks.

Efforts to speak to the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, who is also the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, on this latest development proved abortive.

Though there is no formal announcement yet, a very reliable party source informed THISDAY last night that the (CECPC) and the APC governors would meet President Muhammadu Buhari today to propose a new date, which is likely to be March 12.

The source who preferred anonymity said, “The convention has been postponed by two weeks but it is not official yet. The Caretaker Committee and the governors will meet with the President on Saturday (today) to propose the new date.”

Also, a former member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who pleaded for anonymity, said it was already clear that the convention would not hold, “because there are some things that needed to be done for the convention to hold as scheduled on February 26 and most of them had not been done, with few days to February 26.”

The source stressed that, for instance, one of the things that ought to have been done was zoning of party offices.

He continued: “People have not bought forms and people cannot buy form if the zoning is not done; and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don’t know the zoning, you can’t buy a form.

“There are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. I remember that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees beside the main convention committee.”

Reacting to the purported plans by some governors and a principal officer in the Senate to foist Senator Abdulahi Adamu on the party, he said “while individuals or groups can have preference, President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who becomes the next Chairman of the party.

“Whatever you are hearing now are mere speculations because nobody can push anybody. All of them are waiting for the president. Everybody is waiting for the president and that is why until the president says this is the chairman before they can now zone other positions around where he comes from.

“So, they have to know whom; they have to know which zone he is from before they can now zone the remaining offices based on that. But that is not to say that individual governors or some group will not have their preferences. But those cannot mean anything, except such individuals or groups are able to convince the president to now adopt their own.”

WHO Names Nigeria among Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Production of COVID-19 Vaccine,"Deji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja

The Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries – Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia – as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.

Ghebreyesus who announced this yesterday at the European Union – African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.

The announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.

The mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.

Instead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern — COVID-19 in this case.

This triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.

Ghebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.

With the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.

President Buhari has since welcomed the development.

In his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.

He expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.

Buhari said: “We shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.”

While commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa’s developmental projections.

“In the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,” Buhari said.

Responding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: “This is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.”

The global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

Also French President, Emmanuel Macron said: “Improved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.”

On his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together “to build new solutions to protect what is most precious – our health and our lives.” He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.

The WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.

NULGE Alerts Soludo of Continuous Subletting of Anambra’s Revenue Windows to Politicians,"David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka

Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) yesterday raised the alarm over the subletting of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, had recently threatened to revoke all revenue windows allocated to politicians through an executive order on the morning of his swearing-in.

NULGE said that it has information that as Governor Obiano administration winds down, the state revenue board is allocating revenue windows to their cronies, with the intention to hijack the state’s resources.

The group’s state president, Mr. Chikwelu Adigwe who briefed members at the state secretariat of the union in Awka, said most of the revenue windows being sold out belong to the local government areas.

He also protested the hijacking of most revenues being collected by the local government councils, thereby rendering them useless.

“The condition of our service is no longer acceptable to us, so we want to make our voices heard.

“We are doing all we can during this transition period to ensure that the right things are done. We have written to the transition committee, we have also written to the Assembly to complain about the continuous confirming of transition committee chairmen, instead of holding local government elections.

“Right now, we have it on good authority that the state revenue board is still allocating revenue windows to politicians, and we want to warn the governor-elect about this.

“We are here today to complain about the way the system is running. The system was not like this when we came into the service. Things have gone so bad.

“When we were in school, we heard that there were three tiers of government, but gradually, the local government has been rendered redundant and non-existent. Our job is gradually being taken away by the state, but we will not allow this to continue.”

The union said it has resolved to take back all revenue windows belonging to it, including stall fees, wheel barrow levies, liquor license and many others, which have been taken from them by the state government.

The union also urged Soludo to ensure conduct of local government elections within three months of his swearing-in, ensure the reconstitution of the Local Government Service Commission to include local government workers, instead of an all-politicians affairs, among others.

“We have charged our members to go out and collect revenues due to their various local government councils. Any shop owner who pays revenue touts, should be ready to pay twice. We are not preaching war here, but will not run away from war,” Adigwe said.

2023: PDP BoT Chairman Cautions Party’s Presidential Aspirants against Uncomplimentary Comments,"Hammed Shittu in Ilorin

Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin, has cautioned all the presidential aspirants of the party against making uncomplimentary comments that could affect the electoral victory of the PDP in the next general elections.

He therefore urged them to continue to maintain decorum over their presidential aspirations.

Presidential aspirants in the party had engaged in a proxy war recently over the issue.

The latest was the attack by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike on the leader of the technical committee of Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign, Raymond Dokpesi calling him a mole working for APC.

But, Senator Jibrin yesterday in Ilorin during the turbaning ceremony of former National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Bareje as the Tafida of Ilorin by the Emir, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, said the party would come out with its position on the matter very soon.

He said, “I will urge all our presidential aspirants to be calm about the issue of their presidential aspirations.

“To us, the country comes first and we will soon come out with our position on the presidential contest for all our aspirants, this is very important.

“And another important thing is that the party is yet to zone it to any party of the country.”

On the issue of the Electoral Act, the PDP BoT chairman said “President Muhammadu Buhari should assent to it at the right time.”

Meanwhile, former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki has felicitated with Baraje on his turbaning as the Tafida of Ilorin Emirate by the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Zulu Gambari.

In a statement by Saraki’s Press Officer on Local Matters, Mr. Abdulganiyu Abdulqadir, he lauded the highly respected monarch for identifying Baraje, as worthy of the position.

While stating that the traditional honour was well-deserved, he described the former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as a patriotic, bonafide and committed son of the Emirate who had contributed immensely to the uplift of the Ilorin Emirate, Kwara and Nigeria at large.

The statement read: “As you attain this enviable position today, I felicitate with you and your family as well as the Ilorin Emirate.

“Your conferment as the Tafida of Ilorin, the second personality to be honoured in the Ilorin Emirate, underscores your importance having contributed your quota as a seasoned educationist, administrator, and astute political figure.

“This is an indication of how much you are valued by the Emirate and we do hope you continue to use your personality and new office towards the advancement of Ilorin Emirate and Kwara State.”

Saraki prayed to God to grant the new Tafida of Ilorin, the life, sound health and wisdom to excel in the new task.

Also present at the colourful occasion include, the former Governor of Kwara, Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed, former Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dakwambo, former Minister of Youths and Sports, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, Senator Rafiu Adebayo Ibrahim, Senator Dino Malaye, the Director General, National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Prof. Abubakar Olanrewaju Sulaiman and former Speaker of Kwara State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Ali Ahmad.

Others include, Director General, National Institute of Legislative Studies, Prof. Suleiman Abubakar, Grand Mufti of Ilorin, Sheikh Suleiman Onikijipa, billionaire oil magnate, Hajia Muinat Shagaya, Deputy Governor of Sokoto State, Manir Muhammed and the PDP chairman, Alhaji Bello Aliyu Goronyo, among others

"EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing","The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho – a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.

SaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on “palace instructions.”



SaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.

“So everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,” a source said.

""It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don’t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.

""Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.



""They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son’s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.

""They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.""

SaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.

He was charged with stealing and conspiracy

Speaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.

“How is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.

""Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn’t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it’s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.

“The state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they’ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,” he said.

SaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin’s palace started.

He is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.



In the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, “Before reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.

“I am not on any payroll, I don’t receive any salary. My family don’t get any benefit or compensation. They haven’t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.

“I don’t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don’t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.

“It all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare’s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.

“Meanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn’t very easy; I couldn’t run because they would falsely accuse me. Though I kept on complaining to the person that brought me (Rowland), he kept telling me to keep calm that I can run when everything is over. He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.

“On May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don’t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn’t do. I was really scared.

“Then I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don’t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.

“The story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week. I waited for weeks but he never showed up but kept giving excuses when called.

“I was detained for two months, a week and a day. (May 31 to August 8, 2021); my parents never visited nor called to check up on me. It was my girlfriend that kept on bringing food to me. It wasn’t really easy though.

“Note that my parents’ property; a house on 100 by 100 and extra land were seized by the palace even before investigations started. The properties have not been returned yet.

“So after being detained again on October 25, 2021, we were charged to court. We were taken to a High Court for a stealing case. We were remanded in Oko Prison on October 26, 2021, as awaiting trial persons.

“So on a fateful day, we were called for a visit by some prison wardens that there were some visitors from the palace. On getting there, we saw Dennis Osaretin, Oyaniyen and one other palace functionary who I assume the palace sent to check to see if we were really suffering.

“Tomorrow is Christmas and I am still in prison; worst Christmas ever not for me though because I always celebrate it without going out or having fun but it’s actually the worst Christmas for my family. How are they going to celebrate Christmas knowing their son, brother is in prison? Don’t really know how they feel now but I still give thanks to GOD.”

Frank Irabor, Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, told SaharaReporters that the monarch is too big to respond to such allegations, especially as the matter is in court.

""I don't understand the case you are talking about, the case is in court, do you want Omo n'Oba (Oba of Benin) to react to that?

""If someone is detained, even for one year, that is at the discretion of the judge or the agency handling the case. They will want to continue to remand the person, maybe to conclude their investigation.

""They should not drag Omo n'Oba into it at all; he is too big for that. So there is no need to say the palace or the secretary should react. Let the court handle it. Please, he is too big for that,"" Irabor said.

Killing in the name of Biafra!,"Killing, killing, killing in the name of Biafra! When did murder become typical of the Igbo stock? When did taking innocent lives become classic in Igbo land? In Igbo cosmology, murder, ‘Igbu oshu’ is a cardinal sin deserving of banishment. A murderer is banished from the community and the land is cleansed of the abomination.

Have the Igbo settled for this governing abomination? Have the elders been functionally vasectomised? How can murder, anarchy, and fear reign in the land uncontested? Have we become a people given to bloodletting, beheading and cannibalism? Have we gone backwards in our evolution as a humane and cosmopolitan people to become savages?

Why has this cumulus of evil persisted and remained hanging over an entire region? A region that was once prosperous, peaceful and bubbling on the growth index is now a slaughterhouse that investors are running away from. The south-east is being destroyed by the same people who claim to be fighting for the people.

Security agents have been killed. Traditional rulers have been killed. Men have been killed and women have been raped and killed by this band of parademons. A few days ago, ‘’unknown gunmen’’ attacked a police station and killed three policemen in Ebonyi. Last week, gunmen killed seven community leaders in Imo. And the killings persist.

It has now become customary for residents of the south-east to wake up to severed heads dangling from poles in market squares, roads and community facilities. An unsleeping evil has taken over the land.

On Wednesday, these ‘’unknown gunmen’’ invaded a cattle market at Omumauzor; a community in Ukwa West LGA of Abia. The market is said to be peopled by Nigerians from the north. They came not to buy cattle, but to kill. By the time they were done, eight citizens were dead. These parademons did not spare anything, they killed cattle and set the market ablaze. What sort of bestiality is this?

According to Abia state government, the gunmen struck around 11pm on Tuesday. “On Tuesday, 15th February 2022 at about 11:35pm, some yet-to-be-identified hoodlums allegedly invaded traders at the New Cattle Market located in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of our dear state. We are shocked and saddened by this mindless and barbaric act of violence that claimed the lives of about 8 innocent citizens of our great country and we totally condemn this dastardly act together with its wicked perpetrators,’’ the state government said.

The attack appears to be ethnically-motivated and targeted. This makes it very dangerous. These ravagers are not only threatening the lives of Igbo citizens and other Nigerians in the south-east, they are also jeopardising the safety and security of Igbo citizens in other parts of the country.

As I said in the column, ‘Ndi Igbo stand for One Nigeria’, those crusading for the secession of the south-east today are deficient students of history and sociology. Even the late Odumegwu Ojukwu, the captain of the secessionist struggle during the war, regretted that devastating episode in our history. Ojukwu said: ‘’I don’t think the second war is necessary. We should have learnt from the first one.”

There is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.

The Igbo elite and citizens must take a stand to end this fast descent into utter devastation. Instead of angling for the presidency in 2023, we should work at ending the carnage in our home. Onye ulo ya na-agba oku, anaghi achu oke. Our house is on fire we cannot afford to be chasing a will-o-the-wisp.

‘To make COVID-19 the last’ -- Bill Gates to release book on preventing future pandemics,"Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), says he has written a book on how to prevent future pandemics.

In a recent newsletter, Gates said he spent the last two years working with his partners and colleagues at the Gates Foundation to stop COVID-19.

He added that the book titled ‘How to Prevent the Next Pandemic’ is about what he learned researching COVID-19 to make sure no one suffers through the misery of the last two years again.

“The last two years have caused unbelievable amounts of hardship around the world… whenever I see the suffering that COVID has created — every time I read about the latest death toll or hear about someone who lost their job or drive by a school that is closed — I can’t help but think: We don’t have to do this again,” he said.

“COVID has only made it clearer that the world needs to prioritize eliminating pandemics as a threat to humanity. I’ve been following COVID since the early days of the outbreak, working with experts from inside and out of the Gates Foundation who are championing a more equitable response and have been fighting infectious diseases for decades.

“I’ve learned a lot in the process — both about this pandemic and how we stop the next one — and I want to share what I’ve heard with people. So, I started writing a book about how we can make sure that no one suffers through a pandemic ever again.”

He said that the book, which launches on May 3, 2022, contains a step by step plan, innovations and tools on how to equitably stop pathogens early.

He also said that he outlined processes that can be used to provide better healthcare for everyone globally.

Tension in Osun as APC holds governorship primary today,"By Olusesan Laoye

The political atmosphere in Osun State, is intense Saturday morning, as the ruling party in the state, the All Progressive Congress (APC), holds its governorship primary election amid escalating rift between the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola.

Across Osogbo, the state capital, there is presence of the security personnel at every corner, signaling that they are ready to deal with any one who forments trouble, but their mere presence has made residents apprehensive.

Security men, including the Police, the Army, Civil Defence, DSS, among others, are seen patrolling the streets Osogbo and other major cities in the state.

On Friday, as a result of the presence of the armed security operatives people hurried to their homes, meaning that shops and markets closed very early.

Some of those interviewed by the Business Hallmark said they were scared and could not tell what could happen at the venues of the primary, since voting would be done at ward level, before the results are collateral at the state’s party secretariat in Osogbo.

Some noted that the heavy security personnel was uncalled for since it is just a primary to decide who gets the ticket of the party, even as they wondered what would then happen on the election day proper.

The state has been boiling for the past few days over the crisis between the former governor, now Minister of Interior, Aregbesola and Mr. Oyetola, both of whom have been campaigning aggressively.

Aregbesola is supporting the former Secretary to the government during his tenure, Moshood Adeoti against Oyetola who wants the ticket of the party for a second term.

The former governor has since vowed to use all machineries at his disposal to prevent Oyetola’s second term, but he is unlikely to stop the governor who appears to be very much in control of the state.

The feud between the duo also heightened the frosty relationship which has been existing between Tinubu and Aregbesola.","By Olusesan LaoyeThe political atmosphere in Osun State, is intense Saturday morning, as the ruling party in the state, the All Progressive Congress (APC), holds its governorship primary election amid escalating rift between the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola.

Osun PDP faction rejects appointment of Sunday Bisi as acting chairman,"By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo

A faction of the Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has frowned at a letter “purportedly communicating” a decision of the National Working Committee of the party to appoint Mr Sunday Bisi as the acting chairman of the party.

Recall that a couple of days ago, the intra-party leadership squabble bedeviling the major opposition party in the state, was said to have been finally laid to rest with a landmark judgement delivered by Justice Aderibigbe of the State High Court sitting in Ile-Ife.

The court ruled that Hon Soji Adagunodo was the Chairman of the party before his resignation from office, while stressing further in its verdict that the congress conducted under the leadership of Hon Adagunodo and all other legitimate actions done by him while in office were valid.

Members of the group therefore argue that from the judgement it was clear that, part of the actions done in office by the Hon Adagunodo was handing over to Barr wale Ojo, who is the vice Chairman from the region/zone of the former Chairman before his resignation from office.

The members, including the acting chairman of the faction, Wale Ojo, maintained that they were the authentic Exco of the PDP in the state.

Speaking at the rally, Mr. Ojo said ” As you can see, our people from across the 30 local governments and the Area office have converged here today to show they’re displeased with the position of the NWC.

“Let me say to you in clear terms, this is about constitionality and in the face of the law I remain the valid and legally recognized State Acting Chairman of Osun PDP. If you ask me, I would tell you unequivocally and expressly that the letter sent out as the position of the NWC of our great party is a mistake and this mistake will be pointed out and corrected.”

Our correspondent also spoke to one of the leaders of the group who is a commissioner during the tenure of Prince Olagunsoye oyinlola, Sooko Sunday Adewole.

He said, “We have gathered this afternoon to send strong signal to the Sen Iyorchia Ayu’s led NWC of our great party to watch their back. He should desist from walking on the same path as the erstwhile occupant of that office, Prince Uche Secondus did.”

A former Chairman of the Party in Osun, Barr. Ojo Williams, said “the Peoples’ Democratic Party which you all know is a democratic and law abiding party. What are we as a party going to campaign with, if we cannot obey a simple court pronouncement?

“The constitution of our party is supreme. What this implies is that the dictates of the party constitution is supreme and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

9PSB CEO Seeks Targeted Content to Accelerate Nigeria’s Financial Inclusion,"The Chief Executive Officer, 9PSB, Branka Mracajac, has emphasized the need to pay close attention to content creation as an important factor in driving and accelerating financial inclusion in the country, stating that it is capable of enhancing the future of digital banking in the long-term.

Mracajac made this assertion, while presenting a keynote address, themed “Content Creation and Financial Inclusion; The Future of Digital Banking” at the Tech Summit Ogun 2022, which held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Abeokuta, Ogun State on Thursday February 17, 2022.

According to her, while there are ongoing efforts to support the country’s financial inclusion drive, a lot more rest on formulating tailored strategies that address specific needs. “Providing access to the banking agents and touch points, across the country is happening as we speak; payment service banks,

microfinance banks, and FinTech companies are all working on this. But will this be enough? Will the access to digital banks change the mindset of Nigerians in rural areas of the country and be enough to drive the transition from cash to cashless society?” she questioned.

Proffering the way forward, Mracajac stressed the need to provide financial literacy through content that speaks to an average Nigerian in unserved rural areas of the country, stating that financial inclusion is a process, not just a point in time and space that we want to reach.

She added that, developing content that speaks only to the already banked and mirroring the digital financial habits of those who are fully included and heavily banked, will not help to keep the newly on-boarded in the system long-term.

She stated: “While creating and delivering the content for financial inclusion, we need to have in mind the needs of its beneficiaries, the targeted end-users of the financial services who are currently underserved and the only sustainable way is that we join our forces and create the content – apps and services that will address the specific needs of a farmer in Benue, market women in Onitsha, trader in Kano, fisherman in Delta, and the woman selling ofada rice in Ogun State.”

Speaking further, she noted that, to drive the offline individuals and MSMEs from cash to cashless, from analog to digital and from informal to formal, content creators need to focus on two major goals; one, to deliver relevant and on-point digital financial literacy content, educating people about the principles, ways, modules, and benefits of banking. The second one, she stated, is needed for sustainable Financial inclusion: delivery of digital banking services that are a reflection of the lifestyle of the currently unbanked and underserved population.

She called on all stakeholders within the financial ecosystem, including content creators to work collectively to develop and implement a digital content strategy for the unbanked to move the financial inclusion needle and ultimately advance the economy, society and improve life of every Nigerian.

In his own keynote address, titled “Disruptive Innovation: Production and Distribution of Creative Content, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), Dr. Abimbola Alale remarked that the quality of creatives and start-ups that Nigeria has produced is a testament to the potential of the ecosystem, and as such the ministry will continue to support the tech and creative entrepreneurs to play their part in developing Nigeria’s digital economy.

The Tech Summit Ogun is an annual convergence of Tech disruptors, innovators, startups, organizations and technology enthusiast in Ogun State, aimed at spurring technological innovation towards the digital transformation and technological advancement of Ogun State. This year, the summit attracted over 2000 participants, mainly the youths and start-ups.

Niger Govt Lauds CSJ On Fiscal Transparency Training,"The Niger State government has praised the work of the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) in training public officials in the state on the principles and practice of fiscal transparency.

The state’s commissioner for finance, Alhaji Zakari Abubakar, who spoke at the four-day ‘train the trainers’ capacity building on increasing citizen’s participation in the budget process in Minna, told the participants that the presence of a team of professionals from CSJ in their midst was a rare opportunity that must not be allowed to elude them.

The training was organised under the State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) Programme for Results- a reform programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and performance. A component of the SFTAS programme is the Disbursement Linked Indicator 2 (DLI 2) focused on “Increasing Openness and Citizens Engagement in the Budget Process”.

The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) is the firm hired by the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning under the SFTAS to develop, design and provide support for states in the development of a process guide for the state budget office that details the flow of budget development process and documents required for fiscal transparency.

The Niger State finance commissioner who is also overseeing the Niger State Planning Commission said, “A lot of concerted efforts have been made by SFTAS in the last three years towards developing templates and tools alongside knowledge needed to sustain and strengthen the achievement of the programme.”

He said Niger State was one of the few entities in Nigeria that keyed into SFTAS right from inception.

The training which drew participants from the Niger State Ministry of Finance, Niger State Planning Commission, Niger State Auditor-General Office, Accountant General’s Office and members of the civil society organisations was focused on helping participants integrate ideas on citizens’ participation in the budgeting processes and increase transparency across all stages of the budget.

"NIFAA, Pathfinder Sensitise Faith Leaders On COVID-19 Vaccines","The Nigerian Inter-Faith Action Association (NIFAA) in collaboration with Pathfinder International held a one-day inter-faith dialogue Thursday in Abuja to sensitise Nigerians, through faith leaders, on the COVID-19 vaccines.

NIFAA programme manager, Dr. Fatima Mairami, in her welcome address at the session tagged; “Access Project Inter-Faith Town Hall Dialogue”, said some believe that COVID was gone, but that it was very much around, changed lives, and was still doing a lot of harm to its victims.

She said: “The COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to help fight the virus, but unfortunately, the uptake is low in Nigeria due to several misconceptions; and NIFAA is holding this meeting to get faith leaders more informed to clarify their doubts and dispel the rumours scaring people away.

“Part of the objective of this event is to achieve high acceptance of the recommended COVID-19 vaccinations and have more people take it by sensitising faith leaders on the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, and they are expected to take the message back to their congregants,” she added.

The meeting urged leaders of faith communities to ensure they pass the right information about COVID-19 vaccines to their members as an act of love, since they will be protecting themselves and others around them.

“Faith leaders should take ownership of the process, empower and equip themselves with the necessary information, live by example, motivate people around them, be an advocate by utilizing every opportunity given to sensitize members on COVID-19 vaccine; be innovative and creative such as using focus group discussion, drama, brief presentation, on COVID-19,” she said.

killing in the name of Biafra,"By Fredrick Nwabufo

Killing, killing, killing in the name of Biafra! When did murder become typical of the Igbo stock? When did taking innocent lives become classic in Igbo land? In Igbo cosmology, murder, ‘Igbu oshu’ is a cardinal sin deserving of banishment. A murderer is banished from the community and the land is cleansed of the abomination.

Have the Igbo settled for this governing abomination? Have the elders been functionally vasectomised? How can murder, anarchy, and fear reign in the land uncontested? Have we become a people given to bloodletting, beheading and cannibalism? Have we gone backwards in our evolution as a humane and cosmopolitan people to become savages?

Why has this cumulus of evil persisted and remained hanging over an entire region? A region that was once prosperous, peaceful and bubbling on the growth index is now a slaughterhouse that investors are running away from. The south-east is being destroyed by the same people who claim to be fighting for the people.

Security agents have been killed. Traditional rulers have been killed. Men have been killed and women have been raped and killed by this band of parademons. A few days ago, ‘’unknown gunmen’’ attacked a police station and killed three policemen in Ebonyi. Last week, gunmen killed seven community leaders in Imo. And the killings persist.

There is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.

It has now become customary for residents of the south-east to wake up to severed heads dangling from poles in market squares, roads and community facilities. An unsleeping evil has taken over the land.

On Wednesday, these ‘’unknown gunmen’’ invaded a cattle market at Omumauzor; a community in Ukwa West LGA of Abia. The market is said to be peopled by Nigerians from the north. They came not to buy cattle, but to kill. By the time they were done, eight citizens were dead. These parademons did not spare anything, they killed cattle and set the market ablaze. What sort of bestiality is this?

According to Abia state government, the gunmen struck around 11pm on Tuesday. “On Tuesday, 15th February 2022 at about 11:35pm, some yet-to-be-identified hoodlums allegedly invaded traders at the New Cattle Market located in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of our dear state. We are shocked and saddened by this mindless and barbaric act of violence that claimed the lives of about 8 innocent citizens of our great country and we totally condemn this dastardly act together with its wicked perpetrators,’’ the state government said.

The attack appears to be ethnically-motivated and targeted. This makes it very dangerous. These ravagers are not only threatening the lives of Igbo citizens and other Nigerians in the south-east, they are also jeopardising the safety and security of Igbo citizens in other parts of the country.

As I said in the column, ‘Ndi Igbo stand for One Nigeria’, those crusading for the secession of the south-east today are deficient students of history and sociology. Even the late Odumegwu Ojukwu, the captain of the secessionist struggle during the war, regretted that devastating episode in our history. Ojukwu said: ‘’I don’t think the second war is necessary. We should have learnt from the first one.”

There is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.

The Igbo elite and citizens must take a stand to end this fast descent into utter devastation. Instead of angling for the presidency in 2023, we should work at ending the carnage in our home. Onye ulo ya na-agba oku, anaghi achu oke. Our house is on fire we cannot afford to be chasing a will-o-the-wisp.

The 33-year-old, who is also a sprinter, was expelled from the Tokyo Olympics last year before the women’s 100m semi-finals after testing positive for human growth hormone at an out-of-competition test in Slovakia on July 19.

The AIU in a statement issued on Friday explained why Okagbare was punished with a 10-year ban.

The AIU statement read in part: “The sole arbitrator adjudicating the case concluded that the athlete’s use of multiple prohibited substances as part of an organised doping regimen in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympic Games was egregious conduct that amounted to aggravating circumstances under the Rules thereby warranting an additional period of ineligibility on top of the standard four-year sanction.”

Osinbajo Calls For Imposition Of Severe Costs For Delays In Justice Delivery,"Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for the imposition of severe costs for delays in justice administration and delivery.

The vice-president explained that the court is a taxpayer-funded public resource and the wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the justice system.

According to a statement signed on Saturday by Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, the Vice President said this on Friday night at the 20th year memorial anniversary symposium in honour of a legal luminary, Bankole Olumide Aluko, SAN.

The Vice President, who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy, and digitisation in the judiciary, among others, noted that “the administration of justice system is the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.”

He added that “Severe costs should attend adjournments. There is no greater waste of taxpayer’s funds than for a scheduled case to have to be adjourned. It is only heavy costs that will discourage this malfeasance.”

According to him, addressing delays should “involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.”

“Adverse costs are paid to the successful party in a civil case and wasted costs are directed against legal practitioners for poor professional standards in the conduct of a case.”

Osinbajo said “certainty or predictability of judicial outcomes is one of the major strengths of the common law.”

Regarding the impact of the law on democracy, Osinbajo said that “the democratic rights of the people and their confidence in the notion of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, suffers when the system of electoral justice fails to see itself as a handmaid of the democratic process.”

Citing the decision of the Supreme Court in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State to buttress his point, the VP noted that “to make sense, judicial decisions and reasoning must in most cases meet the common notions of fairness and justice.

“The system of justice must recognize the larger principles that it serves. In judicial interpretation, the spirit is as important as the letter of the law. Otherwise, judicial decisions become technistic applications far removed from common sense.

“The notions of justice that would meet public expectations of fairness and equity are those that promote substance over form. The observance of technicality over merit will always alienate the system of justice from the people it is meant to serve.”

On the expectations from judicial officers, Prof. Osinbajo said “while we ask for the best from our judicial officers, we must equally ensure that the conditions under which they operate are not only befitting but are good enough to attract the best of minds in our profession.”

In addition, the Vice President said the institution and infrastructure remain key to reforming the system, stating that “the judge is, of course, central to how our system of justice works. It is the court, not counsel that must determine the pace of cases.”

On the process for judicial appointments, the VP stated that the robustness and transparency of the processes in other jurisdictions “provide comfort to the candidates of the fairness of the selection process; and enable the public to have front-row seat in some of these processes”, arguing that such a process be replicated in Nigeria.

He, however, assured that the challenges affecting the administration of justice in Nigeria are being addressed, and “there is much hope for the positive reform of the system as more result-oriented work is going on and some real changes expected.”","Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for the imposition of severe costs for delays in justice administration and delivery.
The vice-president explained that the court is a taxpayer-funded public resource and the wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the justice system.
The Vice President, who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy, and digitisation in the judiciary, among others, noted that “the administration of justice system is the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.”He added that “Severe costs should attend adjournments.

Biden Now ‘Convinced’ Russia Will Launch Invasion of Ukraine,"U.S. President Joe Biden says he is now “convinced” Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital, an ominous assessment that emerged as the country’s war-torn east saw more attacks that the West said could be designed to establish a pretext for an attack.

After weeks of saying the U.S. was not sure if Putin had made the final decision, Biden said Friday that his judgment had changed, citing American intelligence.

“As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.”

The president’s comments at the White House followed a day of rising violence that included a humanitarian convoy hit by shelling and a car bombing in the eastern city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian rebels began evacuating civilians from the conflict zone with an announcement that appeared to be part of Moscow’s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats.

Biden reiterated his threat of crushing economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to reconsider. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a steep price for any invasion.

As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a major military push, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.

The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.

Lines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.

Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops now posted around Ukraine’s borders, the long-simmering separatist conflict could provide the spark for a broader attack.

Fears of such escalation intensified amid Friday’s violence. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported.

There were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities.

Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage.

Overall, monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported more than 600 explosions in the war-torn east of Ukraine on Friday.

Separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas announced they were evacuating civilians to Russia.

Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.

Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign could include staged, prerecorded videos.

Authorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own.

Putin ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas region.

By early Saturday, more than 1,100 residents of the rebel-controlled areas arrived in the neighboring Russian region of Rostov, according to the region’s authorities, and thousands more were expected. Separatist officials have said they plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people.

The explosions and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia could use to justify an invasion.

Around the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation.

Ukraine denied planning any offensive.

“We are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is “more complex and probably higher” than during the Cold War. He told a security conference in Munich that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences.

Russia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback and instead observed more troops moving toward the border with Ukraine.

In other developments, the White House and the U.K. formally blamed Russia for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the intrusions, which barraged websites with junk data to make them unreachable.

The Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches.

Asked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that did not materialize, Putin said: “There are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it’s worth.”

“We are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,” he said. “We have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.”

Canada: Police Arrest 100 in Ottawa after 3-week Protest,"Police arrested scores of demonstrators and towed away vehicles Friday in Canada’s besieged capital, and a stream of trucks started leaving under the pressure, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions.

By evening, at least 100 people had been arrested, mostly on mischief charges, and nearly two dozen vehicles had been towed, including all of those blocking one of the city’s major streets, authorities said. One officer had a minor injury, but no protesters were hurt, interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell said.

Police “continue to push forward to take control of our streets,” he said, adding: “We will work day and night until this is completed.”

Those arrested included four protest leaders. One received bail while the others remained jailed.

The crackdown on the self-styled Freedom Convoy began in the morning, when hundreds of police, some in riot gear and some carrying automatic weapons, descended into the protest zone and began leading demonstrators away in handcuffs through the snowy streets as holdout truckers blared their horns.

Tow truck operators — wearing neon-green ski masks, with their companies’ decals taped over on their trucks to conceal their identities — arrived under police escort and started removing the hundreds of big rigs, campers and other vehicles parked shoulder-to-shoulder near Parliament. Police smashed through the door of at least one RV camper before hauling it away.

Scuffles broke out in places, and police repeatedly went nose-to-nose with the protesters and pushed the crowd back amid cries of “Freedom!” and the singing of the national anthem, “O Canada.” Later police on horses were used to push back the crowd for a time.

Police said late in the afternoon that protesters had assaulted officers and tried to take their weapons. Some began dismantling equipment at a stage where they had played music for weeks, saying they didn’t want it to get destroyed.

Many protesters stood their ground in the face of one of the biggest police enforcement actions in Canada’s history, with officers drawn from around the country.

“Freedom was never free,” said trucker Kevin Homaund, of Montreal. “So what if they put the handcuffs on us and they put us in jail?”

But a steady procession of trucks began leaving Parliament Hill in the afternoon.

“There are indications we are now starting to see progress,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.

Police would not disclose how many protesters or vehicles remained downtown. All indications were that police would be working into the weekend to clear the area.

The capital and its paralyzed streets represented the movement’s last stronghold after weeks of demonstrations and blockades that shut down border crossings into the U.S. and created one of the most serious tests yet for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They also shook Canada’s reputation for civility, with some blaming America’s influence.

Authorities had hesitated to move against the protests, in part because of fears of violence. The demonstrations have drawn right-wing extremists and veterans, some of them armed.

With police and the government facing accusations that they let the protests get out of hand, Trudeau on Monday invoked Canada’s Emergencies Act. That gave law enforcement extraordinary authority to declare the blockades illegal, tow away trucks, arrest the drivers, suspend their licenses and freeze their bank accounts.

Ottawa police made their first move to end the occupation late Thursday with the arrest of two key protest leaders. They also sealed off much of the downtown area to outsiders to prevent them from coming to the aid of the protesters.

The emergency act enabled law enforcement authorities to compel tow truck companies to assist. Ottawa police said earlier that they couldn’t find tow truck drivers willing to help because they either sympathized with the movement or feared retaliation.

As police worked to dismantle the siege, Pat King, one of the protest leaders, told truckers, “Please stay peaceful,” while also threatening the livelihoods of the tow truck operators.

“You are committing career suicide,” King warned on Facebook. “We know where the trucks came from.”

King himself was later arrested by officers who surrounded him in his car.

Ottawa police had made it clear for days that they were preparing to retake the streets. On Friday, even as the operation was underway, police issued another round of warnings via social media and loudspeaker, offering protesters one more chance to leave and avoid arrest.

Some locked arms instead as officers formed a line to push them back.

Dan Holland, a protester from London Ontario, packed up his car as police closed in. “I don’t want to get beat up by this police,” he said.

Children bundled up in coats and hats stood amid the crowd. Police said the protesters had put the youngsters in the middle in the confrontation.

The Freedom Convoy demonstrations initially focused on Canada’s vaccine requirement for truckers entering the country but soon morphed into a broad attack on COVID-19 precautions and Trudeau’s government.

Ottawa residents complained of being harassed and intimidated by the truckers and obtained a court injunction to stop their incessant honking.

Trudeau portrayed the protesters as members of a “fringe” element. Canadians have largely embraced the country’s COVID-19 restrictions, with the vast majority vaccinated, including an estimated 90% of the nation’s truckers. Some of the vaccine and mask mandates imposed by the provinces are already falling away rapidly.

The biggest border blockade, at the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, disrupted the flow of auto parts between the two countries and forced the industry to curtail production. Authorities lifted the siege last weekend after arresting dozens of protesters.

The final border blockade, in Manitoba, across from North Dakota, ended peacefully on Wednesday.

WHO Names Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Covid Vaccine Production,"The Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries – Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia – as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.

Ghebreyesus who announced this on Friday at the European Union – African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.

The announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.



The mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.

Instead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern — COVID-19 in this case.

This triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.

Ghebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.



With the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.

President Buhari has since welcomed the development.



In his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.



He expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.

Buhari said: “We shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.”

While commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa’s developmental projections.

“In the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,” Buhari said.



Responding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: “This is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.”

The global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.



Also French President, Emmanuel Macron said: “Improved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.”

On his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together “to build new solutions to protect what is most precious – our health and our lives.” He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.



The WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.

Nigeria: APC Set to Postpone National Convention by Two Weeks,"The National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 may not be held on that day after all.

THISDAY can authoritatively confirm that the convention will be postponed by two weeks.

Efforts to speak to the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, who is also the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, on this latest development proved abortive.

Though there is no formal announcement yet, a very reliable party source informed THISDAY last night that the (CECPC) and the APC governors would meet President Muhammadu Buhari today to propose a new date, which is likely to be March 12.

The source who preferred anonymity said, “The convention has been postponed by two weeks but it is not official yet. The Caretaker Committee and the governors will meet with the President on Saturday (today) to propose the new date.”

Also, a former member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who pleaded for anonymity, said it was already clear that the convention would not hold, “because there are some things that needed to be done for the convention to hold as scheduled on February 26 and most of them had not been done, with few days to February 26.”

The source stressed that, for instance, one of the things that ought to have been done was zoning of party offices.

He continued: “People have not bought forms and people cannot buy form if the zoning is not done; and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don’t know the zoning, you can’t buy a form.

“There are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. I remember that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees beside the main convention committee.”

Reacting to the purported plans by some governors and a principal officer in the Senate to foist Senator Abdulahi Adamu on the party, he said “while individuals or groups can have preference, President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who becomes the next Chairman of the party.

“Whatever you are hearing now are mere speculations because nobody can push anybody. All of them are waiting for the president. Everybody is waiting for the president and that is why until the president says this is the chairman before they can now zone other positions around where he comes from.

“So, they have to know whom; they have to know which zone he is from before they can now zone the remaining offices based on that. But that is not to say that individual governors or some group will not have their preferences. But those cannot mean anything, except such individuals or groups are able to convince the president to now adopt their own.”

"Amaechi’s courage, energy make him best candidate for APC presidential ticket – Princewill","THE courage and energy of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi make him the preferred candidate to clinch the Presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the 2023 election, a former governorship candidate in Rivers State, Tonye Princewill has stated.

Speaking during an interactive meeting with select journalists in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Princewill said it would take a politician of Amaechi’s pedigree to to tackle the myriads of problems confronting the nation.

He further said the former Rivers State Governor is the only credible person that has what it takes to move the country to the next level.

Princewill noted that if performance and the knowledge of Nigeria’s politics were criteria to determine who should be the country’s President in 2023, “then the cap fits Rotimi Amaechi.”

He said that the wealth of experience Amaechi has gathered over the years as two-time speaker, chairman of the Speakers Forum; two-term governor; chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum; ‘’Director-General who sacked a sitting President and the best performing minister makes him the best man for the job.”

Princewill noted that though Amaechi may be stubborn, “he is very stubborn for results. He does not take ‘no’ for an answer. He goes for results and he has always gotten results in anything he sets his eyes on.

He added, “Amaechi took over the moribund railway industry and transformed it to something that we all can be proud of as a people. He may not remember friendship when he becomes President because he needs results that would make Nigerians happy.

Haruna said the group, which comprised youths and women, decided that it was time for a youthful and energetic president to emerge in 2023 in order to tackle the numerous problems confronting the nation.

He further said since Bello was elected governor, he has delivered the dividends of democracy to Kogi residents, especially in the area of human capital development ‘’which was why a lot of Nigerians are urging him to contest for the 2023 presidency.’’

He said, “We are calling on Governor Bello to run for the office of President because at this stage of Nigeria’s existence, we need a youthful leader who is vibrant and has the strength and capacity to take us out of the present situation that we find ourselves in.

“We have mobilized thousands of youths across the North-Central zone and we are making efforts to get more people to join us because we believe that Yahaya Bello is the solution to the problems of Nigeria”.

"Bolt ripping us off, drivers lament","SOME operators of Bolt, an e-hailing service provider, have accused the company of ripping them off.

They accused the company of increasing its commission without notifying the operators.

Some drivers who spoke in separate interviews with our correspondent on Friday said the company has increased its charges from 20 to 25 per cent.

A driver who simply gave his name as Charles said the company should have considered the drivers while implementing their new price regime.

He added that it would have been of benefit to drivers and the company if the fares on trips were jerked up a little, adding that as it is, the drivers would bear the brunt.

Charles said, “We just noticed our trips were not correlating with the amount we usually earn. Then it was 20 per cent on each trip they charged as commission on Bolt. All of a sudden, it was increased to 25 per cent. There was no communication or any notice from them. Several complaints have been made to Bolt but they are yet to give us reasons for their actions.

“That five per cent is a lot. For instance, if they are taking N2, 000 for the whole day, it won’t be a problem, but you are deducting 25 per cent on each trip. We maintain our cars; spare parts are expensive, we fuel our cars, we do most of the work.

“What they are offering is just the platform. They increased the commission and the fare remains the same. We are not against the increase in commission; let it not be a loss on our part. I went to fix my fuel pump on Monday, the price has risen from N8,000 to N20,000.

“On the app at times, you see N20,000 and you would be surprised you may not have more than N8,000 from the N20, 000. This is after deducting their commission, they could remove like N5,000 as commission, now you are left with N15, 000.”

A female Bolt driver, who gave her name simply as Jenny said a lot of benefits that allowed them to earn more had been taken away by the e-hailing company.

She said, “What have drivers done to bolt? They came with a lot of incentives. All of them are no more. Initially they started with 15 per cent incentive; they were giving drivers promo as well as the customers.”

Agreements with Twitter not censorship – FG,"



The Federal Government says the agreements it reached with Twitter to resume operations in the country were not meant to censor the microblogging site and other social media platforms in general.

The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who stated this on Saturday, added that the agreement, to be extended to other social media platforms operating in the country, would ensure that only wholesome content were published by the platforms.

The Minister was speaking on “Radio Link’’, a phone-in programme of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria monitored by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).

He reiterated the resolve of the government to regulate the social media in a manner that would not stifle the freedom of speech and expression, as well as strangulate the media.

“We are going to regulate the social media not because we want to stifle the media or we want to violate the right of expression.

“We want to ensure that only wholesome contents were available on the social media.

“Recently we were all shocked when an 18-year old boy, accused of killing his 21-year old girlfriend for money rituals, confessed that he leant the diabolical act on social media.

“The teenager, in collaboration with his friends, cut off the head of the victim and were burning it in a pot when they were apprehended.

“The government has the responsibility to ensure that social media platforms were responsible and the contents they displayed were not harmful to young people, as well as the unity of the country,’’ he said.

On the other agreements reached with Twitter, which the minister said would be applicable to other online platforms, the micro blogging site had agreed to open its Nigeria office within the first quarter of the 2022.

He said Twitter agreed to appoint a designated country representative within one month of lifting its suspension, while its global policy team will also be available to engage directly with the government

The minister said Twitter agreed to meet all regulatory demands, including the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Nigeria Communication Commission laws and rules and the National Broadcasting Commission Code.

“Twitter also agreed to comply with all payable taxes, as they were operating under Nigerian laws and this they agreed to do within one week of restoring their operations.

“Twitter agreed to immediately work with the federal government in the area of code of conduct, that were in line with global best practices

Twitter agreed to immediately enrol Nigerians in its Law Enforcement portals and Partners Support Portal”.

“The law enforcement portal will provide dedicated channels for the Nigerian law enforcement agencies to escalate reports on contents that violate the code of conduct or national laws.

“Similarly, the partner support portal provides a direct channel for government to engage Twitter staff to manage prohibited contents,” he said.

He reiterated that relevant laws and the broadcasting code would be amended to ensure that the agreement reached with Twitter would be applicable to other social media platforms.

"2023: Buhari, Jonathan tip Anyim for higher responsibilities",".

By Dirisu Yakubu

Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the duo of President Muhammadu Buhari and ex-President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, commended the leadership qualities of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, saying he has all it takes to be entrusted with higher responsibilities in the future.

In their separate remarks at an event in Abuja to honour Anyim on the occasion of his 61st birthday, they described Anyim as a humble leader who sees the entire country as single constituency.

President Buhari, represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, noted that at various times while serving in different capacities, Anyim rose to the challenge of leadership by putting the nation first.

He said: “Senator Pius Anyim is a patriotic Nigerian who always puts his nation first and he is one of stabilizing voices we have today in the politics of our country. This he has demonstrated in a number of times, but the one that stands out and still echoes with me was his insistence that elected officers should always stay a single term and he kept to his word by not seeking for re-election to the Senate, after the expiration of his first term as Senator and Senate President in 2003.

“That many Nigerians cutting across various political divides are gathered here today to celebrate you is a glowing testimony of your contributions to the growth of our nation and its political development,” Buhari stated.

In what would count as an endorsement of Anyim’s 2023 Presidential aspiration, Mustapha added that the experiences garnered over the years by the former Senate President place him at a vantage position to seek a higher political calling.

He continued: “Let me say on a personal note, as the current and 19th SGF that I have drawn a lot from the wealth of wisdom that has been the source of strength and the endowment that Senator Anyim has brought to the fore of governance in this country. We don’t often meet but whenever we meet, we share knowledge about the responsibilities of the office and the enormity of the act of balancing contending forces and interests, that is always vested on any occupant of that office.

“And I want to thank you (Anyim), for the wealth of experience and the depth of knowledge that we have. I made bold to say whoever had occupied the Office of the Secretary to the government for four years In an evolving democracy like Nigeria, with diverse contentious issues, is capable and able to occupy any office,” he added.

Like Buhari, Jonathan described Anyim as a unique leader who never allowed the trappings of office to get into his head.

For Jonathan, the sheer number of people gathered at the International Conference Centre to honour Anyim was an indication of the trust Nigerians reposed in his years after leaving the office as Secretary to the Government of the Federation.

“Some people are very busy and on most Saturdays, some people don’t like to wake up early. For you to have gathered these numbers as early as this time today means a lot.

“We thank God for you today, your wife, your children, all your friends, with all of us here your friends, otherwise, we wouldn’t have been here to celebrate you today. You are a Government somebody that I know a little.

“You were the Senate President when I was the governor of Bayelsa state and I remembered you visited me in the house one day and of course by divine providence, you became the engine of my government as my Secretary to the government of the Federation.

“The first day I became President, Anyim Pius Anyim wanted to be chairman of PDP and he came to me with a lot of dreams and we spoke. I may not bother you with details but he was never the chairman of PDP.

“When he became the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, he did not even come to me with a biscuit but we found him worthy as a Nigerian that had experience in managing systems, managing issues and also somebody who had friends across the country and when we were looking at the person we wanted to be the Secretary to the Government, of course, we wanted somebody from the South-East because PDP then normally made sure that every geo-political zone had one key office. Now, we don’t have enough people, so we don’t have that.

“Up to the time I was the President, something somehow happened in a way that we never expected. The PDP philosophy then was that the President will come from one geo-political zone, the Vice President from one geo-political zone, Secretary to Government from the one-geo political zone, the Chairman of the party from one geo-political, the Senate President from one geo-political zone and the Speaker from one geo-political zone but that was when PDP had a lot of spread across the country.

“Now it is difficult to package that because even the All Progressives Congress, APC doesn’t have that kind of spread. So, it is difficult to get that package. That was very unique and it was a good way of accommodating every section of the country.

“And so we zoned the Secretary to the Government to the South-East. We looked at our brothers and sisters, the characters, and they were very nice people. They had many competent people but let me say that it’s like a lot it fell on Anyim Pius Anyim and we made him the Secretary to the Government. And I don’t regret committing him. He is a very hard working young man, committed to serving this nation and I believe if he has the opportunity to serve more, he can do better,” Jonathan said.

At 61, Anyim is a bridge between the old and the young and that fact was not lost on Jonathan when he said: “Today, we are celebrating a young man but you are getting old now. At 61 years, you are no longer very young but you are willing to serve and as somebody who has served at the parliament as a Senate President, at the executive level as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, it is quite tasking.

“Having served in that position (SGF) for the period, I know he is fully baked and I didn’t receive too many complaints. You know as a President, every day you receive complaints from those who work for you- the ministers, your aides, advisers, assistants and so on. I didn’t receive too many complaints about Anyim Pius Anyim,” he added.

Former Vice President, Namadi Sambo who came with Jonathan also took to the podium to pour encomiums on the celebrant, saying, “his leadership stabilized the Senate and we must be grateful for that. He was a team player who worked towards a prosperous nation. He can be trusted with higher political responsibility in the future.”

Former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Bello Adoke in his goodwill message described Anyim as ‘a team player, a humble leader that is always ready to take on any task for the good of his country.”

Also speaking, former governor of Abia state, Sen. Theodore Orji said at 61, Anyim has a lot still to give to his fatherland. “If you look at the age he started, you will know that God has not finished with him,” he stated.

"UK returns Benin bronze cockerel, Oba head worth £2.5 million","The Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, yesterday received during a colourful ceremony at his palace in the Edo State capital, two stolen artifacts: Cockerel (Okpa) and Uhunwun Elao (Oba head) from Europe, worth £2.5 million.

The artifacts were handed over to the first-class monarch by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Mr. Tunji Ishola, on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, 125 years after they were looted from the Benin palace.

Ishola disclosed that the two artifacts were preserved in their original forms, while the value of the Cockerel today was put at £2 million, with the Oba head valued at £500,000.

The high commissioner stated that he was directed by President Buhari to hand over the artifacts to the Oba of Benin.

Ishola hailed the British government for preserving the artifacts in their original forms, while disclosing that efforts were still on to make sure that many of the stolen artifacts were returned to Benin’s palace.

The two artifacts, out of the no fewer than ten thousand, which were taken from the palace of Oba of Benin during the British expedition of 1897, were returned by Jesus College of Cambridge University and University of Aberdeen, Scotland.

Besides Ishola, the event was also attended by the Director General, National Commission of Museums and Monuments (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani; eminent Benin sons and daughters; prominent traditional rulers; security chiefs and other distinguished personalities.

Tijani, in his remarks, stated that it was historical that the artifacts were returned in his tenure, while many attempts in the past were frustrated by the holding countries.

He said: “I have on many occasions met the holders (of the artifacts) and told them that the Benin artifacts were not artworks, but life arts and part of the history of Benin people, not works for commercial value or aesthetics.

“We are making history, because none of us was here when the artifacts were taken away in 1897, but we are here to receive them. I have already scheduled to visit other countries in Europe, to convince the holders to return them.”

While receiving the artifacts, Oba of Benin, whose speech was presented by his younger brother, Prince Aghatise Erediauwa, stated that the artifacts transcend mere art, but mostly of religious significance, while the two bronzes would return to where they rightly belonged.

He said: “We are witnessing today the beginning of the restitution of our artifacts, which were looted in 1897. Contrary to reports that the military expedition of 1897 was a retaliation for the killing of some British soldiers, the truth is that there was a calculated and a deliberately conceived plan to attack Benin for its territorial dominance and also for her treasures.

“The result was a destruction of a civilisation, which equalled or even surpassed that of the aggressors. It was thought that the kingdom (Benin), totally decimated and in ruins in the aftermath of the war, would not rise again. By the grace of God and our ancestors, we are still standing.”

The Benin monarch also hailed President Buhari for taking keen interest in the repatriation of the artifacts, while pleading with persons who were genuinely interested in the cause to join him, in the interest of peace, tranquility and the substance of Benin cultural heritage.","The Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, yesterday received during a colourful ceremony at his palace in the Edo State capital, two stolen artifacts: Cockerel (Okpa) and Uhunwun Elao (Oba head) from Europe, worth £2.5 million.

"PDP defies Police in Calabar, flags-off by-election campaign","The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State has defied the Police in Calabar, the state capital as it flagged-off campaign for the by-elections to fill the vacant seats in the Ogoja/Yala Federal constituency and the Akpabuyo State Constituency. This was just as Rivers State governor, Nyesome Wike, pledged his full support for the party in order to help it win the by-elections fixed for February 26. Wike was a Special guest of honour at the party’s rally on Saturday.

Impressed by the huge crowd that attended the rally in the state capital and the fact that they defied an attempt by the Police to stop the rally, Wike declared that he was convinced that the PDP was still firmly rooted in the state. “Be rest assured that I will give the PDP in the state my full support to ensure you win in the by-election and in 2023 elections. Don’t allow APC intimidate you.”

He said it was unfortunate and shameful for anyone to try to intimidate members of PDP by using security operatives to stop a rally for ordinary federal and state constituency by-elections. Wike added that any government that had done well would not use such a gimmick in its bid to stop a rally unless they were not confident or had not done well for the people. He alleged that the ruling APC was afraid of signing the electoral bill into law because they were afraid of transmission of results and the level of transparency the act would guarantee.

His words : “Why on earth will they try stop an ordinary rally if they have done well, this is just by- elections for federal and state constituency ,what if it was the governorship ,what would they have done ? If they had succeeded in stopping us from holding the rally, that would have been the end of the party in Cross River ,but we are very resilient people.

“2023 is not 2019 ,PDP means business ,we are taking over Cross River State , go out and get your PVCs ,make sure you vote and also make sure you guide and protect your vote, it is obvious that you are ready to take over Cross River once again. Do not be afraid ,they tried it in Rivers State , but we resisted them , it is just a form of intimidation , I thought the only way to test the people is to allow them to hold their rally whether they would come or not ,but with the crowd here ,it shows that things are not well with them ( APC).

“With the by- elections, they will know and understand that it is no longer business as usual ,indeed we will leave no stone unturned , we must defeat APC, forget about presidential ambition we must win this first ,” he said. Speaking earlier the Chairman of PDP in Cross River, Venatius Ikem Esq, expressed satisfaction over the patience by party stalwarts adding that they tried to stop them but it did not work.

Nigeria needs more rebels to move forward – Obasanjo,"Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that Nigeria requires honest people as rebels to move her forward.

Obasanjo said people who live life of honesty and integrity have to also be rebels, explaining that life of honesty and integrity embolden one to speak truth to power, not caring a hoot whose ox is gored.

The elder statesman spoke yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, at the unveiling of the autobiography of the Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, as part of the celebration of his(Sowunmi) 80th birthday.

The autobiography titled “Footprints Of A Rebel,” was reviewed by Hafsat Abiola – Costello, daughter of the late politician, MKO Abiola, and founder of Kudirat Initiative for Democracy.

According to Obasanjo, having honest people as rebels remained one of the greatest assets for rebuilding a nation.

He lauded the octogenarian and former activist for living an exemplary life worthy of emulation by the younger generation.

“Looking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel? But it is good.

“But the truth is that if you have to leave a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel. There would be some time you would be asked to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that, you will become a rebel. You may even become a persona non grata.

“There is no country that we can call our own except Nigeria. Our country, Nigeria, needs more rebels. Those who would look at things straight in the face and say ‘this is not good for Nigeria,” Obasanjo said.

"CAN endorses Sanwo-Olu for second term, says performance outstanding","For the giant strides recorded in Lagos State in the last three years, the Body of Christ in the state has publicly thrown its weight behind Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, endorsing the governor for a second term.

At the 2022 Inter-Denominational Divine Service organised by the Lagos Chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Christian body was unequivocal in its endorsement of the governor for a second term, as it described the Sanwo-Olu administration as one that is “consciously pragmatic and proactive.”

CAN added that the governor, in his administrative style, has sustained and built on the culture of excellent governance bequeathed to the public sector in the state by his predecessors, especially the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

For this reason, the Body of Christ in Lagos wants Sanwo-Olu to return for a second term.

Christian leaders from all denominations in the membership of CAN in Lagos were present at the event held at The Apostolic Church (LAWNA) Territorial Headquarters in Ketu with the theme: “Choose You This Day Whom You Will Serve.”

CAN chairman, Rt. Reverend Stephen Adegbite, who described Sanwo-Olu as “a child of God,” said the governor’s programmes and projects had been felt across all sectors, adding that the governor had been delivering on his administration’s development blueprint with fear of God.

He said: “Sanwo-Olu is a child of God and when you have a child of God at the helm of affairs, all you get is excellent results. The blind can see the developments going on in Lagos and the determination of the governor to consolidate on the THEMES Agenda. The governor has been wonderful and we are seeing progress across all sectors.

“Given the governor’s outstanding performance, the Body of Christ in Lagos State is saying unequivocally that one good turn deserves another. Since we do not change a winning team, let us all pray and support this performing, pragmatic, wonderful, ever-consciously proactive, people-oriented and God-fearing Government to continue for a second term.”

Adegbite hailed the governor and his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, for upholding synergy and harmony in administering the affairs of the state. He also praised the First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, and wife of the Deputy Governor for supporting their husbands with various projects.

The Lagos CAN chairman also gave a tacit endorsement of the presidential ambition of Tinubu, saying the country would be in for a new and better country if Tinubu was allowed to have a shot at the presidency and replicate Lagos progress at the national level.

“We all know there is a bigger project being pursued in Lagos State at the national level and if we see a replication of what is happening in Lagos at the national level, definitely Nigeria would be a better place for all to dwell in,” Adegbite said.

In acceptance, Sanwo-Olu, who was in attendance at the event, expressed the faith that the CAN endorsement came on the heels of the group’s dispassionate assessment of his administration’s achievements.

The Governor said his purpose in Government was to offer his physical strength and intellect to uplift conditions of the people, stressing that no service would be greater and pleasing to God than serving mankind.

Sanwo-Olu said: “Our covenant with God is to serve the people and give our best ability in the period we have been chosen to serve. Indeed, we appreciate the support and prayers of the Christian body.”","For the giant strides recorded in Lagos State in the last three years, the Body of Christ in the state has publicly thrown its weight behind Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, endorsing the governor for a second term.

Osinbajo Seeks Award Of Severe Costs For Justice Delay,"Challenges affecting the administration of justice in Nigeria are being addressed with much hope for positive reform as more result-oriented work is in progress with expected changes, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said.

He said addressing delays in the administration of justice should involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.

Prof. Osinbajo spoke at the 20th memorial anniversary symposium in honour of a legal practitioner, Mr. Bankole Olumide Aluko, (SAN) themed, “Administration of Justice: the Ideal Standard, the Nigeria Reality and Our Potential” on Friday.

A statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, said the vice president who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy and digitisation in the judiciary among others, noted that the administration of justice system was the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.

“The court is a taxpayer-funded public resource. The wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the system.

“Adverse costs are paid to the successful party in a civil case and wasted costs are directed against legal practitioners for poor professional standards in the conduct of a case.

“Severe costs should attend adjournments, there is no greater waste of taxpayer’s funds than for a scheduled case to have to be adjourned. It is only heavy costs that will discourage this malfeasance.”

He noted that certainty or predictability of judicial outcomes is one of the major strengths of the common law.

Regarding the impact of the law on democracy, Osinbajo noted that the democratic rights of the people and their confidence in the notion of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, suffers when the system of electoral justice fails to see itself as a handmaid of the democratic process.

Citing the decision of the Supreme Court in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State to buttress his point, he noted that to make sense, judicial decisions and reasoning must in most cases meet the common notions of fairness and justice.

“The system of justice must recognise the larger principles that it serves. In judicial interpretation, the spirit is as important as the letter of the law. Otherwise, judicial decisions become technistic applications far removed from common sense.

“The notions of justice that would meet public expectations of fairness and equity are those that promote substance over form. The observance of technicality over merit will always alienate the system of justice from the people it is meant to serve,” he said.

On the expectations from judicial officers, Prof. Osinbajo said “while we ask for the best from our judicial officers, we must equally ensure that the conditions under which they operate are not only befitting but are good enough to attract the best of minds in our profession.”","He said addressing delays in the administration of justice should involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.

2023 presidency: Bayelsa traditional rulers root for Osinbajo,"By Chijioke Okoronkwo

The Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council on Saturday said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has the potential to be a good president.

King Malla Sasime, Vice Chairman, Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council, expressed this view while receiving Osinbajo who paid a courtesy call on traditional rulers at the Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council Secretariat on Saturday in Yenagoa.

Osinbajo was in Bayelsa to perform the groundbreaking of the construction of Angiama-Oporoma Bridge, which will link Yenagoa, Capital of Bayelsa, and the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area.

The traditional ruler thanked Osinbajo for the visit and implored him to maintain the cordial relationship with the state.

“Vice President, your name has been called for very good reasons; and the reason why your name has been on is maybe people think that you have been very good and we appreciate your efforts in governance.

“If you come out for president, you will be a good material as those rumours are all over the place in the social media.

“So, we thank you for being a good vice president; we hope that you keep your relationship with Bayelsa in very good stead; thank you very much,’’ he said.

Responding, Osinbajo, who was accompanied by Gov. Douye Diri, thanked Sasime for his kind welcome and reception.

He said that he was in the state to identify with developmental projects of the governor in collaboration with the Federal Government.

“As you have heard, I am here at the invitation of my brother, the Governor of Bayelsa, to celebrate the second year anniversary of his government and also to look at some of the works that are going as well as perform the groundbreaking of a very important project.

“We will be driving in a few minutes on the Yenagoa-Oporoma-Ukubie road; and thereafter, we will be performing the groundbreaking of the Angiama-Oporoma Bridge–which are very crucial projects.

“I am sure you all know how important that road project is; and how several governments have worked on it including the immediate past governor of the state.

“They have done their own bit up to a point and in the true tradition of continuum of the government, the current governor is set to complete the project and to ensure that he made available to the good people of Bayelsa, especially many of these communities that will benefit significantly from this.’’

According to the vice president, the project is an evidence of the collaboration between the federal and state governments.

He said that President Muhammadu Buhari had shown by his openness, by his desire to ensure that despite political differences, every state in Nigeria benefits fairly and justly.

“By making sure that as this road has been built, the Federal Government refunded the cost of the project so far and will continue to refund.

“So, essentially, what we are seeing here is collaboration between the state and the Federal Governments for the benefit of the good people of Bayelsa.

“I think that this is the way it must be; at the end of the day, political differences do not matter to our people; what our people want is the same thing everywhere across the country.

“They want good roads; they want good infrastructure; they want an enabling environment to be able to do their businesses; they want good health facilities; good social facilities; and that’s what really the Federal Government is determined to do.’’

Osinbajo said he was happy that the Federal Government had a partner in the government of Bayelsa, led by Diri.

He said sure desires could only be achieved if everyone works together, the federal, state, local governments working together.

“The politicians and technocrats are working together to ensure that we achieve the same objective.”

He thanked the governor for the warm welcome and for the nice Ijaw outfit that he (Osinbajo) wore.

“When you look at this outfit, you would imagine that this is what I wear everyday; it is well made but it is courtesy of my dear brother, Diri.

“He is the one that made sure that I am appropriately attired.

“All, I can say to him is that he has to make me a few more because after people have seen this, they expect me to show up more often in this outfit.

“So, I want to thank you very much your Royal Majesties and thank the good people of Bayelsa for the warm welcome,’’ he said.

Osinbajo was earlier presented with a traditional gift — a walking stick — to match the Ijaw traditional attire he adorned. (NAN)","By Chijioke OkoronkwoThe Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council on Saturday said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has the potential to be a good president.

"We’re living in squalor, we need help, Okobaba inmates cry out","Lara Adejoro

The Okobaba Destitute Home, located in Ebute Metta, Lagos, was established in the early ’90s by a former military administrator of Lagos State, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd.) The home popularly known as ‘beggars colony’ was established to provide shelter and succour to the needy, majority of whom are living with health and physical deformities. Among the inmates are lepers, the blind and the crippled. The Okobaba Destitute Home has, however, become not just a filthy overcrowded squalor but also a haven for infections. LARA ADEJORO reports:

Debris, pet bottles, metals, papers, takeaway plates litter the compound with offensive stenches oozing out—all in piles, mountains-high at times. Those are the features that jump at any first-timer at the Okobaba Destitute Home, in Nigeria’s megacity, Lagos.

The home established alongside three other rehabilitation settlements in the early ’90s by the Lagos State Government is now in deplorable condition with many of the inmates equally in a poor state.

Also, almost permanently etched on the faces of the inmates is worry. No first-time visitors to the home will miss this. Looking at the inmates, you can almost feel how palpably affected and worried they are by their conditions.

Another thing that stares the first-time visitor in the face is the level of overcrowding. The congestion of humans in the small abode will instantly heighten the prospect of the rapid spread of respiratory infections, cholera, diarrhoea—for the visitors and the residents.

Filth lurks around from the compound and the shanties that dot the camp. The gutters are clogged with dark, thick, dirty water, leftover foods, and floating human feaces.

The residents have become accustomed to breathing in the smelly putrid and deadly air as most of them grew up in the environment. They now see the offensive odour as a normal part of life as they seat under canopies in the scorching sun, though most of them are not oblivious of their plight in Africa’s economic hub.

However, for daily survival, their expectation is that Non-Governmental Organisations and humanitarian bodies will visit to support them, give them food, and clothes.

Located in the heart of Lagos in Ebute Metta, a neighbourhood of Lagos Mainland, Okobaba Destitute Home houses over 2,000 vulnerable people, including the blind, the crippled, the lepers.

There appears no reason to call it home. Flies from open defecation and over-flowing latrines buzz about, perching on their food. Or, rather, the food brought to them—because they can’t afford cooking. And if they cook, they do it in the open.

As the state population grows, so does the number of destitute in the small corners they cram into. And as the population grows, so too does the demand for more rooms, comfort, good living conditions, and sanitation.

The residents at the destitute home are among the most vulnerable in Nigeria and the most neglected—in one swoop. Even among the destitute homes, Okobaba Destitute Home is a glaring victim of inequality. Their counterparts at Majidun fare much better. Yet they both caught the government’s attention once in the past. The Okobaba Destitute Home is surely not feeling the impact of government.

Yet, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had pledged to double up interventions to take care of orphans, children with special needs, the elders, the mentally challenged, and other vulnerable groups in the state.

It could be recalled that the governor, while speaking during the inauguration of the Social Welfare Integrated Programme Initiative in Ikeja recently, had said, “As a Government, we are not going to give excuses, there’s a lot that we can do for the children and vulnerable people out there. And I will personally take the lead and see that we double up our interventions through Ministries of Youth and Social Development, Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, and other MDAs.”

However, his promises seem far-fetched as the conditions of the inmates spell otherwise.

Truncated comfort

With a population of over 2000, five or more people are crammed in each of the 174 rooms in the home.

Most occupants in the rooms tie up their mattresses and mats once they are awake to allow for passage, while clothes are heaped on the floor in the rooms.

Outside the rooms are benches laid with cartons for some to lay their heads because of the lack of ventilation in the rooms.

“I stay here,” a middle-aged man who sells sponges for a living said in Hausa language, pointing at the bench he sleeps on.

“As you can see, there is no ventilation in the rooms and it is always jam-packed, there is no air circulation.

“Some of the rooms here are for the married and some are for singles and you can have from four to six people in a room.

“I’m not the only one who sleeps outside, you need to come here in the night to see what the situation looks like,” the Zamfara state indigene said.

Some jostle for space beside the block of buildings to build shanties with woods and zincs. However, most of those shanties are prone to flood and often collapse during heavy rainfall.

Our correspondent also learnt that the inmates usually open their shelter to others who can’t afford rent in the megacity. This could be contributing to the high level of overcrowding.

To worsen the hygiene situation in the home, just a pit latrine and one bathroom are attached to eleven rooms.

The toilets and bathrooms are in poor shape. Virtually all of them have dirty, soggy floors and broken doors. They are no doubt serious hotbeds of diseases, with an overwhelming stench of feaces, maggots, and flies buzzing around irritatingly. But as irritating as they look, residents of the home were seen going in to answer the call of nature.

According to experts, the poor sanitary conditions of the home pose serious health challenges to residents.

Speaking with PUNCH HealthWise about the situation in the home, a Professor of Public Health and former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria, Tanimola Akande, lamented that the overcrowding of the home is a serious health risk.

“It makes people susceptible to respiratory infections that are easily transmitted from one person to the other like Tuberculosis and skin diseases.

“An unhygienic environment like dirty toilets and bathrooms easily provide room for transmission of infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria as well as fungal infections.

“Diarrhoea diseases and some sexually transmitted infections (not as common as often mentioned by people) can result from dirty, unkempt toilets,” Akande said.

Also, a report by the World Health Organisation, stated that poor sanitation is linked to the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio and exacerbates stunting.

“Poor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety, risk of sexual assault, and lost educational opportunities.

“Inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 432,000 diarrhoeal deaths annually and is a major factor in several neglected tropical diseases, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to malnutrition,” the global health body noted.

Bleak hope

While the majority of the inmates may have adjusted to the harsh reality of their existence, some of them are, however, protesting against the unacceptable condition and lamenting their plight even though they feel helpless about their situation.

It is, however, not in doubt that the majority of them are grappling with dreariness, with the regretful way they speak, especially about the lack of comfort, food, and help.

One of such is Hajia Hawau, who seems to have lost touch with reality. She neither knows her age nor how long she has stayed in the home.

Speaking in the Hausa language, she said she would appreciate any help the government can offer to make life more comfortable for her.

“I need help. I need money. I just want to be fine, anything that the government can do to help me, I will be happy,” she said.

Aisha Nasiru, a mother of five children, is another resident of the home.

The 38-year-old Kano indigene says she would accept any gift that may come her way.

“I’m crippled and I’m from Kano state. I need money to start something, feed my children and take care of myself,” she said.

Alleged tribalism

The General Secretary of the home identified as Mohammed Baba alleged that tribalism discourages the young ones from going to school.

Baba, who is a graduate of the University of Maiduguri said, “Most of the children born here go to primary school but one thing that discourages them from furthering their education is tribalism.

“We’ve been asked by the government that we should train our children in school but tribalism from your people always discourage the children.

“Lagos state offers a free primary school for the pupils. If there is nothing like tribalism, our children would have benefited from it and gone to the university.

“There are some people and even NGOs who are coming to support our children, even to the university; but they cant take care of all the children and we can’t put all the responsibilities on the NGOs. The government should do something,” he said.

Dearth of drugs

However, a visit to the Majidun Rehabilitation and Training Centre located on Isawo Road, Agric, Ikorodu, by PUNCH HealthWise revealed a different narrative compared to the poor state of the Okobaba home.

The environment at the Majidun centre is well-kept, and the place looked organised. Also, the inmates look orderly. Two officials man the gate of the home.

Our correspondent sighted some inmates who were seated at the health facility waiting to receive medical care.

Our correspondent learnt that there are doctors and nurses at the centre who attend to the inmates’ medical needs.

PUNCH HealthWise, however, learnt that some drugs needed by inmates are out of stock at the pharmacy department of the centre.

A list of out-of-stock drugs obtained by our correspondent showed that there are over 20 drugs needed at the centre that are presently not available. They include: Trifluoperazine, Risperidone 2mg, Olanzapine 10mg, Sodium valproate 200mg.

Nevertheless, inmates of the Oko Baba destitute will bless their stars if they enjoyed half of what the Majidun destitute have.

But the Director of Programmes for Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, Mr. Philip Jakpor, says the government should be held responsible for the poor state of rehabilitation homes in the state.

He insisted that it is the responsibility of the Lagos government to make the environment livable for the inmates.

“It is the responsibility of the government which has set up those places to rehabilitate citizens undergoing specific challenges. It is the responsibility of the government to make the conditions of those places livable so that the individuals supposedly rehabilitated do not suffer double jeopardy.

“If the conditions are not made conducive or responsive to the challenges of those they are housed there, these centers may end up churning out broken people who will not only be worse than they got there but also become a menace to the society,” Jakpor said.

PUNCH HealthWise contacted the Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, for comments regarding the state of living of the destitute, but he did not respond to calls or the text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.

"NAFDAC impounds 120 tons of imported ‘ponmo’, arrests seven merchants","Deborah Tolu-Kolawole

The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control said it intercepted in Lagos State, large quantities of dangerous animal hides and skins popularly known as “Ponmo” with seven merchants of the deadly product in the agency’s net.

The Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, however, warned the general public, particularly consumers of Ponmo against the activities of some unscrupulous businessmen and traders who are selling industrial animal hides as food articles.

Adeyeye, in a statement by the Resident Media Consultant to NAFDAC, Sayo Akintola, in Lagos on Sunday, disclosed that NAFDAC Investigation and Enforcement officials carried out intelligence gathering around certain locations where the alleged products were being warehoused and sold.

The statement partly read, “This was in response to several complaints received from the public, pertaining to alleged sale and distribution of imported hides and skins meant for use in leather industries and which had already been processed with industrial chemicals.

These hides and skins are then sold to the unsuspecting public as consumable animal skin products, otherwise called ‘Ponmo’.

“Monitoring was also extended to some buyers who patronise the sellers and custodians of the warehouse,” she said, adding that preliminary investigation revealed that some of the hides and skins were “imported illegally and sometimes diverted to some merchants of death who re-process the hides and skins and further sell them as consumable Ponmo to the public”.

In the light of these discoveries, she said that the agency recently conducted investigative raids upon some identified locations in Lagos State where market women and men were found clustered for the purchase of leftovers from the warehouses.

She disclosed that large quantities (120 tons) of the products were intercepted at six different locations, stressing that seven suspects who were alleged to be involved in the acts are currently under investigation.

The NAFDAC boss further explained that samples of the products have been sent to the laboratory for testing to ascertain the quality and unwholesomeness of the products.

According to her, the intervention would help the Agency deal with the interaction and the dangers associated with the consumption of these products.

“The street value of the product currently intercepted is estimated to be around N25.330m only,” she said.

Adeyeye, however, alerted the general public to the existence of “these merchants of death and their nefarious activities as she warned Nigerians to exercise caution when buying animal hides, popularly known as Ponmo”.

“NAFDAC wishes to advise consumers and retailers of Ponmo not to patronise importers of hides and skins for consumable animal skins,” she added.

NDLEA intercepts $4.7million counterfeit cash in Abuja,"**Arrests nursing mum 3 weeks after bail on same drug offence

By Kingsley Omonobi

The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, an Sunday disclosed that its operatives have foiled the attempt by a syndicate to steal at least N2.7 billion from the Nigerian economy by pushing into circulation fake $4.7 million cash.

The operatives had in the early hours of Friday 18th February 2022 intercepted a consignment sent from Lagos to Abuja at Abaji area of the Federal Capital Territory.

A controlled delivery of the parcelled counterfeit US dollars totaling $4, 760, 000.00 led to the arrest of a principal suspect, 52-year-old Abdulmumini Maikasuwa.

The seizure followed intelligence received by the FCT Command of the Agency detailing the movement of the cash and the vehicle conveying it.

Meanwhile, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has directed that both the cash and the suspect in custody be transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for further investigation.

In Kwara state, barely three weeks after a nursing mother, Mrs. Rashidat Adebayo, 38, was granted administrative bail following her arrest for dealing in illicit drugs, operatives have again arrested her in Offa with assorted drugs such as Tramadol, Swinol, Diazepam and Pentazocine injection ampules.

Before her latest arrest on Thursday 17th February, the nursing mother had been arrested and granted bail on 24th January 2022 for dealing in similar drugs.

In the same vein, NDLEA officers have arrested two drug dealers: Sani Isa (aka Bilaz) and Bala Yerima in Hong, Adamawa state with 239 blocks of cannabis sativa weighing 209kg, just as operatives of the Bauchi state Command have intercepted a truck marked FFF 422 XB coming from Lagos to Maiduguri, at Azare, Bauchi.

A statement by Femi Babafemi, Director of Media and Advocacy said “A total of 164.8kg of cannabis sativa concealed in peak milk cartons was recovered from the truck”.

The NDLEA Chief Executive has commended the officers and men of the FCT Command for their vigilance and preventing counterfeit $4.7 million from going into the streets.

He charged them and their counterparts in Adamawa, Kwara, Bauchi and others across the country not to rest on their oars.

Investing in people ‘ll hasten Nigeria’s devt — Bawa Garba,".

By Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo

Founder of the first Satellite TV in Northern Nigeria, Alhaji Bawa Garba, ABG, has said Nigeria’s future will be bright if the country invests in its population by way of developing human capital.

He spoke Kaduna at a ceremony organized to mark his 80th birthday anniversary.

ABG who initiated the first-ever Kaduna International Trade Fair explained that developing human capacity towards achieving a set goal and objectives in productive service to mankind and country had been his business philosophy.

He said that a productive population would ensure a bright and secure future for the upcoming generations.

ABG unveiled a plan to establish a fertilizer blending plant in Kaduna which he assured would provide jobs for thousands of Nigerians.

A retired Commissioner of Police, Garba Galadima, during the occasion, paid glowing tributes to ABG, describing him as a principled man of commendable virtues.

He said ABG was always on the lookout for allies, attending to their needs and above all proffering solutions to problems where they existed.

Galadima who was in his eighties also was in charge of the police force in Kaduna between 1986 and 1989, a period he recalled with nostalgia were most memorable in his career courtesy of the CEO of ABG Communication.

He revealed that the home of the celebrant was amongst the earliest points of call where he held a public outing, a wedding ceremony he stated was tumultuous and warm.

He said that despite being away from his state of origin and new in Kaduna, the philanthropist made him feel very much at home.

One of the children of Alhaji Bawa Garba, Hon. Shehu Bawa (ABG) who represented Kaduna North in the House of Reps between 2011 and 2015, was full of eulogies for a father who he said sacrificed all to ensure he and his siblings acquire the best of education for service to the country and humanity.

He described the patriarch of the family as a disciplinarian, a stickler to moral upright and a caring father to all his children, whom he said would rather forgo personal interests for sake of the ABG clan.

Children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the octogenarian took turns to eulogize the celebrant, wishing him more happy years in service to Allah and mankind.","By Ibrahim Hassan-WuyoFounder of the first Satellite TV in Northern Nigeria, Alhaji Bawa Garba, ABG, has said Nigeria’s future will be bright if the country invests in its population by way of developing human capital.

2023: ‘How Jonathan can be Nigeria’s president again’,"Dr. Goodluck Jonathan

By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja

Ahead of next year’s general election, an Abuja-based pro-democracy and good governance advocacy group has asked former President Goodluck Jonathan to close ranks with President Muhammadu Buhari and join the ruling All Progressives Congress APC with a view to getting the party’s presidential ticket.

The Citizens Network for Peace and Development gave the charge Sunday in Abuja at a media parley on the state of the nation.

National Coordinator of the network, Okorie ‘Ohamadike’ Raphael who spoke on behalf of the group noted that Nigeria deserves a leader who is respected even beyond her borders and who is convinced that his ambition is not worth the blood of any Nigerian.

According to him, Jonathan’s bloodless ambition puts him in a vantage position over and above those who see politics as a do or die affair.

He said; “The 2023 elections in our opinion, is not about the politicians. It is about the citizenry, the Nigerian people! It is about us and our desire for continuity and sustainability of the democratic gains.

“This briefing is not for lamentations, nor is it centred on disparaging the image of any Nigerian. However, in the past few days, a few personages have indicated interest in running for the Office of the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023.

“Over the years, it has been an all-comers affair. The process of election or is it ‘selection’ of our leaders past has glaringly never really been based on the will of the people; rather it has been mostly predicated on the design of the elites whose motive is targeted at manipulating the system personal benefit or that of their minions. Such though is the game of politics but I dare say that we have all had enough of that.

“Having carefully scanned the political firmament in search of a credible, knowledgeable, selfless, trusted and patriotic candidate to occupy the exalted position of President of Nigeria. It is not in doubt that Nigeria is at a crossroads between discontent, fear and suspicion and the propensity for peace, reconciliation and hope. Our searchlight has fallen on none other than former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan GCFR. His antecedents speak volumes. His compassion and passion for peace and Nigeria’s development cannot be overlooked.

“Those who vigorously criticized his administration and misunderstood his conciliatory and transformative approach to governance have soon realized that his patriotism and love for Nigeria is unflinching. For President Goodluck Jonathan he has shown that the interest of the Nigeria comes first. This was demonstrated by his actions during and in the aftermath of the 2015 Elections, specifically the historic phone call he made to President Mohammadu Buhari. He has indeed proven to be a peace maker and patriotic. He epitomises a true defender of democracy. His exemplary display of political solidarity and commitment to the progress of Nigeria has earned him crucial international roles as special envoy, mediator and resource person in global governance and security. He has also represented the African Union, ECOWAS and other global organizations in political matters especially election monitoring, reconciliation and peacemaking across the continent. This can be attributed to his sterling leadership qualities and character.

“Looking closer home, Goodluck Jonathan’s track record as an achiever, nationalist and visionary leader are clearly evident around us. A good number of megaprojects initiated by his administration litter the horizon and though quite a number stand today in credit to the present administration in the spirit of continuity, the fact remains that he has left indelible footprints in the sands of time.

“Presently, the distrust in the polity requires a tested Nigerian like Jonathan to bridge the gap and foreclose any suspicion as is the case with some of those that have indicated interest in occupying Aso Rock come 2023. We do not need a leader who is coming onboard with hangers-on who at best will constitute themselves into a nuisance and unwanted distraction. We do not need a leader whose history is chequered with more questions than answers and we certainly do not need a leader whose ambition is just to be President and nothing more”, he added.

Nigeria’s judiciary open to initiatives – CJN tells US delegation,"The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon (Dr) Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad has clarified that the country’s judiciary is open to initiatives aimed at improving and strengthening the capacity of judicial officers in the handling of cases on emerging crime trend in the country.

Justice Muhammad made the clarification at the weekend, in Abuja, while playing host to a visiting delegation of the United States officials led by the Ambassador to Nigeria, Ms. Mary Beth Leonard.

The CJN’s remark at the occasion was made public on Sunday by Mr Ahuraka Yusuf Isah, Senior Special Assistant on Media to the CJN.

Some of those emerging crimes, the CJN said include cybercrime, cross-jurisdictional infringement of Intellectual property rights, and cases related to cybersecurity and espionage.

The CJN added that judges in the country require training on block technology and online dispute resolution as it affects e-commerce which is becoming a challenge due to inadequate awareness of technology and technical abilities and capacity.

The CJN requested for workshops that would border on Copyright Law in the new digital environment for judicial officers and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards relating to intellectual property disputes.

‘’Capacity building for our judicial officers is our priority, while the development of the capacity of our Research Assistants and other staff of the National Judicial Institute, who are fully involved in these training programmes, is also very important.

“Your Excellency, without taking the cat out of your bag, I want to assure you that our doors are always wide open to welcome proposals that will be beneficial to the development of the Rule of Law and the overall growth of the Judiciary of this country.

“The National Judicial Institute will never relent in its efforts to serve as the principal focal point of judicial activities on issues relating to the promotion of efficiency, uniformity and improvement in the quality of judicial services in our courts’’, the CJN stated.

The U.S. Ambassador said, ‘’this courtesy call is an opportunity to encourage the Nigerian Judiciary to continue collaborating with the United States Mission, including in raising the profile of intellectual property (IP) protection which is essential for Nigeria’s development and international partnerships’’.

The U.S., she said, was looking to increase its capacity-building engagement on cybersecurity issues, adding that her country is interested in continued collaboration with the Judiciary and courts through its International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office (INL) and Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT).

Ms. Leonard hinted that the U.S. was exploring how best to support Nigeria’s judicial processes during the 2023 elections.

The Justices of the Supreme Court, who accompanied the CJN to receive the U.S. delegation are Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, Inyang John Okoro, Amina Adamu Augie, Ejembi Eko, Uwani Musa Abba-Aji, M.L.Garba, H.M. Ogunwumiju, Abdu Aboki, Adamu Jauro and Emmanuel A. Agim.

Nicholas John: South Africa police make promise after death of Nigerian,"The South African police have vowed to ensure the safety of Nigerians residing in the country, after the latest round of mob attacks that left a Nigerian, Nicholas John, dead.

The police made the promise when the leadership of the Nigeria Union South Africa (NUSA), led by Mr Collins Mgbo, its President, met stakeholders at Kimberley district in Northern Cape, South Africa, where a Nigerian died, after a mob attack.

Mgbo said in a statement from Pretoria on Sunday that the meeting was attended by Head of Kimberley Police Cluster, Brig. Rikhostso, the host community, representatives of religious organisations and the South African widow of late Mr John.

John’s widow was identified as Ms. Caroline Chikoma, who is currently nursing a 4-month-old baby.

Mgbo revealed that the aim of the meeting was to appeal to the police to ensure that justice was served in the tragic assault on John and for his killers to be brought to book.

Mgbo said, “Secondly, the meeting was able to establish a structure or team, comprising the police, Nigerians, churches and other migrant community organisations.

“The responsibility of this group is to make sure that information is sent across to the police whenever there is a crisis so that the police can handle the matter quickly before it gets out of control.

“The police have promised the Nigerian community that they’ll make sure their lives and properties are protected.”

FBI vs Hushpuppi: FG told to extradite Abba Kyari to US after NDLEA arrest,"Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has urged the Federal Government of Nigeria to allow the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari, to be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over the hushpuppi scandal.

Recall that the FBI is prosecuting Ramon Abbas, a.k.a. Hushpuppi, for charges bordering on Business Email Compromise (BEC) and money laundering.

In August 2021, the FBI asked Nigeria to hand Kyari over to them.

Last Monday, Kyari and others were arrested by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for alleged links with an international narcotics cartel.

On Thursday, the Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the officers indicted for links with the international drug cartel.

“DCP Abba Kyari, who prior to this allegation was on suspension, shall remain so,” the PSC wrote.

Earlier, the anti-narcotics agency revealed the statements Kyari made to undercover operatives investigating the cocaine seizure.

Reacting to the development, Ohanaeze, in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, advised the FG not to let Kyari remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by the NDLEA.

The statement read, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has warned that the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari should never be allowed to remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by NDLEA, with overwhelming evidence of complicity in drugs-related cases.

“Rather than keeping him here in Nigeria, he should be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from FBI over the hushpuppi scandal and criminal activities.

“DCP Abba Kyari should be allowed to face his crimes in the United States. This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.

“The activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.

“The overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect’s belongings and cash is second to none; that’s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.”

“There is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari. Nemesis is hunting Kyari. Nigerians want a thorough investigation of the alleged criminal indictment of Abba Kyari and subsequent extradition to the United States.”","In August 2021, the FBI asked Nigeria to hand Kyari over to them.

The government also announced that markets, parks and offices would be closed while movement of persons and vehicles would be restricted from 8am to 4pm except for those on essential duties.

A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information, Steve Oruruo explained: “The Enugu State Government (ENSG) wishes to notify the public that Local Government elections will hold on Wednesday, February 23, 2022, across the state.

“Consequently, the Government has declared a statewide work free day on Wednesday, February 23, from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. to allow the people exercise their constitutional suffrage.

“During this period, markets and offices shall be closed and movement of persons and vehicles restricted, except for those on essential duties.

“All residents legally qualified to vote are therefore encouraged to go to the polls and cast their ballots.

“The state government, in its unflinching commitment to safeguarding and strengthening our democracy, has made requisite arrangements to guarantee a hitch-free process”.

However, the main opposition party in Enugu the All Progressives Congress (APC) has vowed to get legal backing to void the exercise if the Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) conducts it without listing its candidates in the ballot. Read Also: ‘Anambra poll success boosted INEC’s confidence’ The party, which had raised the alarm over alleged exclusion of its candidates from participating in the poll, alleged that it had been stopped from participating because the list of her candidates were not published by the electoral body.

The party accused ENSIEC of deliberate plot to disenfranchise the party faithful by refusing to publish a list of 260 councillorship and 17 chairmanship candidates it forwarded to the electoral body in December 2021.

Addressing the disenfranchised candidates and other party faithful at the State Secretariat at the weekend, Enugu APC chairman, Barr Ugochukwu Agballah, declared that the party would void the election should the electoral body exclude APC from participating in the exercise.

“Enugu must rise for democracy to thrive. There is no democracy in Enugu State; it’s been a government of cronyism and elitism… On Wednesday (February 23) the local government election will not be held; if they go ahead, it will be an exercise in futility,” he declared.

Agballah announced that the legal team of the party, led by a senior advocate of Nigeria, SAN had already filed a suit at the State High Court to void the election for unlawful exclusion, which he said was a breach of the Nigerian Constitution and the Electoral Act.

The APC chairman accused the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government in the state of colluding with some unscrupulous elements in the APC to manipulate ENSIEC in order to frustrate APC from participating in the council poll.

Agballah, who received his certificate of Returns from the APC national leadership on February 14, 2022, claimed that his emergence as the APC chairman in the state was causing fears within the ranks of the State Government and the ruling party who he accused of having been in the practice of writing election results in favour of the ruling party where they give themselves 100 percent victory in previous LG polls.

“ENSIEC disenfranchised all our candidates. We had our primaries to elect our chairmanship and councillorship candidates on December 18 and 19, 2021. We submitted the list to ENSIEC, which it accepted.","The Enugu State Government has announced that council polls will hold next.

"Drama as Niger Councillor chases govt officials with dogs, thugs","The Councillor representing Tundun Wada Ward in Chachanga local government area, Ibrahim Mai Farare, has chased away officials of the Niger State Environment Protection Agency (NSEPA) with dogs and thugs for inviting him to answer some questions on a proposed gas plant he is setting up within the community.

The Councillor is having a running battle with members of his ward over the proposed gas plant.

Residents in the community had called on the government and relevant agencies to put a stop to the plant, claiming it would be dangerous to safety in the community.

- Advertisement -

They argued there could be explosion owing to the many commercial activities in the community that require fire.

When The Nation visited the community, it was observed most traders fry beans and cheese with many bakeries and suya sellers also around.

To douse raging tension, some officials of the Niger State Environment Protection Agency met the Councillor with a letter of invitation last week.

But they were chased away by dogs and thugs who beat them up.

Although the Councillor did not reply to calls by The Nation, he confirmed the development on a live radio show on Crusaders Radio in Minna.

When asked about the incident on air, the Councillor said: “Yes, I killed them, I did not only pursue them, I killed them.”

One of the residents of the community, Usman Galadima Mohammed, who called in on the live show, also confirmed the incident.

He said thugs beat the NSEPA staff mercilessly before dogs chased them away.

A top Senior Official of NSEPA told The Nation in confidence that the agency has charged the Councillor to the court, describing him as too arrogant and a village champion.

The Official disclosed that there is no approval for the setting up of a gas plant in the community.

Some of the residents however claimed that the Councillor is not the owner of the gas plant but protecting the owner after allegedly collecting N200,000.

Nigeria needs more rebels to move forward – Obasanjo,"Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that Nigeria requires honest people as rebels to move her forward.

Obasanjo said people who live life of honesty and integrity have to also be rebels, explaining that life of honesty and integrity embolden one to speak truth to power, not caring a hoot whose ox is gored.

The elder statesman spoke yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, at the unveiling of the autobiography of the Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, as part of the celebration of his(Sowunmi) 80th birthday.

The autobiography titled “Footprints Of A Rebel,” was reviewed by Hafsat Abiola – Costello, daughter of the late politician, MKO Abiola, and founder of Kudirat Initiative for Democracy.

According to Obasanjo, having honest people as rebels remained one of the greatest assets for rebuilding a nation.

He lauded the octogenarian and former activist for living an exemplary life worthy of emulation by the younger generation.

“Looking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel? But it is good.

“But the truth is that if you have to leave a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel. There would be some time you would be asked to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that, you will become a rebel. You may even become a persona non grata.

“There is no country that we can call our own except Nigeria. Our country, Nigeria, needs more rebels. Those who would look at things straight in the face and say ‘this is not good for Nigeria,” Obasanjo said.

"APC convention: Govs split, may revolt against Buni committee","By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation and Jide Orintunsin, Abuja

Confusion over aspirants’ letter demanding postponement

Party fails to set up convention sub-committees

State chairmen go underground over moves to replace coordinator

The cloud over the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 hung still last night with the party’s governors split into two camps.

The issues in contention are whether the convention should proceed as scheduled and which of the six geo-political zones should produce the party’s next national chairman.

Adding to the uncertainties was the emergence of a letter yesterday by some party members seeking offices at the convention to propose the postponement of the meeting.

- Advertisement -

Some party office holders dissociated themselves from the letter.

It was also gathered that many state chairmen of the party have gone underground to resist an attempt to coerce them to sign a document on convention shift.

This development, sources told The Nation, prompted the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to conclude plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno) with his Taraba State counterpart to force others in line to endorse postponement.

The pro-shift governors are said to have proposed that the CECPC should keep running the affairs of the party until after the conduct of the primaries for the 2023 polls.

The same forces have been trying in the last 72 hours to force the state chairmen of APC chapters to sign a communiqué to demand the postponement of the convention.

Most of the chairmen have gone underground to resist the coercion to sign a document on convention shift.

The governors also remain divided over the zone that will produce the next national chairman of the party.

Although the governors had conceded the slot to the North-Central, some governors reneged and opted to prevail on a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, from the North-East.

Most of the governors have however rejected the Dogara option by insisting on conceding the office to North-Central.

Investigation by our correspondent revealed that most members of the Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni subscribed to the postponement of the convention, but it has been difficult for the committee to table it before the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF).

It was learnt that the committee was afraid of a ‘likely revolt’ against the Buni-led committee.

Attempts by some governors to prevail on state APC chairmen to call for the postponement of the convention have also failed.

Most of the party chairmen at the state level are said to have “gone underground.”

Some governors supporting the retention of the Caretaker Committee and the postponement of the convention have not been able to gain the control of the PGF to achieve their aim.

A governor, who spoke in confidence, said: “The battle at hand is for the soul of the party. The CECPC members including Buni are in support of the postponement of the convention. It is emerging to all of us that Buni appears interested in the presidency in 2023.

“Buni’s personal, vaulting ambition is what’s driving him, but he doesn’t know how to even discuss this with us – his supposed allies who put him on the job

“All the governors are opposed to convention shift except Yahaya Bello (Kogi), who is a presidential aspirant, Hope Uzodinma (Imo) and Ben Ayade (Cross River).

“These anti-convention governors cannot constitute themselves into Progressive Governors Forum (PGF). They are in the minority and they don’t even want the same thing.

“One wants to be President, the other (Uzodinma) wants to be vice president to a Northern candidate. What unites them is that they are not keen on the unity of APC but they will eventually lose out.

“We are 22 and they are either three or four. We know the President will go by the position of the majority because he is democratic.

“Up till now, they cannot officially announce a postponement because they know the President’s position. Instead, they are using sleight of hand. They are in charge. If they want a postponement, why hide behind one finger?”

Responding to a question, the governor said Buni and the CECPC were in a fix.

The governor added: “Mai Mala cannot do it (postponement) because he knows the views of the majority of governors including first term governors. They were trying to play a divide and rule card between first and second term governors but we insisted that the right thing must be done.”

A party source claimed that most state APC chairmen have gone underground to avoid being forced to sign any communiqué for the postponement of the convention.

It was also confirmed by another governor that all his colleagues have directed their party chairmen “not to endorse any document on postponement of the convention.”

“I think those who may have signed are those from Taraba, Yobe, Kogi and Imo states. Others have gone underground, having been directed by their governors to ignore convention postponement drive.

“In frustration, the CECPC has concluded plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno) with his counterpart from Taraba State, Tukur El-Sudi Ibrahim, to pave the way for the postponement of the convention to March 12 or indefinitely.

“Yet all the state APC chairmen came together to elect their leaders through a democratic process. Why will the CECPC be making moves to remove Dalori if they have nothing to hide?”

Findings confirmed that governors were divided over zoning of the office of the national chairman of APC.

It was gathered that before President Muhammadu Buhari travelled to Brussels, he had built consensus among the governors to concede the office to the North-Central.

Some governors however reneged on the pact by shopping for a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, as the next APC national chairman.

An APC governor simply said: “Mark my words; our next Chairman is from the North-Central.

“Mai Mala should go back home and concentrate on his job as governor.”

Aspirants in letter to CECPC, seek shift of convention

A forum of aspirants for offices at the convention yesterday sparked a fresh confusion in the party when they wrote an open letter to the CECPC to shift the Congress.

The shift, according to them, is for the sake of peace, unity and success of the party in next year’s elections.

In the letter signed by Maxwell Yakubu Gowon, an aspirant for National Youth Leader and Chairman of All Aspirants Forum, and Hon. Mohammed Bala Mohammed, an aspirant for National Secretary who also doubles as Secretary for the Forum, the forum claimed that the Abdullahi Adamu led Reconciliatory Committee failed in its assignment, leaving the party divided down the line.

The forum said the committee “complicated the issues at stake by refusing to look at issues holistically and relied on rumours and hearsays in coming to a conclusion in its report.”

It added: “The implication of the above statement is that those that were meant to be reconciled ended up infuriated by the actions of the reconciliatory committee.

“The signs in this regard are evident for every well-meaning member of the APC to see. But they have elected in their wisdom to downplay these contentious issues in the report submitted.

“This, in our opinion, is a great disservice to your efforts at positioning the APC for electoral success. As you may be aware, the public space has been flooded with narratives that paint the APC as a party of strange bedfellows whose interests are propelled primarily for self-aggrandizement.

“Mr Chairman may wish to critically examine the various agitations in the different states in the country. The feelers are not pleasant, and with the benefit of hindsight, it would indeed spell doom if the party goes ahead with the national convention under such circumstances.

“As a party, we must be mindful of the burden of expectation placed on our shoulders in providing credible leadership to the country.

“Suppose we can’t put our house in order. In that case, we do not have any moral justification for promising the country credible leadership because charity must begin from home.”

Chairmanship aspirants distance themselves from letter

Some national chairmanship aspirants however distanced themselves from the letter.

Contacted on the phone, one of the chairmanship aspirants, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, said: “I am not aware of any forum, neither am I aware of any letter advising the Caretaker Committee Chairman to postpone the convention.”

Also reacting to our correspondent’s enquiry, another chairmanship hopeful, Malam Saliu Mustapha, who spoke through the Media Coordinator of his Campaign Organisation, Dapo Okubanjo, said: “We are not aware of the existence of the so-called All Aspirants Forum headed by an aspirant for the position of National Youth leader. So they can’t claim to be speaking for all aspirants, especially as we have never been invited to any meeting where such a decision was said to have been reached.

“We respect and trust the capacity of the leadership of the party to deal with the issues at stake,” Mustapha maintained.

Chief Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe, another chairmanship aspirant, said: “While conceding to the fact that we are in a democracy and everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I make bold to say that problems will always exist and healing them is a process.

“Leadership at all levels is a continuum, and if anyone claims that we must clear everything, reconcile every difference before proceeding, we will be making a big error.

“The idea of continuity is to state all pending issues in your handover note.

“I want to appeal to the Gov Mai Mala Buni led CECPC to have that in their minds and decide on the next line of action which I believe should be by tomorrow evening, Sunday the 20th of February.

“Having said that, we must remember that our word should be our bond; they (CECPC) chose the date of 26th February on their own and should not lose their sense of integrity by doing something that will bring their integrity to question.”

Convention sub-committees yet to be constituted

Members of the party waited in vain again yesterday for the constitution of the sub-committees for the convention.

The Caretaker Committee at its 19th regular meeting of 19th January 2022 had fixed Saturday 19th February for the release of the membership of the sub-committees and their inauguration.

The caretaker committee also fixed the same day as the last day for the submission of nomination forms by all aspirants.

There were no activities suggestive of an upcoming convention at party’s national secretariat in Abuja yesterday.

No member of the Caretaker Committee was even seen at the secretariat.","This development, sources told The Nation, prompted the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to conclude plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon.

"2023 presidency: Why move to lure Jonathan into APC will fail – Aminu Wali, former Foreign Affairs minister","From Desmond Mgboh, Kano

Ambassador Aminu Wali is Nigeria’s former minister of Foreign Affairs and a founding father of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

In this chat with Sunday Sun in his home in Kano, he speaks about the challenges and fortunes of his party, the PDP.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Specifically, he talked about the party’s Northwest congress, which has been shifted twice as a result of disruption in the first instance and recently, as a result of an injunction against a rather popular candidate in the race, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo.

He also lamented over the negative impacts of the Kwankwasiyya Movement – a Movement led by Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso – on the party, the overarching pressure brought by strong governors on the PDP, the moves to lure Jonathan to APC as well as the dilemma of the PDP regarding which zone, North or South, should produce its 2023 presidential candidate. Excerpts:

Let’s start the interview with the efforts of your party to hold a congress in the Northwest zone. What is your impression of what has happened so far, with two postponement of the congress already?

It is unfortunate about what has happened, that has led to the postponement of the scheduled congress. I think luckily, what we have in place today in terms of the national leadership of our party is a leadership that looks at things fairly, that is fair to everybody. It is unfortunate that some people went and got an injunction against one of the candidates, for which they know that they cannot expel or they cannot suspend him. Legally, they don’t have the authority under the Constitution of the party to suspend or expel a member of the BOT. The constitution is very clear. Even the National Executive Committee of the party cannot suspend or expel a member of the BOT of the party.

Are you referring to Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo, the candidate that was barred by their injunction?

Yes, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo. As you know, Gwarzo is a member of the BOT and the Constitution of the PDP is very clear and by the end of the day, it is only the convention that can expel or suspend him or the BOT itself that can suspend him. And if it is expulsion, it is the convention that can expel him. So, this is a Kangaroo thing that was done. But then, when a court gave an injunction to stop Gwarzo from contesting, the party felt that the premise upon which the injunction was secured may not have taken into consideration the Constitution of the party and the party said well, to be fair to everybody, the congress is postponed, so that the legal issues would be sorted out and thereafter, we can go back to have a zonal congress. That is what happened.

What I worry here is time. Does your party have all the time?

Well, yes! Don’t forget that there is already a caretaker executive in place at the zone, which has been handling all the issues. But of course, that is not satisfactory. We certainly want an elected body to do it, but since the current leadership is very much aware of the legal implications, it decided to say okay we cannot just go and support what we know is not legal – that is to support one of the candidates. But since the court has made a pronouncement, we have to obey the court. But for that purpose, they said okay, let’s just suspend the zonal congress so that everybody would be given a fair and level playing ground.

Still on the aborted Northwest zonal congress of your party, there are two candidates from Kano State vying for the deputy chairman. Why is it that almost all of you, the major stakeholders of the party in the zone are opposed the Kwankwassiya candidate?

Don’t forget that I am one of the founding fathers of this party. I was the first deputy national chairman of the PDP. Solomon Lar was chairman and I was his deputy. For me, it is the party that I know. Any other identification within the party, to me, is unacceptable. Our loyalties should be to the party. So, you can see, even without me giving any explanation, you can see why we are running at parallel lines with that movement you just mentioned. I don’t belong to any movement. I belong to the PDP. And any other body that identifies with me, it is not me as a person, It is the party that he identifies. So, somehow, somehow, there is a movement that sprang up around a particular personality, but they still claim to be a part of the PDP.

Sir, from your rich experiences in party politics, what is your take on movements loyal to a particular individual emerging within parties? I mean a movement like Kwankwasiyya Movement, whose loyalty is first to a particular personality?

Well, you see once we have the right leadership leading any political party, this kind of thing would not happen or would not be allowed to happen. This is because there would be limit, a red line which every member of the party cannot cross. But unfortunately, we have not been that cohesive at the national level of the party for some time now. But thank God, for the first time since the departure of Solomon Lar, this current leadership of the PDP, the national leader of the party, happens to be one of the founding fathers of the party. And so, he knows the principles and the basic philosophy of the party and also what really brought people together to form the PDP. At least, he has a perception of what the PDP should be. And I don’t think he would tolerate this movement stuff, I don’t think he would tolerate anything meddling into the administration of the party- like having a different movement whose loyalty is not to the party leadership. For us, the national party leader is our sole leader. No more, no less! Nobody who is not elected within the hierarchy of the party can be a leader to me. Whatever movement it is, regardless, should not arrogate itself the authority that can compete or disregard the party national leadership- because this is what is happening.

You don’t like talking about the Kwankwasiyya Movement, but it is real. How would you access their impact on the PDP in Kano State and beyond? Have they added value to the party or have been a cross for the party to bear?

I think that, initially, when they started, some people took them in good faith. They saw them as members of the party. And felt innocently that it was not really built around a particular individual. They saw it like another brand to bring people into the PDP and they were somehow okay with it, but unfortunately as it turned out, it turned out like a cult within the PDP. And that has not augured well for the PDP in the state and beyond. Initially when it was looked at as nothing harmless, yes, it added value. Kids, one way or the other, wanted to be identified with the PDP if they wear one thing or the other. But as it is, it seems that it is now built around a particular individual as opposed to around the party. If it is around the party, by now everybody who is a member of the PDP would be wearing or would be identified with the colours. But no! It got to a point where it is operating like worshipping the leader of the movement. Number two, it contradicts every democratic norm, all the democratic norms of running, not even a party, but any society of people. If there is democracy, then everybody will and should have a voice. At whatever level, there cannot be only one person that can determine everything. So, that is the difference. So, for Kano today, if things go the way it is going, I will be very, very sorry for our young people that are now coming up. The political culture that is being nurtured in the party would not augur well in the future because number one, discipline is broken down. I have been a victim. I am sure you know what happened to me. In a society, no matter what, respect for elders is always inculcated in the youth. And they have always respected that. That is how our society was and any society in Nigeria is built around that culture. But eventually that culture of respect in Kano is being eroded arising from the emergence of this sort of movements.

There is a new PDP national leadership today. Do you see this team of leadership as the type that can fight APC and their incumbency to a standstill by 2023?

Absolutely, absolutely. Like I said earlier, the spirit of the founding fathers of the PDP is now brought to the fore. The founding fathers of the party fought the military and succeeded, let alone fighting a rival democratic institution like the APC and its incumbency. We were there before and we know how the game is played. The current leadership was part and parcel of the first PDP government. Iyorchia Ayu was a minister in that government. So, he knows the values and the programmes and the achievements of the PDP within that 16 years of governance and today, he is at the helm of affairs of the party. And I believe that very soon, we would start seeing a lot of people, a lot of Nigerians trooping back to the PDP because a lot of people have a lot of confidence in Ayu’s emergence. Like I said, I have absolute confidence in Ayu- because we worked with him in the national secretariat, he was a member of the 34, he was first Chairman’s Political Adviser when I was Deputy Chairman to Solomon Lar. He was his Principle Political Adviser. And most of the political thinking of that era owe itself to Ayu’s input. So he is very much conversant, in fact, he is the most qualified person within the PDP to really drive the new vision of the party. The previous leadership of the PDP led by Secondus.

They are still around, they are still agitating and they still feel that they should not have been removed they way they were removed. Don’t you see them as a threat to all these goals and new vision?

Whether we like it or not, I was party to the emergence of that administration. Secondus was at my house where he was interviewed by all the stakeholders of my zone (Northwest zone) before we agreed to go along with him. At that time, we all believed that things would work out well. But I think that somehow, along the way, there was a derailment. PDP is people’s democratic party. It is not owned by any individual or organization. It is our own, all of us, all Nigerians, and whoever wants to identify with the PDP, owns a piece of the party. And there is a constitution which was carefully crafted by people who are well qualified and with amendments here and there as we go on. For the PDP to succeed, we have to adhere strictly to the constitution of the party. But unfortunately, the last administration vied away from the basic principles of the constitution of the party. In fact, if they had adhered strictly to the constitution of the party, then, movements like Kwankwasiyya could not been tolerated. The constitution does not provide for any movement within the party. But somehow, it was tolerated and encouraged. When Kwankwassiyya movement came out from the APC to the PDP in Kano State, they came in as Kwankwassiyya Movement. That would not have happened under the current leadership. If you come in, you come in as a member of the PDP and your movement is something that is totally outside the party structure. So, my vision of the current leadership or my confidence in the current leadership is to the effect that I know that the driver is a good driver and would take us safely to our destination. My only appeal is to those aspirants for political offices, particularly aspirants to the number one position to please tread carefully, for the party to come up with the right kind of person that is generally accepted, both within the party and across the country.

There is the assumption that the PDP is now under the control of some strong governors, strong governors like Wike and his friend in Sokoto, Tambuwal, and that these governors dictate the tune and not the elected leadership. May we have your view on this?

This is a very sad situation. But it evolved over the years. It would be unfair to blame the last administration alone. PDP started stumbling within the first administration. If I could remember, a lot of the provisions within the constitution and the way that the PDP was being run were taken from the former parties, particularly the NPN of which I was part of. The party, from what I know of the NPN, the party is supreme. Whether you are the governor or the president, you have to go with what the party dictates, when I say the party, I mean everybody, not a certain group of individuals sitting down to decide. But unfortunately, over the years – maybe it is as a result of lack of resources or the party was unable to create ways of raising its own resources and it was depending on the largesse that was coming from the governors and even from the presidency as it was when we were in power. Eventually, through the process, the party began to lose its grips. Because when we came into office in 1999, as a member of the national caucus, we used to meet every week when we first started, every week with the president and his ministers and his nominees, BOT, every week and get reports of what the government was doing. It eventually went to bi-weekly and then somehow along the line, it just fizzled out. That is where I think the party lost track. It didn’t lose track now as in today or yesterday. This problem took time to evolve to what it is today.

What is the solution?

The solution is strong leadership.

And what is your appeal?

Let us now learn to be fair to one another, whether you are the governor or the chairman of the PDP or whatever. Let us be fair to the party and the only way to be fair to each other is to allow the party and constitution to be referee to all the players. They must give the party the chance to be the referee. Just like in a football game, the referee is the sole authority in the game. And the party should be given the authority to make sure that there is fairness in whatever that is being done. And at the same time, the party should think of how to independently generate funds – I think Ayu has started. I saw him going to visit the national secretariat that we started building some years ago. When that structure in the center of Abuja is completed, I think the party would depend less on any individual for funds.

Only recently, the PDP national chairman paid a visit to Obasanjo to canvas his blessings and invite him to the party, but I think the signal in the media was that Obasanjo turned down the offer to return to the PDP. How do you see this?

No! He did not turn down the offer, it was not a question of turning down. Obasanjo has already made his position clear a long time ago, that he is no longer, I mean, he is now a statesman, not only in Nigeria but in Africa, in fact, in the world. And I worked very closely with Obasanjo when I was in the United Nations and I know the kind of respect that the man commanded at the international level. So, I think that he had realized that at his age, he should not be drawn into party politics and all these things. But deep down, he still cannot acquit himself of his preference. If we sit down , me and him sit down, talking, I still can see the flicker of his preference to PDP than any other party in Nigeria! But for him to now come out and say that I am going to be partisan, some of the assignments and some of the activities that he is undertaking at the moment cannot continue. He has had recognition in Africa, recognition internationally. So, I think he is trying to protect what he has going for him now. His position as a statesman may not be accommodated by the narrowness of a particular political party, but deep inside him, his thinking is definitely PDP.

The PDP appears to be in a dilemma in terms of whose region should produce its presidential candidate, North or South, for the 2023 elections. What is your position?

Well, you see for me, my antecedents are very clear. When we went to the party’s convention in Jos, I was an Ekwueme’s man. I supported him to the end and up to the time the man died, I still maintained that relationship with him. For me, my solution for the Nigeria’s problem at that time was to get an Igbo man to become the president after the civil war, to get an Igbo man to take over the country. My belief was and is still is that if Ekwueme had become the president of Nigeria, all these Biafra stuff would have been long forgotten. All these things would have been put to rest, if only we had allowed an Igbo presidency at that time. If we had Ekwueme then as president, nobody would come and agitate for Biafra today. Yes, maybe the Yourba was shortchanged when Abiola was not sworn in, but that is one thing you and me cannot be accused of. But today what we need, from my point of view, what I believe is that we need a change of government in Nigeria, we need the PDP back to power to take us back to eight years ago, where the APC took over because things have really gone bad, things have become so bad in this country in every aspect.

We are talking about that we need…?

Yes, we need to win 2023 general elections and for me, I don’t care where the person comes from so long as the person is capable and can win elections for our party. It should be somebody that can break the barriers of all the zones in this country to be able to emerge as a presidential candidate. There is demand for Igbo president, Yoruba president or a Northern president or whatever president. Yes it is a legitimate right for everybody to voice out his preference, but I hope that within the PDP, we are going to come back to our senses and really look at the aspirants, sit down to look at them and in the same spirit that we were able to produce the chairman of the party, that same spirit should guide us to produce a winner candidate for the presidency of this country, regardless of where the person comes from.

If I get you right now, the emphasis is how to get a winner kind of candidate?

Exactly, because we we have to do something to get rid of where we are today and then we can now return back to our zoning. I want a winnable candidate from whichever part of the country. Let us accept the candidate so that we can go ahead and win the elections and once we win the elections, then we can now sit down within the PDP and within the larger society also to see how do we now satisfy the aspiration of every Nigerian from every part of the country, maybe come up with a new formula like the initial thinking .Yes the initial thinking was to move rotation to all the six zones and after that , there should be no more rotation. But unfortunately, Obasanjo finished and Yar’dua died. That was what brought about the complications. The people are crying that the North has ruled. Yes, it has ruled. But they had APC and we have PDP. We have ruled for 16 years as PDP, but those 16 years were not from the North. I am trying to justify anything , no ! For now, forget about where the candidate would come from , let us get a winnable candidate.

There is a suggestion that to ease this form of challenge, let’s cut down the tenure to one –tenure stuff, so that the presidency can go easily round to the zones. What is your view on this?

This is something that can be visited and be accepted. Because you see this two term business, once somebody gets to the Villa, he does not want to hear anything that would curtail his tenure. We would now have to have a national consensus across all parties that it should be one term presidency. I am totally in agreement with that. Maybe we make one term – five-year presidency, so that another zone will come and take charge so that this question of “we have been left out” would be over. After that, it is going to be purely on merit. We really have to learn to be Nigerians and to be our brother’s keepers regardless of from whichever part anybody comes from. Like I was saying, I never regretted supporting Ekwueme. I remember Obasanjo came to this house to seek my support and I told him Sir, I have known you before EKwueme, but Ekwueme has been my political soul mate.

There is still this speculation that somehow former President Goodluck Jonathan is still being lured back to the political field and APC may field him as their presidential candidate.

Jonathan is my boss and I served as his minister and I respect him and Jonathan is his own man, his own person. No matter how close we are with him, at the end of the day, that decision is his, not mine , not that of anybody. But as far as I know, he is still a member of the PDP. Yes, he has not been happy, apparently, from the way things were going and that is why he has not been too much involved in the affairs of the PDP. And maybe secondly, he’s got an alternative by being engaged in a lot of these African affairs, moving all over Africa, trying to sort out democratic issues…You want my opinion on what?

Should he move on with the offer or should he not?

I doubt it very much, knowing the man and what he is. I doubt if he would take that offer. I doubt it because I think he is already enjoying tremendous amount of respect, nationally and internationally, that going back, trying to go and start fighting against his own party that brought him up, that I think would be a tall order. I don’t think so, and in particular, for him to go and contest in the APC. For me, I will never forget the vitriolic attacks that we got from the APC, particular on him as a person. They even termed him the sponsor of Boko Haram. Some of us were vilified in our won states. They said that we have recanted our religion because we were supporting Jonathan. My house nearly got burnt at a time. So, he knows all these things that happened and it was not anybody’s doing at that time, but the APC’s doing. So, I don’t think that he would succumb to any pressure from the APC. That is number one. This is all rumour! It is rumour!! But how about the stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress that are gunning for that same position? Are they going to sit down and say okay we accept somebody from outside to come and take it? Does it make sense to you that those gunning for the presidency in APC would come and say okay we are settled for an outsider to come and take over?

It is not your party, but what is your take about the current struggle between Vice President Osinbajo and Bola Tinubu for their party’s presidential ticket?

The truth is that I know less or little about these people, to be honest with you. To some extent, yes I know Bola Tinubu, but Osinbajo, I have never met him since he became the vice president. Even since he became the vice president, I have never met him officially, not even once. So, I am not too much attached to the politics of the Southwest and most of the people that I am attached to in the region are not from the APC and even though some of them had moved to the APC from the PDP, when they move, they cut off automatically.

Seven years down the line, how would access President Buhari’s leadership bearing in mind the three major promises that he made to Nigerians when he was canvassing votes?

This administration took over from us and I know how far we went… all those projects that they are now claiming that they have done. Yes, we initiated them. Even the institution fighting corruption, it is our making. On security, what will I say? Let you or any other Nigerian compare between then and now. I don’t have to comment. This is something which is known to all Nigerians. Today, no part of Nigeria is spared. At least in our days, maybe we can say that it was limited to the Northeast But today, no part of Nigeria as far as security is related is secured. People dare not travel by road today to any part of Nigeria. Talking about security, I don’t want to comment. In those days, we all travel by road. But today the roads have all gone bad and secondly you dare not because the roads are not safe. So, what security are you talking about?","From Desmond Mgboh, KanoAmbassador Aminu Wali is Nigeria’s former minister of Foreign Affairs and a founding father of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

"Contaminated fuel: Season of pain, sorrow","• Affected filling stations confused on how to evacuate adulterated petrol imported from Belgium

• Motorists, commuters suffer as product price skyrockets

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

By Adewale Sanyaolu

The recent importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) popularly called petrol said to be high in methanol content has continued to spark outrage across the country over its attendant socio-economic effect on the citizenry.

The development has led to acute shortage of petrol with the majority of depots and filling stations running out of stock.

Motorists now have to keep vigil at filling stations as the price of a litre of petrol has skyrocked to N200 and N400 respectively in Lagos and Abuja.

Commeneting on the development, the Independent Petroleum Marketers

Association of Nigeria (IPMAN)

disclosed that no inland depot has received clean petrol that would boost supply to filling stations.

IPMAN Public Relations Officer, Chinedu Ukadike, said the Federal Government was yet to improve supply, warning that it would take another two

weeks for supply to normalize.

In Abuja, there was no sign of let-up in the shortage of petrol as fewer stations were opened to motorists with black marketers selling at N400 per litre.

Ukadike said that the challenges facing the downstream sector were

enormously, urging the government to begin the process of compensating marketers who have lost a lot of money during the period.

He explained: “Nothing much has changed in the last few days, the issue is that up till now we have not seen the intervention of the NNPC based on evacuating these products (bad fuel) from some of our stations. Some marketers are trying to see if they can get new products and blend it to see if they can move.

“Marketers’ capitals have been tied down and the bad product is also occupying their storage tank and that is why you are seeing some skeletal services. Some also have their tanks quarantined, so it is not easy.

“We have been expecting products in the inland depots like the Port Harcourt Refinery depot but up till now, no product has been received. These things happen. Once there is a break in the supply chain it will take some time to fix. Forget what people are saying, it will take one-two to three weeks to fill in the gaps. It is talking about evacuating and replacing, it is not just about the shortage, it is also about evacuating and replacing.”

He noted that while Port Harcourt where he is based has not witnessed the acute shortage being experienced in many parts of the country, he said most of the marketers who have placed orders have not received the supply.

While urging consumers to be patient, he observed that many motorists have engaged in racketeering where they “fill up their tanks, go to sell to black marketers and return to the queues. I want to advise our people to stop patronizing black marketers, this will help also in solving the problem”, he added.

However, the claim of IPMAN contradicted the position of NNPC which said that it has over one billion litres of certified petrol stock that is safe for use in vehicles and machinery.

The NNPC in a statement released on Tuesday equally said that it has commenced 24-hour operations in NNPC depots and retails outlets to restore normal supply and distribution of petrol across the country.

But, a Twitter user, Anthony Unegbu, while responding to the NNPC statement said that the reality on ground does not support the content of the press statement.

‘‘Why did NNPC depot at Aba not sell even one litre of petrol yesterday (February 15, 2022)? People have payments made since over two months and the tickets have not been released. Prove me wrong by showing pictures,’’ he queried.

There have equally been widespread reported cases of damage to vehicle engines occasioned by the adulterated fuel.

An online video which surfaced recently shows a petrol attendant complaining about how the adulterated petrol dispensed at the station damaged cars and motorcycle engines.

While pointing at some of the grounded vehicles, he said many motorists have reported the matter to the police.

Some of the motorists who spoke to Sunday Sun in separate interviews said, if not urgently addressed, the situation was capable of further pushing more Nigerians below the poverty net.

‘‘Should my vehicle be damaged as a result of this contaminated fuel, who will bail me out? How do I feed my family and other family members that depend on me for survival,” Mufu Akande, a transporter who plies CMS to Ajah queried.

In a telephone interview with Sunday Sun, Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Mr. Babatunde Irukera, while sympatising with those whose vehicles may have been damaged due to the adulterated petrol said that the FCCPC was already in talks with NMDPRA, NNPC, Standards Organisation of Nigeria(SON) on the way forward.

He said that FCCPC will collate data on those affected and develop a methodology on how best to resolve the issue.

He admitted that the issue remained a complicated one, but that the FCCPC will not rest on its oars in order to ensure that consumers are not left in the cold.

The adulterated petrol according to the regulator-Nigerian Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority(NMDPRA) has proved to be high in methanol concentration.

Upon the discovery of the adulterated fuel, NMDPRA in conjunction with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited commenced moves to recall the bad product in order to save Nigerians, especially motorists untold hardship.

But prior to its recall, the adulterated fuel had already found its way into the Nigerian petroleum retail products market.

The outcome of the penetration of the bad product into the Nigerian market was a monumental damage to motor vehicle engines, generators and other mechanical devices that use petrol as its source of energy.

Addressing the media on the adulterated imported petrol, Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of NNPC Limited, Mr Mele Kyari, made a shocking revelation when he admitted that a subsidiary of NNPC, Duke Oil Limited and three other private Nigerian company operating in the downstream sector imported four PMS cargoes which contained methanol.

He listed the three other companies to include; MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.

He said that NNPC investigation revealed the presence of Methanol in four PMS cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando, and Duke Oil.

Kyari added that the adulterated fuel was imported into the country from Antwerp in Belgium with quality inspectors failing to detect the high level of Methanol contained in it, first at the point of import in Belgium and later at the point of arrival in Nigeria.

The NNPC boss who did not give the date of import, however, disclosed that the NNPC found out about the situation late in January following a report received from their quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in PMS cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.

MRS used the vessel, MT Bow Pioneer; Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium imported the product via the vessel MT Tom Hilde; Oando used the vessel MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil imported its PMS using MT Nord Gainer.

Kyari explained that the PMS contained methanol was not detected by checks because the quality checks do not include checks for Methanol percentage, adding that cargoes quality certificates issued at load port (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicated that the gasoline complied with Nigerian specification.

He also said that the NNPC quality inspectors, including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G as well as inspection agents appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority certified that the cargoes met Nigerian specification.","• Affected filling stations confused on how to evacuate adulterated petrol imported from Belgium• Motorists, commuters suffer as product price skyrocketsNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home.

I feel better acting bad girl character,"By Christian Agadibe

Star actress, Chinenye Uyanna always looks stunning acting pregnant woman even though she’s still single.

Recently, Uyanna took to her Instagram page to showcase a baby bump, a role she played in her new movie, Jackie’s Baby Bump. Ironically, in this rare interview, the actress cum movie producer opens up on why she cannot act romantic or sexual roles. Here are excerpts:

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

What are you currently working on?

I am working on having my own production outfit. And I am supposed to start a job on February 12, and I will also be producing a lot of films this year.



What was the first movie you produced?

It’s called Time, starring Mike Ezuronye and a lot of other popular acts. The second one is titled Mended Heart. I also acted in it. Both movies are on TV and YouTube channels. So, I have done three movies. The other one, Baby Bump will come out this month.

Which among these movies is your favourite?

All of them are doing great, even though Mended Heart is doing wonderfully well on YouTube. Of course, all my babies are doing great. My movies are my babies.

Which of the characters gave you a tough time?

I think it is Baby Bump; it is not easy to be pregnant in movies. Carrying that belle for long was really challenging, and the same thing happened in Jackie`s Baby Bump, which would be out in February.

How can you describe the acceptance of the movie?

Time and even Mended Heart are doing great. A lot of people love the storyline as it is all about ‘for better for worse’ between partners, and there are lessons to be learnt. So, I will advise you to go watch it.

How challenging was it producing movies after recovering from the COVID-19 saga?

Really, everything was okay; we kept to the rules, we used hand sanitizer and facemasks.



How do you manage to combine both roles as producer and actor?

It is not that difficult if you have able hands. Uche Ibunabu, my producer really helped. I think people that complain are those that want to carry everything on their heads, there should be people assisting you. So, for me, all I do is bring out the money for the production, then relax and shoot.

What can you say has changed in the industry?

We are growing; it is not how you were as a baby that you are now as an adult. As for me, I’m not sentimental; everyone that comes for my shoot must behave him or herself, even if we are friends or colleagues or family members.

Can you say that young actresses constitute a sort of threat to you?

Nobody is a threat to me. The earth is too big for everybody, and knowing that you cannot be in every movie, but can only do what you can do. What I bring to the table is different from what you bring to the table, so we all have different talents and ideas. Nobody is a threat to me and I am equally not a threat to anybody. I do my thing and focus on myself and work.



What can you say about comedy skits that seem to be taking over Nollywood?

Let’s call a spade a spade. Comedy is comedy. When it comes to comedy, it’s not even up to 10 minutes, it is something to laugh at and move on. But when you want something to learn from, obviously, it’s a movie. Even people no longer pay for cables but go on YouTube to watch their movies. So, we cannot say social media is taking over Nollywood, as it can only take a few minutes of skits. However, both are two different things. I do cartoon skits myself and I know a lot of people don’t know that.

Have you ever done any movie involving romantic or sexual scenes?

I always tell producers not to bother involving me in such movies, because I cannot do it. And I think everybody around me is used to it. If there is no lesson that people can take home from a movie, then there is no need doing it. You know, a lot of people keep complaining about Nollywood films.

Can you say Nollywood films are making an impact in Nigerian politics?

Yes, a lot of things are happening, and thank God for social media, especially during the #EndSARS protest of October 2020. A lot of people came out to lend their voices, including celebrities who used their platforms in terms of speaking out.

Has acting denied you of anything?

Not at all, acting cannot deny me of anything, because my fame came with favours.

Would you encourage any of your children to join the movie industry?

Of course, I would like my daughter to feature in Nollywood if that is what she wants.

What can you say about female celebrities flaunting their big cars, houses on social media?

How do you know I don’t have big cars? That I don’t post things on social media does not mean I do not have something. I don’t need anybody to congratulate me on anything. And I don’t think it’s just me, I think a lot of the male celebrities are also buying big cars, even if they don’t post them. I can even say the actors are doing far better than the female ones; it’s just that we ladies like to show off.



What’s your take on cheating husbands and their wives retaliating by also indulging in extra-marital affairs?

Well, I don’t know about that. For me, I would not do such. We just have to come to terms with whatever situation we find ourselves and have forgiven spirit, realising that nobody is perfect. But if you cannot do that, you move on; marriage is not a do-or-die affair.

Going forward, what should your fans expect from you?

They should expect more films, more endorsements, and more everything good. With God on my side, a lot of good things will happen this year.

What other projects are you into?

I started my Foundation last year and there would be more outreaches this year. My Foundation is about reaching out to children, the young ones and the less privileged. So, you guys should watch out.

We don’t see you nowadays acting the bad girl character, any reason for this?

I do both. I started with the bad girl character. Sometimes I think they just look at your face and know what kind of person you are. I feel I do better when I’m acting the bad girl character, like a nagging wife, a troublesome sister etc.

Can you recall the experience of your first kiss in movies?

No, I can’t remember. How would you even remember something that is just an act?","Recently, Uyanna took to her Instagram page to showcase a baby bump, a role she played in her new movie, Jackie’s Baby Bump.

Uncertainty over APC planned national convention,"From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja

There is indeed uncertainty over the much-awaited National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled to hold on February 26.

Currently, the convention is shrouded in confusion, intrigues and anomie, amidst speculations of its possible postponement from February 26 to the first or second week of March.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

In line with the timetable and schedule of activities released last month January, the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) tactically raised a red flag of possible postponement of the convention when it failed to meet up with its deadline for sale and submission of nomination forms scheduled to hold between February 14 to 19.

Besides the failure to meet up with the deadline for the sale of forms, the national leadership of the ruling party could not equally constitute convention sub-committees, especially the zoning committee, which will swing the pendulum to decide, firstly, the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and ultimately the trajectory for the party’s 2023 presidential ticket.

Although the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) may have temporarily resolved the lingering zoning controversy by giving the national chairmanship ticket to the North-central geopolitical zone, the zoning of the National Secretary to the South-south has been causing serious ripples between the Southeast and South-south.

Explaining the bone of contention to Sunday Sun, a reliable source who declined identity on print, described it as a decision taken in error by a critical stake of the party’s leaders.

Questioning the basis for such decision, he argued that having produced the two previous national chairmen of the party in addition to occupation of the current position as Secretary Caretaker Committee, equity, fairness and natural justice demand that South-south should allow Southeast to produce the next chief scribe of the party in the about-to-be constituted NWC.

“There is likelihood that the convention might be postponed not because of any other thing, but probably because we want to avoid any possible clash with the bye-elections fixed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) coming on the same February 26 date.

“Yes the party has been under immense pressure to shift the date and without ruling out the possibility of the convention still holding as scheduled, I want to say that if there is going to be postponement of the date, the INEC bye-elections might be responsible for it.

“Again, the planned postponement has nothing to do with the lingering controversial issue of zoning or delay in setting up of sub-committees for the convention. For your information, the progressive governors have concluded the zoning arrangement, after their meeting in Abuja last week, by confirming that while the North-central will produce the National Chairman, the Southeast will take the National Secretary.

“They also reconfirmed that all the previous positions in the NWC held by the South should return to the North and vice-versa. However, I must tell you that there has been serious disagreement between South-south and Southeast over which zone should produce the next National Secretary.

“But, having produced two national chairmen of the party previously and currently occupies the Caretaker Committee secretaryship position, South-south should, in the spirit of fairness and equity, allow the Southeast to have the position.

“What it means is that should the North-central produce the party’s national chairman and the South-south the secretary, the Southeast would have lost out in everything should the party also fail to zone the presidential ticket to the Southeast” our source explained.

On why the party’s national leadership reneged in the implementation of its timetable and schedule concerning the sale of forms, our source further argued that there may not be any reason to sell nomination forms to the aspirants to the NWC since most of the positions will be filled through consensus arrangements, adding that the party may sell forms for only non-NWC positions.

“It is wrong to judge the readiness of the national leadership for our convention based on the failure to meet up with the timetable deadline on the sale and submission of nomination forms last week. There is likelihood that the party may not sell nomination forms for the NWC positions because almost all the positions may be through consensus arrangements.

“The nomination forms that might be on sale however could be for the non-NWC positions. Let me add that if the party’s leadership fail nomination forms this week, it will be a confirmation that the convention may not hold this weekend as earlier planned.

“Other factors that might necessitate the postponement of the convention might likely be the INEC bye-elections. As of today, I won’t say with certainty that the February proposed date for the convention is cast in stone. Don’t also forget that the bulk stops on the table of President Muhammadu Buhari. We must look beyond interpretation of his body language as far as this convention is concerned,” the source noted.

Doubting the possibility of the convention holding, many secretariat staff ruled out the February 26 date, arguing that the indices and signals are enough confirmation that the date might be changed.

“I wonder how anybody could still believe the possibility of the convention holding on February 26 with the way the secretariat is looking. There were no preconvention activities in the secretariat one week to the convention. There has not been any composition of sub-committees, acceptable resolutions on the controversial zoning arrangements, and more importantly the nomination forms that have not been printed.

“This secretariat used to be a beehive of activities a week to the convention, but in this case, the only semblance of the possibility of it holding is the marching order President Buhari gave to the Caretaker Committee to organise the convention unfailingly this month. Well, we will, however, get the clearer picture of whether it will hold or not this week,” the secretariat staff noted.","From Romanus Ugwu, AbujaThere is indeed uncertainty over the much-awaited National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled to hold on February 26.

"Osun APC primaries: Oyetola leads, as Aregbesola’s faction kicks","From Lateef Dada and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Barring last minute change, Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State appears set to emerge the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the July governorship election in the state.

Oyetola who contested against the former Secretary to Osun State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, and former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Lasun Yusuf, was leading in the election conducted in all the wards across the 36 local government areas of the state.

Results released in many of the wards as at the time of filing this report showed that Oyetola was leading his opponents with a wide margin.

The former governor and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allegedly absconded from his ward in Ifofin ward 8, Ilesa East Local Government.

Aregbesola who led a faction of the APC, ‘The Osun Progressives (TOP), could not deliver his ward to his announced candidate, Moshood Adeoti. While Oyetola polled 309, Adeoti scored 146 in Aregbesola’s ward.

The Chairman of the APC faction in the ward, Adegoke Saheed, blamed the loss of the ward for the absence of Aregbesola, alleging that the committee favoured Governor Oyetola.

Findings revealed that Oyetola won in almost all the polling centres in the state, defeating both Adeoti and Yusuf.

However, a faction of the party loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, alleged that the election was marred by irregularities.

A statement issued by the publicity secretary of the faction, Mr Abiodun Agboola, alleged that the election was marred by a series of irregularities attributed to the faction loyal to Oyetola.

Agboola said: “We strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.

100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .

“Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, indicated that there were no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.

“Also, there was no proper accreditation in majority of the ward collation centres where voting took place. The accreditation done in some places were skewed in favour of Governor Gboyega Oyetola as members of the group were allowed to pass through accreditation process without much ado.

“Names of a sizeable number of members of the APC who wanted to vote for Adeoti were missing in the register of the party. This we had envisaged by calling for the display of party register before the conduct of the primary.

“We also need to inform the general public that appointees of Governor Oyetola were used as collation officers, which made the rigging plan of Oyetola an easy task. This we strongly condemned yesterday at the stakeholders meeting with the primary committee,” he added.

Meanwhile, Governor Oyetola has expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the ongoing primary election of the party.

The governor who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number, said: “Losing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.”

Oyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji yesterday.

He lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election had testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.

The governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.

Oyetola, however, appealed to the citizens across the state to maintain peace and decorum, adding that elections should not be a battle.

“By the grace of God I will emerge victorious.

Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in the state.

Oyetola was backed by the National Leader of the APC, Senator Bola Tinubu.

This is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party’s National Convention following the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

Oyetola also defeated his main challenger for the APC governorship ticket, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, at Ifofin Ward 8 of the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, in Ilesa East Local Government Area of the state.

The Osun State governor won in Aregbesola’s ward with 309 votes against 146 recorded for Adeoti, the aspirant anointed by Aregbesola.

The two aspirants, who contested with Oyetola were former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yusuff and a former Secretary to the State Government, Adeoti.

Announcing the result in the early hours of today, at the state’s APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Chairman of Osun APC Primary Election Committee and Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, said accredited voters were 247,207 while the total number of votes cast was 235,550.

Oyetola polled 222,169 votes to beat Aregbesola’s candidate, Adeoti, who scored 12,921, while Lasun came a distant third with 460 votes.

Before the primary election, Aregbesola had attacked Oyetola’s main backer and his estranged godfather, Tinubu, telling him that the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be administered on his brother, Oyetola.

However, Aregbesola was absent from the primary election and was said to have left Ilesa for Abuja yesterday morning for unspecified official duty.

While the minister has threatened to explore legal means to obtain justice, alleging that the results of the primary election were “farcically counted in favour of the governor,” Adeoti has vowed to seek Oyetola’s disqualification in court.

Reacting to the election in a statement issued in Osogbo, the state capital yesterday, Adeoti vowed to head to court to challenge what he referred to as “pyrrhic victory” won by Oyetola.

He accused the governor of rigging the election with the apparent backing of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.

Adeoti said the ugly development in Osun APC has sent a wrong signal as to whether the APC has a future in the state.

He also accused Oyetola of using intimidation and violence to ensure that the primary election was not free and fair.

”There was violence in Olorunda Local Government where the Ward 3 Chairman of the Rasaq Salinsile-led APC in Olorunda Local government, Mr. Sala Ademola and his secretary, Mr. Ajisefini were kidnapped. Our supporters were also disenfranchised in all the wards in Ife East by not being accredited and being intimidated with thugs wielding dangerous weapons.”

He also accused a top chieftain of APC of taking over the electioneering process in Ife and halting the accreditation process, sending out his supporter using thugs, while allowing and counting party members from the governor’s group.

The APC governorship aspirant also alleged that the Osun State government procured the services of armed policemen who aided the well-choreographed rigging of the election.

”There was also a massive influx of unregistered members of the party who voted with the connivance of the heavily-compromised National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, of which Oyetola is a member. Overall, there was a massive disenfranchisement of registered APC members in all my strongholds during the so-called primary election.”

He insisted that there was no way any primary election conducted in the state would be fair if Oyetola remains a member of the CECPC.

“Governor Oyetola’s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if allowed to pass us by.

“We are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the Chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.

“We, therefore, express absolute opposition to the outcome of the election because they were chosen by Governor Oyetola. There can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh,” Adeoti explained.

Adeoti argued that Oyetola’s participation in the election was a violation of the provision of Article 31(iii) of the APC Constitution (2014) as amended which says: “Any party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for office he or she is seeking to contest”.

He said the process had been orchestrated from the beginning to manipulate the outcome in favour of Oyetola, which was why the date of the primary was changed from March 5 to February 19.

“We have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022. It is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after a neutral leadership of the party would have emerged,” Adeoti alleged.

He however appealed to his supporters to be calm, vowing to seek a legal redress.

Also reacting in a statement by his media’s aide, Mr. Sola Fasure, the interior minister and Adeoti’s main backer alleged that the results of the governorship primary were “farcically counted in favour of the governor.”

He said: “We have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.

“We have been inundated with reports state-wide of how your names were expunged from the party’s voters’ register, which was not made available until this morning, contrary to the convention of making the list available to the candidates before the election.

“We have heard of how party registration cards were being hawked this morning to the supporters of the state governor.

“You are urged not to take laws into your hands. Please leave the rest to the Almighty God and let us explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice,” Aregbesola explained.

The Publicity Secretary of the Aregbesola-backed faction of the party in the state, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, in a statement issued, said: “We strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola”.

He alleged that there were no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.

The Chairman of the anti-Oyetola faction of the party in the state, Mr. Rasaq Salinsile, who is from Ward 04, Isale-Oba in Iwo Local Government Area also told THISDAY that the election was fraudulent.

Oyetola had expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the primary election.

The governor, who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number said, “losing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.”

Oyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji.

He lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election has testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.

The governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.

“I just want to appeal to all our people across the state to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her right to choose in determining who represents them at the party level and ultimately at the general election,” Oyetola added.

Also commenting on the election, the Chairman of Osun APC Governorship Primary and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRazak, also hailed the peaceful conduct of the exercise.

He applauded APC members for the huge turnout and their peaceful conduct.

He spoke with journalists after monitoring the election in Iragbiji, the hometown of Governor Oyetola.

He said: “If you open the pages of newspapers today, what was painted was a picture of the war in Osun. But the primaries election has been peaceful. I congratulate the people of Osun and all the aspirants. They have all done well.”

Buhari, APC Govs to Decide New Date for National Convention

Meanwhile, President Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party’s National Convention.

THISDAY gathered that this development followed the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the INEC.

A source close to the APC National Caretaker Committee told THISDAY at the weekend that the clash of the proposed convention with the national elections was brought to the attention of the party after it had written to notify INEC of its intention to hold the national convention.

“Elections are national issues that cut across political parties and therefore, it is not expected that party affairs should overshadow national elections. The stakeholders will meet and come up with a new date not beyond two to three weeks,” the source explained

On whether INEC has been notified, the source said that the electoral body would be notified after the proposed meeting between Buhari, the APC governors and the members of the caretaker committee.

"INEC Allays Fears on 2023 Elections, Says No Plan to Shift Polls","* Electoral Bill 2022 still inchoate, commission clarifies

Chuks Okocha in Abuja

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that the 2023 general election is not encumbered and will hold as planned, beginning with the presidential poll scheduled for February 18, 2023.

Responding to speculations that it might postpone the scheduled conduct of the 2023 general election if President Muhammadu Buhari signs the Electoral Bill after February 22, 2022, INEC’s National Commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman of Voter Education, Mr Festus Okoye told THISDAY that the commission was not in any form of dilemma relating to the exercise of its constitutional and legal powers.

Okoye stated that the commission was focused and working proactively to deliver on its mandate.

According to Section 28 (1) of the Electoral Bill 2022, INEC is required to issue a notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election.

The Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, had reportedly stated that in line with the Electoral Bill 2022, the deadline for the commission to issue the notice of election for the 2023 general election will be February 22, 2022, “the reasons being that the total number of days from February 22, 2022, to February 17, 2023, is 360 days.”

But Okoye told THISDAY that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which, according to him, is still inchoate.

According to him, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act.

He insisted that the electoral body was in synch with the constitutional provisions relating to the period for the holding of elections, adding that the provisions are sacrosanct and cast in stone.

“The commission is only permitted to orbit around the constitutional timelines in fixing the date for the holding of elections.

“The commission is a regulatory body guided by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as altered), the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and its Rules, Regulations and Guidelines.

“As of today, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act and the commission will continue to rely on its provisions for electoral continuity, pending any amendment to the said law.

“By the commission’s Regulations and Guidelines made pursuant to the powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the 2023 general election will hold on the 18th of February 2023,” Okoye explained.

He argued that the scheduled date is in consonance and in conformity with sections 132(1) and 178(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that gives the commission the exclusive right and power to appoint the date for the holding of Executive and Legislative Elections subject to the timelines and schedule circumscribed in Sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution.

“By the said sections, election to executive positions shall hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than 10th January 2023 and not later than May 10, 2023.

“By Section 30 of the existing and current Electoral Act, the commission shall give notice of the holding of the elections not later than 90 days to the said election and this remains the law and the commission is in good standing relating to its timelines and schedules,” Okoye added.

The INEC commissioner said that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which is still inchoate.

According to him, Section 28 of the said Bill requires the commission to give notice of election not later than 360 days to the said election, stressing that the said 360 days will elapse in the next few days.

He said that the commission was also aware that Section 58 of the Constitution gives the President 30 days to assent to the Bill or withhold his assent.

“The commission is aware that the Bill was transmitted to the President on January 31, 2022. The members of the National Assembly and the Executive are aware of these timelines in the Bill and the implications of the timelines if the Bill is assented to and these are issues that can be adjusted and streamlined.

“The commission desires an expeditious resolution of the issues surrounding the new electoral legal framework as there are creative and innovative issues and provisions in the Bill that will enhance and advance the electoral process and our democracy.

“The commission is focused and will continue with its preparations for the conduct of the 2023 general election. If there are challenges with timelines, the commission will meet, assess those challenges and remain within the constitutional and legal confines in sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution that requires that elections to executive positions to hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than January 10, 2023, and not later than May 10, 2023,” he explained.

Some civil society groups had declared February 22, 2022, National Day of Protest on the Electoral Bill

The groups said they were aware that the National Assembly transmitted the Bill to the President on January 2022.

They said that they were also aware the Bill allows for electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC’s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.

“The bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.

Accordingly, they said that they have resolved to declare Tuesday, February 22, 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill.

“We urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance”.

The CSOs that signed the statement include Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, and Civil Society, Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC).

Security Agencies Move against Importers of Off-spec Petrol,"*Begin interrogation of suspects

*Despite NNPC’s efforts, petrol queues persist in Abuja, Lagos

Kingsley Nwezeh and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

Security agencies have begun the probe of companies and individuals allegedly involved in the importation of toxic fuel into the country, THISDAY investigation has revealed.

This is coming as many filling stations were still under lock and key in Abuja and Lagos yesterday while the few that were selling petrol had long queues, despite the desperate efforts by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to bring the situation under control in the last one week.

The importation and circulation of adulterated petrol had resulted in damage to vehicle engines across many parts of the country.

It also affected the supply chain, causing long queues in Lagos and Abuja as filling stations shut down to clean up their tanks.

The situation is considered in security circles to have far-reaching economic and security implications.

THISDAY gathered that intelligence agencies invited companies involved in the scam, and they are presently undergoing interrogation.

Presidency sources confirmed to THISDAY that the masterminds of such a deadly importation would be held accountable as heads would roll over the development.

“Security agencies have commenced detailed investigation into circumstances that led to the importation of toxic fuel into the country.

“We are looking at who played what role and who did what. Many heads will roll. So far, all parties concerned are saying what they know. The government is not taking it lightly. Security agencies are on it,” a presidency source told THISDAY.

“It has security and economic implications. Investigations will involve all of them and heads will roll.

“At corporate and individual levels, they are cooperating and providing information about their involvement.

“It’s not out of place to investigate. Do you expect such a thing will happen without investigation when the president has ordered a probe?

“Critical players are being invited. The probe will be very comprehensive and heads will roll. Everyone, who played whatever role will be established”, another source explained.

The NMDPRA had alerted Nigerians over its discovery of petrol imported into the country that contained methanol above Nigeria’s specification.

The methanol-blended petrol, which is not made for Nigeria, made its way into the country.

The quantity was said to be within the range of 200 million litres.

The NNPC handles all the imports through its ‘Crude-for-fuel’ contracts, also known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP).

The agency conducted the business through a consortium of local and foreign oil firms.

Each consortium is said to have received about 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total of about 320,000bpd of Nigeria’s output.

The consortium, according to NNPC, includes MRS, Oando, EMADEB/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania and Duke Oil.

The NNPC, consequently, accused the four petroleum suppliers it engaged in the swap-crude-for-petrol of culpability.

Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, later promised that government would compensate those whose car engines were affected by the toxic fuel.

But the contractors denied responsibility.

Despite NNPC’s Efforts, Petrol Queues Persist in Abuja, Lagos

Meanwhile, many filling stations were still under lock and key in Abuja and Lagos yesterday while the few that were selling petrol had long queues, despite the desperate efforts by the NNPC Limited to bring the situation under control in the last one week.

Majority of the dispensing centres visited by THISDAY in the two major cities did not have the product while those that were selling, including the NNPC, had long queues of buyers lined up.

Recently, the national oil company had taken a multi-pronged approach to halt the pains encountered by Nigerians as a result of the nationwide fuel shortage.

Among other measures, the NNPC had announced that between last week and the end of February, it was expecting at least 2.3 billion litres of the product to berth in Nigeria.

Although in the last few days, there had been considerable movement of trucks within Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), many of the streets had remained clogged by traffic due to the prevailing condition.

In addition, the NNPC stated that in collaboration with other stakeholders, it was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians could buy the product round the clock in filling stations.

Besides, it announced that at the moment, the nation has over one billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe after successfully withdrawing the bad fuel that disrupted supply.

But THISDAY observed that many filling stations were still not selling the product yesterday, despite all the measures put in place by the sole supplier.

In both Lagos Island and the mainland, long queues of vehicles were seen at the few filling stations selling petrol.

It was also a brisk business for the ‘black market’ operators, who were selling one litre of the product for N300 – N500, depending on the location.

At Oando in Mabushi, near the Ministry of Works in Abuja, the gates were still locked while there was no petrol at Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar way, Zone 1, although cars were in the queues.

There were also no sales at the Enyo filling station, near GSM Village, and the Total Filling Station on Herbert Macaulay Street.

But at the NNPC mega station on Olusegun Obasanjo Way, sales were ongoing, but a long queue of almost one kilometre was observed.

However, unlike in the past two weeks when motorists blocked the road, some level of sanity has returned.

In the outskirts of Abuja, motorists and commuters were still largely stranded due to their inability to access petrol to get to their destinations.

Many commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the road in frustration.

At the Karshi, Orozo, Jikwoyi axis of the FCT, motorists spent hours in queues waiting to be served in the few filling stations that had the product to sell.

Long queues were also on both sides of the Karshi-Nyanya expressway, causing gridlock that stretched down the roads for kilometres.

"CBN Has Enough FX to Meet Market Demand, Report Reveals","* Says inflows from Eurobond, SDR will boost forex supply

Festus Akanbi

Amid a spate of measures being put in place by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce pressure on the nation’s foreign exchange market, analysts from Coudros Securities have expressed confidence in the capacity of the apex bank to meet the forex demand with inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).

In its Weekly economic and market update titled: ‘Overview of markets in the week ended 18 February 2022,’ the securities company also stressed the need to attract more foreign portfolio investments to sustain liquidity inflow to the economy.

The analysts argued that the current low level of crude oil production has weakened foreign reserves accretion, a development which they said necessitated the implementation of policies that would encourage the inflow of foreign portfolio investments.

According to the report, “the CBN has enough supply to support the FX market over the short term, given inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF’s SDR.

“However, foreign inflows are paramount for sustained FX liquidity over the medium term, in line with our expectation that accretion to the reserves will be weak given that crude oil production levels remain pretty low.”

The report called for additional measures to attract FPIs, insisting that: “Thus, FPIs which have historically supported supply levels in the IEW (53.8% of FX inflows to the IEW in 2019FY) will be needed to sustain FX liquidity levels. Hence, we think (1) further adjustments in the NGN/USD peg closer to its fair value and (2) flexibility in the exchange rate would significantly attract foreign inflows back to the market.”

As of last week, Nigeria’s foreign reserves was $40.7 billion almost at the $42 billion thresholds set by the apex bank for mid-2022.

Last year, Nigeria was able to raise $4 billion through Eurobonds, which financial analysts described as a reflection of investors’ confidence in the economy.

The Debt Management Office (DMO) had in a statement explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.

The Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years –,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum.

Also last year, the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved the allocation of $3.35 billion to Nigeria as part of a historic general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the International Multilateral Institution.

SDRs are international reserve assets created by the IMF and allocated to members to supplement existing official reserves. Holdings of SDRs by an IMF member are recorded as an asset, while the allocation of SDRs is recorded as the incurrence of liability of the member receiving them.

Earlier this year, the CBN announced a new scheme to improve dollar supply, known as Bankers’ Committee “RT200 FX Programme”, which stands for the “Race to $200 billion in FX Repatriation.”

According to the Governor of CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, “the RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us to attain our lofty yet attainable goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.”

"Unlawful dismissal: Navy yet to 'fully reinstate' Labinjo, wife -- despite supreme court verdict","Years after getting court judgments ordering their reinstatement into the naval service, Dada Labinjo and his wife, Sherifat Ibe-Lamberts (also known as Bola Labinjo), say the Nigerian Navy is yet to comply.

This is in spite of letters sent to the office of the vice-president and the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), seeking the intervention of the federal government.

HOW IT STARTED: IBE-LAMBERTS’ STORY

Advertisement

In 1997, Ibe-Lamberts, who was a lieutenant-commander in the navy at the time, appeared before a court martial on a five-count charge, including an allegation of unauthorised visit to a foreign mission.

On July 12, 1997, Sherifat was convicted and sentenced to two years of loss in seniority by the court martial. When the naval board ratified the conviction, the sanction was upgraded to compulsory retirement as contained in a letter dated February 2, 1998.

In the letter seen by TheCable, the naval board said her service was “no longer required,” adding that the retirement will take effect from January 21, 1998.

Advertisement

Dissatisfied with the conditions for retirement, Ibe-Lamberts filed a suit against the navy and the case went up to the appeal court. In December 2005, the appeal court ruled in her favour and set aside the ruling of the court martial.

Subsequently, the navy proceeded to the supreme court to request that the lower court’s judgment be set aside. In September 2007, the supreme court dismissed the navy’s appeal for lack of merit.

LABINJO’S EXPERIENCE

Advertisement

Labinjo, who was then a navy captain, was accused of offences ranging from disobedience of superior order to alleged involvement in oil bunkering.

In 2001, a court martial convicted Labinjo and sentenced him to six years imprisonment with a recommendation of dismissal. He subsequently approached the federal high court in Lagos to seek a dismissal of the ruling of the court martial on the basis that it was a breach of his fundamental human rights.

On May 3, 2004, the federal high court in Lagos declared the trial null and void for gross irregularities and breach of the fundamental human rights of the respondent. The court also ruled that Labinjo should be restored to his pre-trial position in the navy with payment of arrears of salaries and allowances.

However, the navy, through its counsel, filed a notice in the appeal court on May 31, 2004, and followed it up with an application filed on August 19, 2004.

In May 2008, the court dismissed the appeal filed by the navy for want of diligent prosecution, following the refusal of the navy to file “more legible copies” of the exhibits of the case presented to the lower court.

The navy, thereafter, approached the supreme court on the grounds that the appeal court was wrong to dismiss its suit without the opportunity to put forward its case, which the navy said violated its right to a fair hearing.

In June 2012, the supreme court ruled that the appeal was without merit and affirmed the decision of the lower court.

REINSTATED — BUT ‘WITHOUT PROMOTIONS AND ENTITLEMENTS’

After a series of letters written by the couple’s counsel to the ministry of justice, in 2015, Taiwo Abidogun, the solicitor-general at the time, wrote to the defence minister to ask for the navy to comply with the court rulings.

“This matter has a chequered history, having traversed the hierarchy of courts to the Supreme Court and back. In the circumstances, it is advised that it is in the best interest of the Nigerian Navy to comply with the judgment at the earliest possible time as it is worrisome for agencies of government to be seen in defiance of valid and subsisting court judgments,” the letter reads.

“However, in complying with this judgment, the Nigerian Navy may take steps to negotiate the amount to be paid to the claimant. This ministry volunteers its services to act as mediator to facilitate a negotiation between the parties.”

On April 11, 2017, the couple received letters notifying them of their reinstatement into the force.

Before his dismissal, Labinjo, who joined the navy in 1975, held the rank of captain, while Ibe-Lamberts joined the navy in 1984 and held the rank of lieutenant-commander at the time of her dismissal. The letters of reinstatement, however, did not state anything on benefits or promotions.

Again, the couple wrote to the naval authorities requesting that all previous promotions and entitlements be effected in line with the time that had passed. In 2018, the navy, in its response to the letters on payments of corresponding benefits, insisted that the court “only ordered the reinstatement of the senior officers to the Nigerian Navy and nothing more”.

DETENTION AMID LEGAL DISPUTE

While the couple awaited the navy’s position on full reinstatement, on September 13, 2018, Labinjo was arrested and detained in an underground cell. The next day, his wife was arrested. They were accused of conspiracy and unlawful dealing in petroleum products.

The couple spent months in detention amid calls for their release, including interventions by Femi Falana, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), as well as a court order directing that they be freed.

Eventually, Ibe-Lamberts was released in August 2019, while Labinjo was released on December 3, 2019. They were then handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for prosecution over alleged offences bordering on oil bunkering. The next court appearance on the EFCC case is scheduled for March 2022.

APPEAL TO AGF, OSINBAJO

While the couple awaits the navy on full reinstatement, several letters have been written to the office of the AGF and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, seeking their intervention on the matter.

In July 2021, the couple, through their counsel, wrote yet another letter to the AGF.

“The implication of the judgments in respect of the 2 officers is that the courts have granted accrued promotions to the officers as follows: ‘Capt DO Labinjo: Commodore with effect from July 2003; Rear Admiral with effect from July 2006; Vice Admiral with effect from March 2011; Admiral with effect from April 2013; and Lieutenant Commander SA Ibe-Lamberts: Commander with effect from 27 August, 1998; Captain with effect from 27 August, 2004; Commodore with effect from 27 August, 2009; Rear Admiral with effect from 27 August. 2013,” the letter to Malami reads.

“It is on this note, sir, that we humbly request the honourable minister and attorney-general of the federation to use his esteemed office to cause the Nigerian Navy to restore our clients to where they ought to be, by granting their accrued promotions to rear admiral and admiral, respectively, and immediate retirement from the service of the Nigerian Navy thereafter and the payment of all their accrued emoluments, entitlements, gratuity and pensions respectively.”

In October 2021, the AGF forwarded the petition to the navy, asking for comments to enable him to take an “informed decision” on the matter.

“I am directed to forward the above mentioned petition dated 12th July, 2021 with reference No: MLC/NN/07-21/01 addressed to the honourable attorney general of the federation and minister of justice by Marina Law Chambers on behalf of the client. A copy is herewith attached for ease of reference,” the AGF’s letter to the navy reads.

“I am further directed to request for your comments to enable the honourable attorney general of the federation take an informed decision on the matter.”

‘WE WANT FULL REINSTATEMENT’

Speaking with TheCable on behalf of the couple, Labinjo said after full reinstatement and receiving payment for all previous entitlements, they will willingly resign from service, since they have exceeded the required years of service.

“We are asking for three things. One, they (referring to navy) should re-employ us in line with the court order. The meaning of reinstatement is to re-employ the person,” he said.

“Two, restore the person. If you reinstate somebody and you did not restore, you haven’t done anything. Would you have done justice? To restore us, they need to get us all the promotions accrued to us during the litigation period.

“That same day, accept our resignation from the navy. My 35 years’ service in the navy should have ended in 2010, while that of my wife is 2019. All our mates have retired.

“None of us is technically employable in the navy but they should do documentation, re-employ us, at the same time, accept our resignation and pay us all our previous entitlements and emoluments accrued during the litigation period.”

NAVY YET TO RESPOND

When TheCable reached out to Suleman Dahun, navy spokesperson, he asked that a letter be sent to the navy seeking an explanation on the Labinjo and Ibe-Lamberts case.

The letter was sent via the email address provided by the navy spokesperson but no response had been received at the time of this report.","Years after getting court judgments ordering their reinstatement into the naval service, Dada Labinjo and his wife, Sherifat Ibe-Lamberts (also known as Bola Labinjo), say the Nigerian Navy is yet to comply.

"Oyo Monarch, Alaafin, May Broker Peace Between Tinubu, Aregbesola","The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi, is expected to wade into the face-off between the national leader and presidential hopeful of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his estranged godson and Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.

A source told journalists in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, that the rift between the duo had created a political tension in the South-West, hence the planned intervention of the foremost Oyo monarch.

Tinubu was scheduled to pay a visit to the palace of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi this Sunday, as part of the continuation of his engagement with traditional rulers across the country’s six geo-political zones in respect of his 2023 presidential ambition.

LEADERSHIP, however, gathered that Tinubu’s planned visit to the Alaafin is not connected to the feud between him and Aregbesola even though the traditional ruler will be willing to broker peace between the duo at the appropriate time.

In an exclusive chat with LEADERSHIP, a member of the House of Representatives and a son of Alaafin, Prince Akeem Adeyemi, said Tinubu’s visit to the Oyo Palace has nothing to do with any peace meeting.

“Asiwaju is coming today to visit Alaafin as part of his consultations with monarchs, it has nothing to do with any rift settlement and the Alaafin did not summon anybody to the palace for any peace meeting.

“However, if the need be, the Alaafin will wade into the rift in the interest of peace and development of Yoruba land. But that is not for today (Sunday), it’s a matter for another day,” Prince Adeyemi said.

It would be recalled that Aregbesola’s anointed aspirant, Moshood Adeoti lost to the incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola in the Saturday’s APC primary election.

"Niger Delta: Stakeholders Task State Govts, Others On Capacity-building","As part of conscious efforts to change the negative narrative about Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta, young professionals have tasked governors of the region to invest more in human capacity development and create purposeful opportunities for young people, especially entrepreneurs and start-ups, to thrive.

The position was canvassed by stakeholders, who gathered at the 2nd Niger Delta MSME Summit held on Saturday, February 19, in Asaba, Delta State, with the theme: ‘Stimulating MSMEs Growth Towards Post Covid-19 Recovery’.

ADVERTISEMENT

They advocated that governments of the Niger State States must move away from the political tradition of just signing and awarding contracts, to strategic empowerment and support for innovative creative minds in the region.

The event jointly organised by the Niger Delta Young Professionals (NDYP) and the Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), was sequel to the pioneer edition held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital in February, 2021.

ADVERTISEMENT

Delivering his opening remarks at the event, the chairman of the NYPF and convener of the summit, Mr Moses Siloko Siasia, explained that the event was aimed at creating a platform for young business owners to interface with agencies of government and stakeholders on how best to access information, credit, support facilities, as well as build strategic relationships and networks.

The summit according to him, will also go a long way in changing the wrong perceptions of militancy and other forms of youth restiveness that many associate the region’s youthful population with.

“Today, if you go to Google and search for Niger Delta youths, what you will see are youths with guns inside speed boat and all those bad stuffs. We must change that, we must change that negative narrative, this is not the narrative of the Niger Delta people, our leaders must help us to change that narrative because the time for politics is over in today’s world.

“We are in the 4th industrial revolution where people are using digital intelligence and technology to change the worlds economies. We must conform to modern reality and that is why we are doing this MSME Summit to help our young people, so that they can build the capacity to create sustainable livelihood for themselves, their family and the society,” he said.

Siasia further called on successful businessmen from the region the CEO of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu; group managing director of Access Bank, Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe; chairman of Zenith Bank, Jim Ovia; founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, Atedo Peterside, CON, and many others, to deliberately leave footprints from their region, stressing that charity begins at home.

Lending his voice to Siasia’s call, CEO of BlueCamel Energy Limited, Mr Suleiman Yusuf, lamented that successful people were not enjoying the full proceeds of their wealth, owing to youth restiveness and numerous forms of insecurity arising from the absence of platforms to productively engage them.

“Success has found its way to the long list of problems we have in Nigeria because successful people in private industry or government cannot freely enjoy their wealth. They live in highly fortified houses, travel in armoured vehicles and cannot move around without armed personnel.

“This problem exists because there are no jobs and support mechanisms to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship among youths. Unless jobs and created and young people are engaged, there will be no peace in the Nger Delta and other regions. Government and well to do individuals must begin to allocate resources towards human capacity development, especially for young people who are leaders of tomorrow,” he submitted.

On his part, the executive secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote, represented by the Board’s General Manager, Capacity Development, Dr. Ama Ikuru, acknowledged that Nigeria ranks poorly in terms of human capacity development index.

According to him: “The discussions we are having at this Summit can change the narrative. We want to see the emergence of young entrepreneurs and support them to succeed. We want to put tools in their toolboxes to ensure the security and economic prosperity of our nation.”

While noting that the NCDMB has interventions in place to help promote entrepreneurship such as the $350m Nigerian Content Intervention Fund to help businesses in the oil and gas industry access finance, Wabote added that the Board will continue to associate and support anything that is in the best interest of the good people of Nigeria, especially its vibrant youth population.

Saturday’s event saw the convergence of over 1,000 participants from the nine Niger Delta States, who gathered to build on the success of the innaugural summit held last year, where over 300 Niger Deltans benefited from the NIRSAL intervention loans for small business owners in the area of agriculture.

In his closing remarks, Siasia appreciated the stakeholders that supported the summit, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), led by its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who is from Delta State; CEO, Heritage Bank Plc, Dr Ifie Sekibo; NCDMB boss, Engr Simbi Wabote, and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) led by Mr Effiong Akwa.

High point of the event was the sharing of heart-touching testimonies by some successful business owners in the Niger Delta.

They appreciated stakeholders for the platform, stressing that they have grown successful businesses with youths under their employment, whereby creating jobs.

It is noteworthy that the 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit is the 48th event to be organised by the NYPF.

The NYPF has in the space of a few years, held value-adding events in Nigeria and abroad. In one of its strategic events held at New York in 2016, the then United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, sent a special goodwill message to the NYPF, acknowledging its drive for human capacity development.

Aliyu stressed that in the course of monitoring the voting process it was observed that it was slow at several polling units owing to malfunctioning or faulty BVAS machines.

FBI Vs Hushpuppi: FG Told To Extradite Abba Kyari To US After NDLEA Arrest,"FBI Vs Hushpuppi: FG Told To Extradite Abba Kyari To US After NDLEA Arrest

Ohanaeze Ndigbo has requested the Federal Government of Nigeria to enable DCP Abba Kyari, the suspended head of the IRT, to be extradited to the United States to face the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) claims in the hushpuppi affair.

Ramon Abbas, a.k.a. Hushpuppi, is being investigated by the FBI on allegations of Business Email Compromise (BEC) and money laundering.

The FBI requested that Nigeria send up Kyari in August 2021.

The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arrested Kyari and others on Monday for alleged ties to an international narcotics syndicate.

The Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the policemen charged with links to an international narcotics syndicate on Thursday.

“DCP Abba Kyari, who was under suspension previous to this allegation, shall stay on suspension,” the PSC wrote.

The statements Kyari made to undercover officers probing the cocaine seizure were previously published by the anti-narcotics agency.

Ohanaeze, in a statement given to DAILY POST on Sunday by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, reacted to the situation by advising the FG not to allow Kyari to remain in Nigeria following his recent arrest by the NDLEA.

The statement read, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has warned that the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari should never be allowed to remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by NDLEA, with overwhelming evidence of complicity in drugs-related cases.

“Rather than keeping him here in Nigeria, he should be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from FBI over the hushpuppi scandal and criminal activities.

“DCP Abba Kyari should be allowed to face his crimes in the United States. This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.

“The activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.

“The overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect’s belongings and cash is second to none; that’s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.”

“There is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari. Nemesis is hunting Kyari. Nigerians want a thorough investigation of the alleged criminal indictment of Abba Kyari and subsequent extradition to the United States.”","FBI Vs Hushpuppi: FG Told To Extradite Abba Kyari To US After NDLEA ArrestOhanaeze Ndigbo has requested the Federal Government of Nigeria to enable DCP Abba Kyari, the suspended head of the IRT, to be extradited to the United States to face the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) claims in the hushpuppi affair.

JUST IN: Aregbesola Laments As Oyetola Wins Osun APC Guber Ticket,"JUST IN: Aregbesola Laments As Oyetola Wins Osun APC Guber Ticket

Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola has been proclaimed the winner of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary poll.

The election is billed to hold on July 16.

The governor, who is seeking a second term in office, defeated Moshood Adeoti and Yusuf Lasun to win the governorship primary on Saturday.

The results were announced around 3am on Sunday by AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, Kwara state governor and chairman of the Osun APC primary election committee.

“I hereby certified that Gboyega Oyetola, having secured the number of highest votes cast at the primary election and having secured all guidelines contained, is hereby declared winner,” he said.

Oyetola was adjudged to have polled 222,169 votes while his closest challenger, Moshood Adeoti, secured 12,921 votes and Yusuf Lasun had just 460.

According to the primary election committee, the total number of accredited voters stood at 247,207 while 235,550 votes were cast.

The primary election was marred by allegations of widespread irregularities while several party members also claimed that their names were expunged from the voters’ register.

Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, had described the exercise as a “sham of an election”.

The minister had asked his supporters not to take laws into their hands, saying his camp will “explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice”.

The APC in Osun has two factions: one is loyal to Aregbesola while the other pledges allegiance to Oyetola, the incumbent governor of the state.

The build-up to Saturday’s primary highlighted a division within the ruling party in the state following a disagreement between incumbent Governor Oyetola and his predecessor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola.

This prompted the former governor to seek to unseat Oyetola whom he supported to succeed him in September 2018. Aregbesola, who serves as the Minister of Interior in President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet, has now declared his support for Adeoti, as his anointed candidate for the forthcoming election.

The primary also came with drama and controversy as the members of the camps of the minister and governor traded blames and accusations, including accusing each side of instigating violence. Both sides denied doing anything to disturb the peace or to illegally influence the outcome of the poll.

Notwithstanding the disagreement, the minister asked members of the party in the state loyal to him to conduct themselves in a peaceful matter throughout the exercise.

While the primary was in progress, the faction of the APC loyal to the minister condemned it.

In a statement by its spokesman, Abiodun Agboola, the faction alleged widespread irregularities in the exercise conducted by the Osun APC Primary Election Committee led by Governor Abdulrasaq of Kwara State.

“The Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee should know that the primary lacks credibility and fairness,” it said.

“It is necessary and important to inform the general public and Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee of the ongoing irregularities in the conduct of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun.

“We strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there are no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.”

Governor Oyetola, on his part commended the process, and described as free and fair after voting.","﻿Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has won the governorship primary of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state.

Judiciary Open To Initiatives For Capacity Building For Judicial Officers – CJN,"The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon. Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, has said the Judiciary is open to initiatives aimed at improving and strengthening the capacity of judicial officers in the handling of cases on emerging crime trends in the country.

The CJN made the request at the weekend while playing host to a visiting delegation of US officials led by the Ambassador to Nigeria, Ms. Mary Beth Leonard.

Some of those emerging crimes, the CJN said include cybercrime, cross-jurisdictional infringement of Intellectual property rights, and cases related to cybersecurity and espionage.

The CJN added that judges in the country require training on block technology and online dispute resolution as it affects e-commerce which is becoming a challenge due to inadequate awareness of technology and technical abilities and capacity.

He requested for workshops that would border on Copyright Law in the new digital environment for judicial officers and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards relating to intellectual property disputes.

‘’Capacity building for our judicial officers is our priority, while the development of the capacity of our Research Assistants and other staff of the National Judicial Institute, who are fully involved in these training programmes, is also very important.

‘’Your Excellency, without taking the cat out of your bag, I want to assure you that our doors are always wide open to welcome proposals that will be beneficial to the development of the Rule of Law and the overall growth of the Judiciary of this country.

“The National Judicial Institute will never relent in its efforts to serve as the principal focal point of judicial activities on issues relating to the promotion of efficiency, uniformity and improvement in the quality of judicial services in our courts’’, the CJN stated.

The U.S. Ambassador said, “this courtesy call is an opportunity to encourage the Nigerian Judiciary to continue collaborating with the United States Mission, including in raising the profile of intellectual property (IP) protection which is essential for Nigeria’s development and international partnerships’’.

She said the US is looking to increase its capacity-building engagement on cybersecurity issues, adding that her country is interested in continued collaboration with the Judiciary and courts through its International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office (INL) and Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT).

Ms. Leonard hinted that the U.S. was exploring how best to support Nigeria’s judicial processes during the 2023 elections.

The justices of the Supreme Court, who accompanied the CJN to receive the U.S. delegation are Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, Inyang John Okoro, Amina Adamu Augie, Ejembi Eko, Uwani Musa Abba-Aji, M.L.Garba, Helen Ogunwumiju, Abdu Aboki, Adamu Jauro and Emmanuel A. Agim.

Putin Oversees Nuclear Drills as US Insists Russia Plans to Invade Ukraine,"Russia’s strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Washington accused Russian troops massed near Ukraine’s border of advancing and being “poised to strike”.

With Western fears of war rising, the White House said U.S President Joe Biden’s national security team told him they still believed Russia could launch an attack in Ukraine “at any time” and he planned to convene his top advisers on Sunday to discuss the crisis.

Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations said they had seen no evidence Russia is reducing its military activity in the area and remained “gravely concerned” about the situation.

After Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over new shelling near the border, France and Germany urged all or some of their citizens in Ukraine to leave. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to “uncoil and move closer” to the border.

“We hope he (Putin) steps back from the brink of conflict,” Austin told a news conference in Lithuania, saying an invasion of Ukraine was not inevitable.

Russia ordered the military build-up while demanding NATO prevent Ukraine from ever joining the alliance but says Western warnings that it is planning to invade Ukraine are hysterical and dangerous. Moscow says it is pulling back, but Washington and allies say the build-up is mounting.

Washington and NATO say Moscow’s main demands are non-starters, but in Ukraine fears are growing over Putin’s plans.

Venting his frustration at a security conference in Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the global security architecture was “almost broken”. He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Turkey to meet to draw up new security guarantees for his country.

“The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work,” Zelenskiy said. “They do not keep up with new threats … This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine.”

World Bank President David Malpass told Zelenskiy on Saturday the bank was readying funding to Ukraine of up to $350 million.

The Kremlin said Russia successfully test-launched hypersonic and cruise missiles at sea during the nuclear forces drills. Putin observed the exercises on screens with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko from a “situation centre”.

In his most pointed prediction so far, Biden said on Friday he was convinced that Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine in the coming days, and Austin said on Saturday the nuclear forces exercises were stoking concerns around the world.

“President Biden continues to monitor the evolving situation in Ukraine, and is being updated regularly about events on the ground by his national security team,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. “They reaffirmed that Russia could launch an attack against Ukraine at any time.”

G7 foreign ministers called on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy. “As a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine’s borders. We have seen no evidence of this reduction,” they said in a statement.

Zelenskiy said he had an “urgent” phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed possible ways of immediate de-escalation and political-diplomatic settlement. Macron is due to speak with Putin on Sunday.

The nuclear drills follow manoeuvres by Russia’s armed forces in the past four months that have included a build-up of troops — estimated by the West to number 150,000 or more — to the north, east and south of Ukraine.

New helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and support equipment have been moved to sites in Russia near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies, which tracks developments with satellite imagery.

Moscow-based analysts said Saturday’s exercises were aimed at sending a message to take Russia’s demands seriously.

“Ignoring Russia’s legitimate rights in this area adversely affects the stability not only on the European continent, but also in the world,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by his ministry as telling his French counterpart by phone.

A NATO official said the alliance relocated staff from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv and to Brussels for safety reasons. The United States and other countries have moved diplomats to Lviv.

SHELLING ALLEGATIONS

Russian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east.

Separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have declared a full military mobilisation after ordering women and children to evacuate to Russia, citing the threat of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces, which Kyiv denied.

Kyiv and Western leaders say the mobilisation, evacuation and increased shelling are part of a Russian plan to create a pretext for an invasion.

Russia’s FSB security service said two shells landed on Russian territory near the border, Russia’s Tass news agency reported.

Ukraine’s military accused Russia of faking pictures of shells to make out they were Ukrainian, and said mercenaries had arrived in separatist-held eastern Ukraine to stage provocations in collaboration with Russian special forces.

Ukraine’s foreign minister demanded an independent international investigation of the alleged incidents and the military said two soldiers had been killed in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine.

The two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said. And almost 2,000 ceasefire violations were registered in the area by OSCE monitors on Saturday, a diplomatic source told Reuters. read more

Multiple explosions were heard overnight into Sunday in the centre of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, a Reuters reporter said. The blasts’ origin was not clear. There was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or Kyiv.

“It’s really scary. I’ve taken everything I could carry,” said Tatyana, 30, who was boarding a bus with her 4-year-old daughter.

Russian news agencies said 10,000 evacuees had arrived in Russia. Separatist leaders say they aim to evacuate 700,000 people.","U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to “uncoil and move closer” to the border.

"Russia Planning Biggest War in Europe Since 1945, UK PM Johnson Says","Evidence suggests Russia is planning “the biggest war in Europe since 1945”, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

He told the BBC’s Sophie Raworth in an interview: “All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun.”

Intelligence suggests Russia intends to launch an invasion that will encircle Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Mr Johnson said.

“People need to understand the sheer cost in human life that could entail,” he said

The prime minister was speaking from Munich, where world leaders are meeting for an annual security conference.

The latest estimates by the US government suggests that between 169,000 and 190,000 Russian troops are now stationed along Ukraine’s border, both in Russia and neighbouring Belarus – but this figure also includes rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Mr Johnson also indicated that the UK would bring in even more far-reaching sanctions against Russia than have been suggested before.

He said the UK and the US would stop Russian companies “trading in pounds and dollars” – a move that he said would “hit very very hard” with its impact.

Previous sanctions suggested by ministers include broadening the range of Russian people and businesses the UK could target.

Western officials have warned in recent weeks that Russia could be preparing to invade at any time, but Russia has denied the claims, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region.Asked whether a Russian invasion is still thought to be imminent, Mr Johnson said: “I’m afraid that that is what the evidence points to, there’s no burnishing it.”The fact is that all the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun.”The prime minister said US President Joe Biden had told Western leaders intelligence suggested Russian forces were not just planning on entering Ukraine from the east, via Donbas, but down from Belarus and the area surrounding Kyiv.”I’m afraid to say that the plan we are seeing is for something that could be really the biggest war in Europe since 1945 just in terms of sheer scale,” the prime minister said.People needed to not only consider the potential loss of life of Ukrainians, but also of “young Russians”, he added.Mr Johnson was speaking after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and telling world leaders in a speech that any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would “echo around the world”.","Evidence suggests Russia is planning “the biggest war in Europe since 1945”, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy Calls on Putin to Meet as Tensions Soar,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, facing a sharp spike in violence in and around territory held by Russia-backed rebels and increasingly dire warnings that Russia plans to invade, on Saturday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him and seek resolution to the crisis.

“I don’t know what the president of the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting,” Zelenskyy said at the Munich Security Conference, where he also met with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. Zelenskyy said Russia could pick the location for the talks.

“Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

There was no immediate response from the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy spoke hours after separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine ordered a full military mobilization on Saturday while Western leaders made increasingly dire warnings that a Russian invasion of its neighbor appeared imminent.

In new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa canceled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion.NATO’s liaison office in Kyiv said it was relocating staff to Brussels and to the western Ukraine city of Lviv. Meanwhile, top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the nearly eight-year separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

The officials fled to a bomb shelter before hustling from the area, according to an Associated Press journalist who was on the tour.Violence in eastern Ukraine has spiked in recent days as Ukraine and the two regions held by the rebels each accused the other of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed that claim as “a fake statement.”Sporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed rebels, but the recent shelling and bombing spike could set off a full-scale war.The United States and many European countries have alleged for months that Russia, which has moved about 150,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, is trying to create pretexts to invade.“They are uncoiling and are now poised to strike,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday during a visit to Lithuania.Harris opened her meeting with Zelenskyy by saying the world was at “a decisive moment in history.”Earlier Saturday, Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, cited an “immediate threat of aggression” from Ukrainian forces in his announcement. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force.“I appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,” Pushilin said. ”Together we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need.”A similar statement followed from his counterpart in the Luhansk region. On Friday, the rebels began evacuating civilians to Russia with an announcement that appeared to be part of their and Moscow’s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the evacuation orders could be a tactic to provide the spark for a broader attack.“To say it very clearly, Ukraine did not give any grounds for the evacuation that was ordered yesterday,” she said. “Those are the facts on the ground. We must not allow supposed reasons for war to be constructed out of hot air.”U.S. President Joe Biden said late Friday that based on the latest American intelligence, he was now “convinced” that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital.“As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.”Biden was briefed on Harris’ meetings in Munich and has been getting regular updates on the Ukraine situation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Saturday. Biden will discuss Ukraine during a meeting with his National Security Council on Sunday, she said.Meanwhile, Russia conducted massive nuclear drills on Saturday. The Kremlin said Putin, who pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats, was watching the drills together with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko from the situation room.Notably, the planned exercise involves the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014. .Underscoring the West’s concerns of an imminent invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border.The shift has been underway for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.Lines of communication between Moscow and the West remain open: the American and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron scheduled a phone call with Putin on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. Violations of a 2015 ceasefire agreement, including shelling and shooting along the line of contact, have been common.A car bomb exploded in the center of the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk on Friday. Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. No injuries were reported in the incidents.Ukraine’s military said two of its soldiers died in firing from the rebel side on Saturday.By Saturday morning, the separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas, said that thousands of residents of the rebel-controlled areas had been evacuated to Russia.Russia has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action.Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk rebel government, alleged in a video statement that Ukraine was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, the AP confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s effort to come up with an invasion pretext could include staged, prerecorded videos.Authorities in Russia’s Rostov region, which borders eastern Ukraine, declared a state of emergency because of the influx of evacuees. Media reports on Saturday described chaos at some of the camps assigned to accommodate the people from eastern Ukraine. The reports said there were long lines of buses and hundreds of people waiting in the cold for hours on end to be housed without access to food or bathroom facilities.Putin ordered the Russian government to offer 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, an amount equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in eastern Ukraine.___","Zelenskyy said Russia could pick the location for the talks.

"FG Willing to Partner Investors on Power Supply, Says Minister","The Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, has disclosed that the federal government was willing to partner investors in the power sector to improve electricity supply in the country

This came as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET), Mr. Nnaemeka Ewelukwa, said the government was putting reforms in place to ensure stable power supply in the country.

Aliyu, in a statement signed by the Information Officer in the Press and Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of Power, Mr. Mathew Osumanyi Dan’asabe, made this known while receiving the Ambassador of Turkey to Nigeria, Mr. Hidayet Bayratar, in company of two other delegates in his office in Abuja.

He said President Muhammadu Buhari’s desire towards the power sector was to ensure that the electricity supply industry is owned by both government and the private sectors.

According to him, Nigeria and Turkey’s relationship is a long-standing one which culminated in the signing of an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Turkey and Nigeria in October 2021 for mutual benefits.

Aliyu told the ambassador that various interventions were being put into the power sector of the country.

He described the distribution aspect of the power sector in the country as an area worth investing.

The minister urged Turkey and the rest of the world to partner Nigeria and share experience in the fields of energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

In his response, the ambassador said their visit was a follow-up to the MoU signed in 2021.

In related development, the Managing Director of NBET, Ewelukwa, has said that the federal government is putting reforms in place to ensure stable power supply in the country.

Ewelukwa made this known at a capacity-building workshop for members of the Power Correspondents Association of Nigeria (PCAN) and Civil Society Organisations in Lagos.

The workshop, with the theme: ‘Building knowledge and Plugging Skills Gap in Power Sector Reporting’, indicates a worrisome mismatch that government wants to plug.

He said the critical reforms that the government has embarked upon are designed to sustain the financial status of the market, ensure technical capacity to remove the deficit in supply to meet the demand of the country.”

According to him, the federal government has begun the implementation of the transmission expansion plan which works in sync with the government/Siemens Presidential Power Initiative – with phase one – (7,000mw), phase two – (11,000mw) and phase three (25,000mw) supply.

Ewelukwa said “this government is keen to implement these reforms. To be honest with you, we are having sleepless nights to achieve these.”

He said that government plans to keep expanding generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the country’s demand.

According to him, the distribution companies are also improving their performances and facilities to ensure improved power supply.

Explaining NBET’s function in the Transition Electricity Based Market, he said the design is to temporary bridge in the electricity market.

He said NBET has a long-term role to drive market competition by ensuring that it is moved from a government-centered market to a private-sector driven electricity market.

“We are enthusiastically looking at the point when we will actually start the innovation process of handing over the Power Purchase Agreements we signed to distribution licencees and eligible customers as the case may be,” he said.

James Sowole in Abeokuta","He said President Muhammadu Buhari’s desire towards the power sector was to ensure that the electricity supply industry is owned by both government and the private sectors.

"Makinde receives last batch of 3,300 participants in agribusiness project from Nasarawa",".

By Adeola Badru

Governor ‘Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Sunday, received batch eleven of the total three thousand three hundred participants of the state’s Youth Entrepreneurship Agribusiness Programme (YEAP), who just arrived in Ibadan from Nasarawa State after their training in agribusiness.

The youths numbering about three hundred who could not hide their joy and excitement sang and danced while recounting their experiences during the agribusiness training programme at Nasarawa State.

According to the Executive Adviser on Agribusiness Matters to Governor Makinde, Dr Debo Akande, represented by Mr. Olufemi Ilori, the Director of YEAP and Technical Service, Oyo State Agribusiness Development Agency, OYSADA, the training was part of the state government’s commitment towards preparing the youths ahead of the agricultural revolution in the state in term of acquisition of necessary skills to key into the government’s agricultural agenda.

The agribusiness training for youths in the state state which started on August 8, 202, has seen no fewer than three thousand three hundred youths drawn from across the 33 local government areas of the state including non indigenes residents in the state.

Dr Akande commended the governor for his unwavering commitment and support for the success of the training programme, saying that the next phase is to engage the 33 local government executive chairmen to provide land for the graduands to start deploying the acquired knowledge.

He also said state government has made provisions for financial support for the YEAP graduands which will be rolled out in batches to enable effective monitoring and guidance.

He said: “The journey to Nasarawa state started on 8th of August last year and has ended today. It was not an easy journey. We thank God that we never recorded any form of casualty from start ofbthe program till the end because Governor Makinde provided everything needed for the success we have recorded.”

“This is the eleventh batch of three hundred youths per batch making it three thousand three hundred persons. One hundred per local government because we have 33 local governments in Oyo State.”

“The significance of this training is the empowerment so that the youths can be able to take up the challenges of Agribusiness. After production what next? The value chain and what they have learned in Nasarawa as they have been well equipped for the work ahead.”

“The state government under the leadership of Governor Seyi Makinde has directed the various local governments to provide land for these youths which is one of the basic things they need.”

“The financial aspect has been guaranteed by the state government so that as the last batch arrived today the next step is do them to be set up.” Akande said.

He assured that the state government will commence implementation of the next phase as soon as possible, saying that all participants have been captured through biometric means.

Akande added that the farmlands which will be provided for agribusiness purpose will be given to the youths grouped into clusters for effective monitoring on their developmental process.

Some of the YEAP beneficiaries who spoke with journalists expressed their satisfaction towards the way and manner their welfare were being taken care of throughout the training programme, noting that the training was all agribusiness inclusive.

One of the beneficiaries, Adeyinka Okanlawon from Saki West Local Government Area of Oke-Ogun zone, expressed his appreciation to Makinde for the privilege to participate in what he described as very laudable and expository programme, saying that the training has exposed him to various opportunities in agribusiness.

Another beneficiary, Olajire Aduragbemi Kehinde from Ido Local Government Area of Ibadan, said she learnt many things she never knew from the training saying: “I really learnt alot from the training programme from the greenhouses to agrophonix the six ways of cultivating cassava without weeding as well as how to add value to farm produce keying into the agribusiness value chain.”

Niyi Oluwabunmi Esther from Ogbomoso North Local Government Area said going to Nasarawa has changed her perception about many things including keying into the agribusiness value chain to earn a decent living and being financially independent.

Excited Kolade Kehinde from Oyo East Local Government said: “actually we spent two weeks but that two weeks felt like years because when you go to certain places to learn and you return home having achieved your target then you’re ready to go.”

Another beneficiary, Oribamise Temitope, said she is ready to go into fish farming, describing Makinde as amiable and quintessential leader.

She commended the governor for initiating the programme for the youths saying, Makinde has thought the youths how to fish from the river.

“Kudos to you sir for working assiduously to turn things around for the best for us in Oyo State. We youths are solidly behind you and can assure you that your second term is certain because we will ensure you lead us to our desired end by continuing as our governor till 2027.”

Speaking on behalf of non indegenes who also be befitted from the training programme, the youths leader of Igala community in Oyo State, Ayatu Unubi Paul, said he is ready to go fully into maize farming, saying his choice was based on the high demand for the farm produce for consumption and also for further agro-feeds processing for fish production.","By Adeola BadruGovernor ‘Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Sunday, received batch eleven of the total three thousand three hundred participants of the state’s Youth Entrepreneurship Agribusiness Programme (YEAP), who just arrived in Ibadan from Nasarawa State after their training in agribusiness.

"Enugu shuts markets, offices as council poll holds Wednesday","Enugu State Government said yesterday that Wednesday will be a work-free day, as the local government election holds across the state.

It said markets, parks and offices would be closed, while movement of people and vehicles would be restricted from 8am to 4pm, except those on essential duties.

A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information, Steve Oruruo, said: “The Enugu State Government (ENSG) wishes to notify the public that local government election will hold on Wednesday across the state.

“Consequently, the government has declared a statewide work free day from 8am to 4pm to allow the people exercise their constitutional suffrage.

“During this period, markets and offices shall be closed and movement of persons and vehicles restricted, except for those on essential duties.

“Residents legally qualified to vote are therefore encouraged to go to the polls and cast their ballots.

“The government, in its unflinching commitment to safeguarding and strengthening our democracy, has made arrangements to guarantee a hitch-free process.”

However, the main opposition party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has promised to void the election through the courts if the Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) conducts the exercise without listing its candidates in the ballot.

The party, which had raised the alarm over alleged exclusion of its candidates from participating in the election, alleged that it had been stopped from participating because the list of its candidates were not published by the electoral body.

It accused ENSIEC of a plot to disenfranchise the party faithful by refusing to publish a list of 260 councillorship and 17 chairmanship candidates it forwarded to the electoral body in December 2021.

Addressing the disenfranchised candidates and other party faithful at the state secretariat, Enugu, at the weekend, the state Chairman of APC, Ugochukwu Agballah, said the party would void the election should the electoral body exclude it from participating in the exercise.

He said the legal team of the party, led by a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), had filed a suit at the state High Court to void the election for unlawful exclusion, which he noted was a breach of the Constitution and the Electoral Act.

He accused the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government of colluding with unscrupulous elements in the APC to manipulate ENSIEC to frustrate APC from participating in the poll.

Agballah, who received his certificate of returns from the APC national leadership on February 14, claimed that his emergence as the chairman caused fears within the ranks of the state government and the ruling party

He said: “Excluding APC is the greatest mistake by ENSIEC. The electoral body disenfranchised our candidates. We held our primaries to elect our chairmanship and councillorship candidates on December 18 and 19, 2021. We submitted the list to ENSIEC, which it accepted. But ENSIEC decided to publish a list submitted by Ben Nwoye, a former suspended caretaker chairman of APC. ENSIEC knows Nwoye is no longer the chairman. We had written letters to ENSIEC with an avalanche of evidence to show that I’m the duly elected chairman of the APC at our October 16, 2021 state congress.”

CP orders personnel deployment

Enugu State Police Commissioner Mr. Lawal Abubakar has ordered the deployment of personnel and policing resources to ensure a secure and peaceful conduct of local government election.

He gave the directive in a statement yesterday in Enugu by spokesman Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Daniel Ndukwe.

The commissioner said the command was also committed to collaborating with other security agencies, local security outfits and stakeholders to provide security during the period of the elections and beyond.

He enjoined residents to remain vigilant, law-abiding and comply with the movement restriction order.

“They should report acts of electoral malpractice, violence and criminality to the nearest police station or by calling the command’s emergency hotlines on: 08032003702, 08075390883 or 08086671202; or by sending e-mails to:[email protected],” he said.","Enugu State Government said yesterday that Wednesday will be a work-free day, as the local government election holds across the state.

Governors meet Monday over new APC convention date,"By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintinsin, Abuja

Parley to set agenda for tomorrow’s talks with Buhari

Congresses to hold in zones

With the caretaker committee foot-dragging on plans for the party’s convention slated for Saturday, All Progressives Congress (APC) governors will meet today on the fate of the exercise.

The caretaker committee has not taken the needed steps to make the convention possible aside from notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

“No other steps necessary to show preparation for the convention has been taken by the caretaker committee, hence, the necessity for today’s meeting by the governors,” a source close to the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), said at the weekend.

- Advertisement -

It was learnt that today’s meeting will prepare grounds for tomorrow’s meeting of the governors and members of the Mai Mala-Buni led Caretaker Committee with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.

The meeting was shifted last week to enable the President to travel to Belgium for the European Union-Africa Union (EU-AU) Summit in Brussels.

The President returned on Saturday.

A source said the caretaker committee is planning to ask for a long shift of the convention, but some governors are believed to be angry about this.

They are said to be interested in a two-week shift from February 26 to March 12.

Part of the argument for the shift of date being proposed by the caretaker committee, it was learnt, is the need to hold the zonal congresses to elect the zonal vice chairmen before the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC).

Another argument is that the February 26 date coincides with by-elections in eight APC states.

The Saturday date is shaky because the caretaker committee has failed to unveil pre-convention activities, including zoning, sale of nomination forms, the inauguration of sub-committees and submission of forms.

Already, APC has ward, council and state executive committees in place.

The party’s Directorate of Organisation had been directed to prepare a schedule of activities and budget for zonal congresses.

The date for the zonal congress, however, will be released after the party leadership has secured the nod of President Buhari on zoning and micro-zoning.

It was gathered that apart from employing the zonal congress to buy more time, the arrangement was put in place by the caretaker committee to perfect the consensus mode of electing new party leaders and flag-bearers for the 2023 general elections.

A source, who pleaded anonymity, said the Caretaker Committee and some governors perfected the zonal congress arrangement while President Buhari was in Belgium and intend to sell the idea to him, with the support of some influential members of the Federal Executive Council.

The source said: “Having conducted congresses from the ward to the state level, the line of argument of the caretaker committee was that it will be proper to have zonal leaders of the party determined at their various geo-political zones for proper inclusiveness of party members.

“Hence, they (CECPC) will be proposing to Mr President the need for zonal congress before the national convention.”

APC governors’ meeting became imperative, following alleged foot-dragging by the caretaker committee.

The meeting may decide whether or not to go ahead with the convention scheduled for February 26.

But most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.

It was learnt that some governors have sent an emissary to President Buhari to feel his pulse on whether or not to postpone the convention.

Speculations about a likely revolt against Buni have made some governors to threaten a boycott of today’s session in Abuja.

The consensus among governors was still on the ceding of the office of the national chairman to the Northcentral.

The fresh proposal to anoint a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara as chairman received “little backing” last night.

According to a source, who spoke in confidence, most APC governors were unhappy with the Caretaker Committee for its ding-dong attitude to the convention.

The source said the governors could not fathom why the caretaker committee was yet to raise sub-committees for the exercise.

The source claimed that the split of the PGF into pro and anti-convention groups has deepened the cracks in the association.

The source said: “All is not well among APC governors over the convention because the Caretaker Committee is unwilling to stick to the agreed February 26 timeline. The committee wants to have its cake and eat it.

“Apart from funding, the Caretaker Committee has come up with an excuse that some off-season elections will hold on the convention date. It is contemplating a shift to March 12.

“Most governors are, however, insisting on February 26 having got wind of a plot to drag the convention till July or August when presidential and other primaries will be conducted. The CECPC members wanted a two-in-one convention.

“There are fears that the shift in convention date was being designed to either favour some members of the CECPC or their cronies for elective offices, including presidential and governorship seats in 2023.

“All these factors have made today’s meeting compelling.”

A governor, who spoke in confidence, said: “It is going to be a make or mar meeting to break the jinx on this convention. We will decide either on going ahead with the convention or a slight postponement which may be the last of such.

“We heard rumours of a new convention date of March 12 but the CECPC has not made recommendations to the PGF. Governors are being turned into ball boys.

“We now have pro and anti-convention governors simply because we can’t keep to an agreement on the date we chose because of 2023 ambitions.

“Left to some of us, we have had enough of CECPC unless the President decides otherwise. This is why there is tension among us.”

It was gathered that some governors were threatening to boycott today’s meeting which they suspected might “put Buni on the spot.”

Another source, who spoke on the intrigues, said: “Those planning to boycott the meeting have become desperate and trying to ensure that the PGF does not have the quorum at today’s meeting.

“They are afraid that governors may join issues with Buni and CECPC at the meeting.

“Some governors sent an emissary to the President last night on the need to intervene and give a definite direction.

“The way we are going, APC is closer to the crisis which made it to lose elections in Zamfara State in 2019.

“There are some forces pulling the strings to create a permanent crisis in APC.”

Many governors have insisted on an APC chairmanship slot for the Northcentral instead of the retention of the office by the Northeast.

It was learnt that the same anti-convention forces came up with the choice of ex-Speaker Yakubu Dogara to “prop up a new issue which could cause fresh confusion in the party.”

Another governor said: “Dogara is a good leader but his candidature is not flying because those behind it are mischievous.

“We had got to a point where some governors who didn’t know how APC was formed are trying to foist crisis on the party. They can’t eat their cake and have it.”","But most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.

"BREAKING: Abba Kyari sues FG, seeks freedom from detention","Suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has dragged the Federal Government to court to seek release from the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, The PUNCH has learnt.

Kyari, in his suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/182/22, is praying the Federal High Court in Abuja to compel the NDLEA to grant him bail on health grounds, pending the hearing and determination of his fundamental right enforcement application.

The anti-narcotics agency had on February 14, 2022, indicted Kyari, ex-head of the police Intelligence Response Team, in alleged drug trafficking and related offences.

The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, subsequently handed over Kyari to the anti-narcotics agency for prosecution over alleged links in drug trafficking after the NDLEA released damning photo and video evidence to nail Kyari.

The NDLEA said Kyari, the suspended IRT head, belonged to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline.

The anti-narcotics agency also said Kyari contacted one of its officers in Abuja and struck a deal to secure the release of a total of 25kg seized cocaine and offered $61,400 bribe to NDLEA officers who played along until his arrest.

The IGP in a statement had corroborated the NDLEA’s findings, saying incontrovertible evidence indicted Kyari in the drug crimes.

How UNIABUJA mismanaged N603m from N2.4bn IGR — Senate,"By Henry Umoru – Abuja

The Senate has raised the alarm over the mismanagement of N603 million from the N2.4billion internally generated revenue, IGR, by management of the University of Abuja.

The Senator Matthew Urhoghide, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Edo South led Senate Committee on Public Accounts Committee, SPAC, sustained the query of Auditor General of the Federation against the university on the said money.

The Auditor General of the Federation had raised concern in the 2017 report over the mismanagement of N603 million out of the N2 4 billion generated Internally by institution. University of Abuja was expected to remit the N603 million into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, CRF, which forms 25 per cent of the revenue generated in the institution.

While responding to the query before the Senate Committee, the Vice Chancellor of University of Abuja , AbdulRasheed Na’Allah, claimed that the money generatediInternally was not enough to run the affairs of the institution, adding that they were, therefore, forced to spend N603 million meant for remittance to the Federation Account.

Na’Allah said: “Peculiarity of the universities in Nigeria is clear and does not have enough IGR to remit to the Consolidated Revenue Fund as adduced by the Auditor General.

“The universities collect only third party revenues from students. Revenue collected are for specific purpose such as union dues , ID card, medical fees, laboratory fees usually refees to other charges.

“Cost recovery concept is adopted by the university, that is charges collected were used to pay for services rendered.

“For instance , ID card charges were used to process ID cards for students. These revenues are not enough for the purpose collected and, therefore, the capacity for the university to remit surplus is lacking”

At the end of the day, Senator Urhoghide, who was represented by the vice chairman of the committee, Senator Ibrahim Hadejia, demanded a refund of the N603 million to the CRF.

The query read. “The Federal Circular Reference No. BO/REV/12235/259/VII/201 dated 11th November, 2011 issued by the Honorable Minister of Finance restricting expenditure on IGR to 75% while 25% is to be remitted to the CRF.

“During the review of financial records and documents, it was observed that the University generated the sum of ¦ 2,413,787,645.48 internally in 2016 and 2017.

“The yearly revenue generated internally was ¦ 1,463,097,604.13 in 2016 and ¦ 950,690,041.35 in 2017.

“Meanwhile, the University failed to remit 25% of its IGR amounting to ¦ 603,446,911.37 to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, CRF.

“Non remittance of the IGR shows lack of control in the expenditure of public fund. Furthermore, funds for developmental purposes is tied down.

“The Vice Chancellor is required to remit the sum of ¦ 603,446,911.37 being 25% of IGR to the CRF immediately and forward evidence of remittance to my Office for confirmation.”

"Gunmen abduct nursing mother in Ogun, collect N3m ransom","James Ogunnaike

ABEOKUTA – Unknown gunmen on Thursday evening abducted a nursing mother along Rounder area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.

The woman, identified as Salimot Ajibola was kidnapped while she was in a car with her husband.

Vanguard gathered that the couple were about driving into their house when the kidnappers attacked them and took the wife away.

It was further learnt that the husband had passed out after the assailants hit him on the head during the attack, but when he later regained consciousness, he discovered that the abductors had made away with his wife, leaving behind their maid and the baby.

“Few hours after her abduction, the kidnappers called the family to demand N25million ransom for her release.

“As negotiations continued, they reduced the ransom to N15million. The family pleaded and they later settled for N3million.

“The N3million was taken to a location described by the kidnappers. After they got the money, Salimot was released on Saturday night.

Speaking with our Correspondent, a relative of the victim, who simply identified herself as Aina said, “this Ogun State, especially Abeokuta, is becoming something else. I never thought this could happen to someone close to me. It’s very sad. The family went through hell to raise the money. The baby was crying for breast. It was just a harrowing experience”.

She added that efforts by the police and local vigilantes to rescue the woman failed as they combed the bushes, but to no avail.

When contacted, the Ogun State Police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident, but said the police was not aware of any ransom paid to effect the release of the abducted woman.

“I am not aware of any ransom paid. But I know she has been released. Whenever people want to pay this money (to the kidnappers), they won’t inform the police.

JUST IN: Court dismisses NBA’s suit on unmarried female police officers,"A Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) seeking to void some provisions in the Nigeria Police Regulations (NPR).

The NBA had argued that the Regulations 126 and 127 of the NPR, made pursuant to the Police Act, conflict with sections 37 and 42 of the Constitution.

Regulation 126 provides: “A married woman police officer, who is pregnant, may be granted maternal leave in accordance with the provisions of the general orders”.

Regulation 127 provides: “An unmarried woman police officer, who becomes pregnant, shall be discharged from the Force and shall not be re-enlisted except with the approval of the Inspector General of Police.”

Section 37 of the Constitution guarantees every Nigerian the right to private and family life, while Section 42 provides for the rights to freedom from discrimination.

Anti-Torture Act: MRA gets court’s nod to move against AGF,"A Federal High Court in Lagos has granted Media Rights Agenda (MRA) leave to apply for an order of mandamus against the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) over the implementation of the Anti-Torture Act, 2017.

The mandamus would compel Malami to exercise the mandatory legal duty stipulated in Section 11 of the Anti-Torture Act, 2017 to make rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the Act.

Justice Tijjani Ringim issued the order following a motion by MRA’s counsel Mrs. Bankeye Akinwale arguing that although Section 11 of the Act mandated the AGF to make rules and regulations, he has failed to do so.

She further contended that despite the enactment of the Act in 2017, there have continued to be various allegations made by journalists, and other individuals and citizens of Nigeria of being subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment by officials of law enforcement agencies and other government officials and non-state actors.

It said in an effort to ensure that the AGF complies with the law, it wrote a letter of demand dated August 20, 2021, to him requesting him to perform the statutory duty imposed on him by the Act, but that the Minister had “failed, neglected and refused” to comply.

Ruling on the motion, Justice Ringim granted the MRA’s prayer but added that the grant of the order is conditional on MRA filing a written undertaking for costs within two days of the ruling in the event that it turns out that the order ought not to have been granted in the first place.

Specifically, the judge authorised MRA to apply for an order of mandamus to compel the AGF to exercise the mandatory legal duty stipulated in Section 11 of the Act and for the organisation to seek the following reliefs:

“A declaration that the AGF’s failure to make rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the Anti-Torture Act, 2017 as imposed on him by Section 11 of the Act is a breach of the law;

“An order of mandamus compelling the AGF to carry out the duty imposed on him by Section 11 of the Act;

“An order of mandamus compelling the AGF to carry out the request contained in MRA’s letter of demand dated August 20, 2021, delivered to him on August 23, 2021, wherein MRA requested him to make the rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the Act;

Governors meet Monday over new APC convention date,"By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintinsin, Abuja

Parley to set agenda for tomorrow’s talks with Buhari

Congresses to hold in zones

With the caretaker committee foot-dragging on plans for the party’s convention slated for Saturday, All Progressives Congress (APC) governors will meet today on the fate of the exercise.

The caretaker committee has not taken the needed steps to make the convention possible aside from notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

“No other steps necessary to show preparation for the convention has been taken by the caretaker committee, hence, the necessity for today’s meeting by the governors,” a source close to the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), said at the weekend.

- Advertisement -

It was learnt that today’s meeting will prepare grounds for tomorrow’s meeting of the governors and members of the Mai Mala-Buni led Caretaker Committee with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.

The meeting was shifted last week to enable the President to travel to Belgium for the European Union-Africa Union (EU-AU) Summit in Brussels.

The President returned on Saturday.

A source said the caretaker committee is planning to ask for a long shift of the convention, but some governors are believed to be angry about this.

They are said to be interested in a two-week shift from February 26 to March 12.

Part of the argument for the shift of date being proposed by the caretaker committee, it was learnt, is the need to hold the zonal congresses to elect the zonal vice chairmen before the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC).

Another argument is that the February 26 date coincides with by-elections in eight APC states.

The Saturday date is shaky because the caretaker committee has failed to unveil pre-convention activities, including zoning, sale of nomination forms, the inauguration of sub-committees and submission of forms.

Already, APC has ward, council and state executive committees in place.

The party’s Directorate of Organisation had been directed to prepare a schedule of activities and budget for zonal congresses.

The date for the zonal congress, however, will be released after the party leadership has secured the nod of President Buhari on zoning and micro-zoning.

It was gathered that apart from employing the zonal congress to buy more time, the arrangement was put in place by the caretaker committee to perfect the consensus mode of electing new party leaders and flag-bearers for the 2023 general elections.

A source, who pleaded anonymity, said the Caretaker Committee and some governors perfected the zonal congress arrangement while President Buhari was in Belgium and intend to sell the idea to him, with the support of some influential members of the Federal Executive Council.

The source said: “Having conducted congresses from the ward to the state level, the line of argument of the caretaker committee was that it will be proper to have zonal leaders of the party determined at their various geo-political zones for proper inclusiveness of party members.

“Hence, they (CECPC) will be proposing to Mr President the need for zonal congress before the national convention.”

APC governors’ meeting became imperative, following alleged foot-dragging by the caretaker committee.

The meeting may decide whether or not to go ahead with the convention scheduled for February 26.

But most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.

It was learnt that some governors have sent an emissary to President Buhari to feel his pulse on whether or not to postpone the convention.

Speculations about a likely revolt against Buni have made some governors to threaten a boycott of today’s session in Abuja.

The consensus among governors was still on the ceding of the office of the national chairman to the Northcentral.

The fresh proposal to anoint a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara as chairman received “little backing” last night.

According to a source, who spoke in confidence, most APC governors were unhappy with the Caretaker Committee for its ding-dong attitude to the convention.

The source said the governors could not fathom why the caretaker committee was yet to raise sub-committees for the exercise.

The source claimed that the split of the PGF into pro and anti-convention groups has deepened the cracks in the association.

The source said: “All is not well among APC governors over the convention because the Caretaker Committee is unwilling to stick to the agreed February 26 timeline. The committee wants to have its cake and eat it.

“Apart from funding, the Caretaker Committee has come up with an excuse that some off-season elections will hold on the convention date. It is contemplating a shift to March 12.

“Most governors are, however, insisting on February 26 having got wind of a plot to drag the convention till July or August when presidential and other primaries will be conducted. The CECPC members wanted a two-in-one convention.

“There are fears that the shift in convention date was being designed to either favour some members of the CECPC or their cronies for elective offices, including presidential and governorship seats in 2023.

“All these factors have made today’s meeting compelling.”

A governor, who spoke in confidence, said: “It is going to be a make or mar meeting to break the jinx on this convention. We will decide either on going ahead with the convention or a slight postponement which may be the last of such.

“We heard rumours of a new convention date of March 12 but the CECPC has not made recommendations to the PGF. Governors are being turned into ball boys.

“We now have pro and anti-convention governors simply because we can’t keep to an agreement on the date we chose because of 2023 ambitions.

“Left to some of us, we have had enough of CECPC unless the President decides otherwise. This is why there is tension among us.”

It was gathered that some governors were threatening to boycott today’s meeting which they suspected might “put Buni on the spot.”

Another source, who spoke on the intrigues, said: “Those planning to boycott the meeting have become desperate and trying to ensure that the PGF does not have the quorum at today’s meeting.

“They are afraid that governors may join issues with Buni and CECPC at the meeting.

“Some governors sent an emissary to the President last night on the need to intervene and give a definite direction.

“The way we are going, APC is closer to the crisis which made it to lose elections in Zamfara State in 2019.

“There are some forces pulling the strings to create a permanent crisis in APC.”

Many governors have insisted on an APC chairmanship slot for the Northcentral instead of the retention of the office by the Northeast.

It was learnt that the same anti-convention forces came up with the choice of ex-Speaker Yakubu Dogara to “prop up a new issue which could cause fresh confusion in the party.”

Another governor said: “Dogara is a good leader but his candidature is not flying because those behind it are mischievous.

“We had got to a point where some governors who didn’t know how APC was formed are trying to foist crisis on the party. They can’t eat their cake and have it.”","But most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.

Barely one month after gunmen in their numbers invaded Galkogo community in Shiroro local government area of Niger state, killing 11 members of the Joint Security TaskForce and unspecified numbers of villagers, they have again launched another attack and burnt down the entire buildings in the community.

The gunmen who invaded the community in the early hours of Monday in about 50 motorcycles, according to the villagers, first of all burnt down the three buildings housing the Joint Security TaskForce under renovation after the last month attack.

The attack which our source said started at about 1:00am on Monday, lasted till 6:00am when the gunmen were seen moving out of the community with sacks loaded with food stuff and other valuables on their motorcycles.

The Chairman of the Council, Mallam Suleiman Chukuba while confirming the latest attack to our correspondent, said the gunmen are not Bandits but Boko Haram, going by the sophistication of the weapons they were said to be carrying, including explosive devices.

One of the explosive devices planted round the community by the gunmen, according to him, went off this morning, destroying a Hilux Van belonging to the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corp (NSCDC) on their way to the community to ascertain the level of destruction by the gunmen.

Only two out of the number of NSCDC in the vehicle survived the explosion and are in critical condition, receiving treatment at a government facility in Minna, the state capital.

“As I speak to you now, no single building is standing in the community, everything was set ablaze and the entire community is deserted. Right now we can not ascertain the total number of people that have being killed, the situation is quite serious.

“These are Boko Haram not Bandits because they were heavily equipped with sophisticated weapons including explosive devices. This morning Civil Defense vehicle ran into one of the explosive devices, their vehicle destroyed and many of them were killed”, he said.

Before the invasion, the gunmen had on Saturday attacked Pelelle, Galape and Gofan Keremi villages in Galkogo district, kidnapping 12 people and injured a number of the villagers.

Galkogo community had remained without security since after the last month attack which left many members of the Joint security TaskForce dead.

Galkogo community serves as a transit root through which the gunmen launch attacks on other communities in the area but the presence of the Joint Security TaskForce had been a stumbling block to them, hence the need to dislodge the security agents through relentless attacks.","The gunmen who invaded the community in the early hours of Monday in about 50 motorcycles, according to the villagers, first of all burnt down the three buildings housing the Joint Security TaskForce under renovation after the last month attack.

"Abba Kyari, others in fresh trouble","From Godwin Tsa, Abuja

A crack team of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is currently investigating a fresh drug scandal linked to the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kari, and members of his Intelligence Response Team (IRT).

The probe, according to competent sources, centred on the seizure of N3 billion worth of a consignment of tramadol in a warehouse in Lagos State.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The illegal drug was said to have been imported into Nigeria by an individual who claimed to be a pharmacist, but was seized by members of the IRT who got wind of it.

The alleged seizure, which took place since last year, according to sources, was not reported to the NDLEA by Abba Kyari’s team.

“I can tell you that the agency is currently investigating the matter. From available information, it means that the IRT may have sold the consignment. But like I said, our investigation will get to the root of the case.”

The NDLEA had, on Monday February 14, declared Kyari wanted for aiding and abetting drug pushing and running his own cartel.

Five hours after the declaration, the Nigerian Police Force handed over the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, and four others to the anti-narcotic agency for interrogation.

The suspects had been in the custody of the agency since Monday, a period exceeding the constitutional time limit for charging an accused person to court.

Meanwhile, a Federal High Court in Abuja will, today, rule on some of the applications filed by the NDLEA, including the one seeking an abridgement of time which was filed on Thursday by lawyers from the agency.

The motion for accelerated hearing is to fast track the determination of the preliminary issues which are condition precedent for the official filing of charges against the suspects.

Others to be charged alongside Kyari are ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu.

Besides the application for the abridgement of time, the agency has equally filed an application seeking a warrant to detain the suspects in its facility beyond the statutory period of 48 hours.

The 1999 Nigerian Constitution clearly states that persons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court within a “reasonable time”.

According to the constitution, the reasonable time means a period of 24 hours when a court of competent jurisdiction is within a radius of 40 kilometres to the police station or a period of two days in any other case.

This implies that the detention of arrested suspects for more than 48 hours without being charged to court is against the provisions of the constitution.","From Godwin Tsa, AbujaA crack team of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is currently investigating a fresh drug scandal linked to the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kari, and members of his Intelligence Response Team (IRT).

Convention: APC mulls 2 weeks shift,"From Romanus Ugwu, & Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja

Barring any counter directive from the Presidency, the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may be postponed till the middle of March due to myriads of factors.

To this end, the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), an umbrella body for governors elected on the APC platform will meet today in Abuja to deliberate on a new date that would be acceptable to all party stakeholders.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

A chieftain of the ruling party told Daily Sun that clear signal that postponement of the convention is inevitable necessitated the governors’ meeting to “try and resolve grey areas threatening the convention.”

The source further revealed that the progressive governors would, after the meeting, visit President Muhammadu Buhari tomorrow to brief him of their resolutions.

“Honestly, I strongly doubt the possibility of the convention holding this weekend as planned. It is almost practically impossible because of reasons already in the public domain. There has not been any attempt to constitute sub-committees, there has been no resolution on the zoning arrangements, no sale of nomination forms and more disturbingly, there has not been serious information on the side of the party’s national leadership. I can confirm to you that the APC governors will be meeting on Monday night. The agenda of the meeting will be to resolve all those grey areas hampering the convention. They will more importantly agree on a new date for the convention. The governors will also meet with President Buhari on Tuesday not only to brief him on the new developments but also to table before him their resolutions on the way forward.”

An administrative staff at the party’s headquarters confirmed that they were in the dark just like most members of the party.

“There is nothing on ground to show that the convention can take place this weekend. We waited with high hopes for the sale of nomination forms last week, but nothing happened. I don’t believe there will be convention this weekend since there is nothing to indicate that. At least, they have not resolved very important issue of zoning arrangements nor have they set up sub-committees. Therefore, there is every reason to doubt the possibility of the convention holding,” the management staff noted.

Meanwhile, President Buhari is expected to meet with Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday at the State House, Abuja.

The meeting which was to hold last Tuesday before it was called off shortly before the President left for Brussels, Belgium to attend the just concluded EU-AU Summit.

Top government sources said the rescheduled meeting which is at the instance of

President Buhari is to look at the national convention of the party fixed for Saturday, February 26, 2022.

According to sources, the date may no longer be feasible as it is less than a week away with no known programme put in place by the party.

The Chairman of the Interim Committee of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni is expected at the meeting which will also have 20 other APC Governors in attendance, to table another possible date and other logistics for approval by President Buhari.

APC youths under the umbrella of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) has petitioned President Buhari, threatening not only a showdown but also to elect a parallel national leadership should the party fail to organise the convention on February 26.

The petition, copied to the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), and signed by Prince Mustapha Audu, read in part: “Mr. President, we want to inform you that prior to your departure for Belgium, the youth wing of the APC which according to the records are 35 million strong, have come together as one indivisible entity. One of the conditions stated for the reconciliation was the date of the APC National convention which has been slated for February 26, 2022.

“As we write this letter, the schedule released by the CECPC for planning towards the conduct of the convention has all been violated. This includes the February 14-19 sale of form date and return of forms deadline, release of zoning arrangements. There are no known members of any committee setup towards the seamless conduct of the supposed upcoming February 26 APC National Convention.

“There has been no formal communication to stakeholders who have been anxiously waiting to participate in the upcoming convention.

"Buhari May Sign Electoral Bill Today, Seeks Lawmakers’ Assurances to Amend Clause 84","•Ruling party’s governors meet tonight in Abuja ahead of meeting with president tomorrow

Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja

All things being equal, President Muhammadu Buhari, has agreed to sign the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill and may in fact sign the bill today but on the condition that the National Assembly would amend the contentious Clause 84, which infringes on the constitutional rights of certain category of people. The contentious aspect bars political appointees from contesting elections and voting as delegates, either at conventions or congresses, after assenting to it.

The president, who already met with the leadership of the two chambers of the National Assembly was awaiting assurances from the leadership of the National Assembly to amend the bill after signing it into law. “The President wants to put this behind us but simply wants assurances so as not not to allow this to continue to be a distraction on the country. He doesn’t want other good aspects of the bill to continue to suffer.”

Also, the president is expected to meet with governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) tomorrow at the State House, Abuja, to address concerns relating to the proposed February 26 national convention of the party.

But this is not going to be before a meeting of the APC governors tonight in Abuja, where they want to take a final look at the situation and issues relating to the convention before engaging the president tomorrow, and ultimately a decision.

Buhari, last night, decided to lay the issues stalling the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to rest, when he seized the initiative and met with the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to finding a middle ground and closing the deal once and for all.

The president was said to have earlier met with the Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase, and the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who is the Chairman of the amendment committee, deputised by Wase, on how to resolve the controversial Clause 84 of the new amendment.

According to sources, the president had only asked if they would be willing to expunge the contentious aspect after he signs the bill so that the political turf could be cleared of the electoral bill crisis. According to a source with knowledge of the ongoing conversation, the president is seeking comfort and assurances that the aspect that infringes on the constitutional rights of Nigerians would be brought in conformity to the constitution through an amendment after he has signed to avoid further delay to the take off of the bill.”

But as at last night, THISDAY could not glean from the leadership of the National Assembly if they had agreed to the president’s proposal, but feelers from the Villa, indicated that once the Buhari gets the assurance of the the legislative leadership to address the grey area, he would move swiftly to sign the bill, possibly today.

There had been misgivings about the new amendment, which had also fuelled speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law.

The latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling APC, were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.

This is because the harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature and considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives, had inserted a controversial Clause 84 into the amendment bill.

The implication of the Clause 84 was that all political appointees in President Buhari’s government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.

Also, by the provision at issue, political appointees were further barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.

Unlike what was obtainable in the past, when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party’s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace was no longer available with the new proposal.

According to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.

“Where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.

“Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.

“Nothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.”

Unfortunately, there was a lacuna in the new law, which encouraged infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.

The Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.

Sources, however, believed that the clause was meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often controlled those who became automatic delegates and determined the outcome of congresses.

Sources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the “one house” impression by the National Assembly.

But the fear being expressed by many was that, with a clause that clearly breached the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again, and that if that happened, a new electoral law might not be ready for the 2023 elections, hence the new rapprochement by the president.

Buhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.

The bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: “A political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.”

But Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.

The president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties’ inability to muster funds for it.

Buhari Meets Governors Tomorrow

However, the president’s meeting with governors over the national convention tomorrow, was initially scheduled to hold last Tuesday but was called off shortly before the president proceeded on a four-day official visit to Brussels, Belgium, to attend the EU-AU Summit.

Sources told THISDAY at the weekend that the rescheduled meeting, which is at the instance of President Buhari, is to look at the national convention of the party fixed for Saturday, February 26, 2022.

Some stakeholders have been pushing for a postponement of the convention citing logistical challenge and planning issues. They pointed out that the February 26 date was no longer feasible. Ultimately however it is the President’s decision to make whether to go ahead or not. And as at this early morning he had not made that call.

The meeting with the President, which will be led by the Chairman of the Interim Committee of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, with 20 other APC Governors in attendance, would now table another possible date and other logistics for approval by President Buhari.

The interim leadership of the party was said to be pushing for the convention to be moved by two weeks to mid March but it will have to seek the approval of President Buhari in his capacity as the National leader of the APC.

This was the same step Buni-led interim committee took last December, when it approached the President to approve the February 26 date, which President Buhari gladly did.

The same scenario may play out as the President might accede to the extension of the date for the convention being proposed by some of the party leaders.

APC Governors Meet Tonight

Worried by the turn of events over the national convention of APC, governors elected on the platform of the party are billed to meet tonight in Abuja, to take a final stand on the matter as well as decide whether to go ahead or shift the date of the convention.

Some of the governors, whom THISDAY gathered were unhappy with both the president and party leadership, hinted that the meeting tonight would be the final one on the convention and that the outcome may be unpleasant as a majority of them were ready to go all out.

Party sources, who also hinted at some of the happenings in the APC, however, pointed at the Imo State Governor, Uzodinma and his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, as the arrowheads of those pushing for a postponement of the convention.

According to party sources, the duo of Uzodinma and Bello, were the ones orchestrating the postponement, because they were said to be comfortable with the current caretaker committee through whom they’ve been able to push many agenda and were therefore striving hard to ensure they stall the convention.

“Isn’t it unfortunate that people, who had no idea how this party came about are the ones causing the current commotion in our party? Can you imagine Hope and Bello holding the party to ransom over completely self-serving reasons, which do not even align with collective interest.

“I hope the meeting of the governors tonight is not going to be where they would throw it all out through the window, because this is absolutely ridiculous. What is the sense in the postponement of the convention, when we can actually tidy up everything in two or three days?

“Really, what do we need to get this done? With a unity list, the convention would be over in no time, because we’d be going only to ratify the list. So, why stalling the entire party and by extension the country?

“Why is the chairman acting as if he is not in charge? The whole thing is just disappointing and honestly, I’m ashamed how the governors allowed two people without a stake in the party to drive them to this shameful station,” said the party source.

Stakeholders Insist Convention Must Go on as Planned

Already, many stakeholders of the APC had claimed that except the president said otherwise, the proposed national convention of the party was unlikely.

THISDAY further gathered at the weekend that although some members of the party, who were opposed to the convention holding as scheduled, had begun to shop for an injunction to stop the exercise, the caretaker committee leadership of the party was also ready to go ahead with convention plans nonetheless.

This is as the youths of the party, under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM),had declared their readiness for the APC national convention on February 26, if the caretaker committee could not carry out the task.

At the same time, some stakeholders in party had listed a few of the factors believed should guide the choice of the new chairman of the party, citing particularly, a corruption-free individual without cases with any of the anti-corruption agencies.

However, with the convention not likely to hold again, THISDAY gathered that the only person, who could have approved that the exercise goes on or be postponed at this stage was President Buhari, who unfortunately, has remained quiet about it until the Tuesday meeting was slated.

While some members of the party had expressed concerns over the level of preparedness for an exercise that is scheduled to hold this weekend, including the zoning of offices and the sales of nomination form that have yet to take off, THISDAY gathered that all of those would be resolved in no time the moment Buhari gives a direction on the convention.

But whether or not the president agrees to go ahead with the convention as scheduled for this weekend after tomorrow’s meeting, some members of the party were alleged to have started shopping for an injunction to stop the exercise from holding.

APC Youths Offer to Assist with Convention

Meanwhile, leader of the Progressive Youth Movement, Mustapha Audu, in an open letter to Buhari, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), lamented that overriding personal interest had made it impossible to conduct the national convention of the ruling APC.

He, however, maintained that, “The country is watching, and Mr. President has been promised a date of February 26th, 2022, for the APC National Convention. Any attempt to move this date shows that there is no regard for honesty or integrity, and this dents our image in the eyes of all Nigerians.”

According to him, the convention date was decided over two months ago and the caretaker committee has had more than enough time to put its house in order.

“We want to reassure Mr. President that we, as young stakeholders, stand ready to conduct the National Convention come February 26th 2022 if the current CECPC cannot carry out the task,” the APC youth said, decrying that the schedule of activities released by the caretaker committee for planning towards the conduct of the convention had all been violated.

He said these included the February 14 sale of forms date, release of zoning arrangements, the return of completed forms, which was supposed to be the deadline date.

His words: “Holding a convention is not a difficulty as we carried out the previous ward, local government, state congresses and national convention within 12 days in 2018 between May 2nd and May 14th, 2018.

“However, the overriding personal interest this time around has unfortunately made it nearly impossible to conduct the national convention in over 20 months since the establishment of the CECPC in June 2020.”

Also, a document titled: “Our Position On Consensus National Chairman” by some concerned members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and South-South Emerging Leaders’ Forum (SELF), had stated that the party would converge for the national convention and that the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led committee would hand over the baton of leadership to a set of newly-elected executives.

According to the document, members said that their views were no longer needed as executive committee members, notwithstanding the fact that top of the convention’s checklist was the election of a new national chairman, after the controversial suspension of Adams Oshiomhole left a huge vacuum in 2021.

“In fact, reports from some quarters have attributed to the plethora of internal conflicts and unending chaos at some state branches to the lack of an arrowhead, who will steer the activities of the party.

“To them, the APC needs a leader, who will bridge the gaps across different ranks of the political group and maintain a cohesive force to retain power in the 2023 general election.

“So, for the sustenance of a zoning arrangement that is workable, the party stalwarts have decided to allow the North-Central zone to produce the next Chairman, thus eliminating Northeasterners and people from other geopolitical zones from the race.

“This entails that contestants with an edge include Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (Niger State), Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura (Nasarawa State), Mallam Saliu Mustapha (Kwara State), ex-Governor George Akume (Benue State), Mohammed Etsu (Niger State), Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa State) and former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Abu Bawa Bwari (Niger State).

“As Nigeria’s biggest political party shops for a new Chairman, we hereby examine some factors that may determine, who wears the crown from the North Central zone,” the stakeholders said.

According to the document under “Integrity test”, the stakeholders said, “Since the 2023 election is fast approaching, some have said the party may shoot itself in the leg by producing anyone, who has corruption cases hanging around his neck.”

This, according to the proponents, was to avoid providing the opposition with an opportunity to rubbish the party’s integrity.

They urged leaders of the party not to elect as chairman, some former governors and individuals, who have been indicted for financial crimes by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-graft agencies.

They said it would be out of place for the APC to elect as national chairman and head of the National Working Committee (NWC), a person, who is indicted by the EFCC and other like agencies.

Another criterion listed is the alleged intra-state rivalry, stating that political observers had contended that the failure of some states to produce a consensus candidate might thwart the chances of some candidates.

They equally cited the age factor, saying, “If the words of President Muhammadu Buhari are to be banked on, age might be a factor in the chairmanship race.”

They argued that the president, while hosting members of the APC National Lobby Group, at the State House, said it was time to give younger elements in the party the benefit to aspire to leadership in the party.

How Presidency’s Intervention Speeded up Kyari’s Arrest,"Micheal Olugbode in Abuja

Fresh facts have emerged on the process leading to the arrest of “super cop” Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari and his subsequent hand over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) last week.

In a dramatic move on February 14, NDLEA at a world press conference declared wanted Kyari, who had been suspended from his duties months ago following his indictment by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for alleged involvement with Internet fraudster, Hushpuppi, in cyber-criminal activities.

The move became necessary following the reluctance by the police high command to accede to the request by the anti-drug agency to release Kyari for interrogation.

“But for the direct intervention by the presidency after the press conference questioning the delay in arresting and handing over Kyari to the NDLEA, the police high command would probably have continued to dither on the request to hand him over for interrogation,” a presidency source said.

Having assembled a watertight case, with graphic video evidence, photographs, audio recordings, WhatsApp chats, etc., against Kyari and his men, NDLEA, it was gathered, briefed the president and other persons that needed to know in the presidency of the depth of Kyari’s involvement in the drug ring. After securing the nod of the presidency to move against Kyari, the drug agency approached the Inspector General of Police.

The source revealed, “The NDLEA chairman, Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), went ahead to brief the IGP, who by this time was unaware that the president had been briefed. The IG was presented some of the damning evidence gathered against Kyari and his co-conspirators, urging him to release Kyari to the agency for interrogation.

“The IGP promised the NDLEA that Kyari was going to be handed over to them on Thursday, February 10, but that did not happen. Friday also came and went, and nothing was done. The drug agency waited all through that weekend, but nothing happened. And Kyari who, apparently, had become aware of the request suddenly became unreachable to the agency.

“Meanwhile, Kyari had started calling everyone in the presidency he thought could do something to put pressure on NDLEA to back off from arresting him.”

THISDAY checks revealed that the press conference by NDLEA was a pre-emptive move following a tip-off to checkmate an alleged plot by the police high-ups to shield the wanted cop from arrest by the anti-drug agency, according sources briefed on the matter.

Presidency sources told THISDAY, “The NDLEA got intelligence that the police were planning to change the narrative by parading some persons as suspects over the matter. It was when they (NDLEA) got wind of the move that they knew the police wanted to turn the case around. That was why they hurriedly addressed that world press conference last Monday.

“And immediately after the media briefing and reactions were pouring from across the world, the presidency called the IGP and directed him to ensure that Kyari was released to the NDLEA immediately. At this stage, the police high-ups who had been shielding Kyari all along knew the game was up and had to arrest him immediately.”

The erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigeria Police was subsequently arrested and handed over to the drug law enforcement agency that Monday evening about 5 pm.

Kyari has been accused by the drug-fighting agency of being a member of a drug-dealing cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline.

Alongside Kyari, four other suspects in the matter, namely, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba; and Inspector John Nuhu are presently being interrogated and further investigation being carried out on their alleged involvement in cocaine dealings, at the headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja.

John Umoru, also a key member of the Abba Kyari gang, who goes by the nickname “Too much money”, is presently at large. The Police Service Commission had directed the IGP, Usman Baba, to ensure Umoru’s arrest.

THISDAY gathered that the drug-fighting agency has watertight case backed with solid evidence against Kyari and the others.

Kyari, despite being on suspension, was said to have still carried on with his despicable acts. The source disclosed that there were more than 10 audio evidences, five video evidences, and pictures, stressing that what the NDLEA did was a “clean job.”

The source stated, “The fact is that Kyari was being shielded from being extradited to the US by the police leadership, which was terrible enough case and worse for a senior police officer to be dealing in cocaine.

“The modus operandi of Kyari and his men was that once they get information about banned drugs that were imported, such as tramadol, they would impound the items from the importer that brought them into the country and sell them to another cartel. That is, they take from one cartel and go and sell to another.

“He is a billionaire and we learnt that in his confessional statement he revealed that he owns properties in choice locations in Lagos and Abuja. He owns an estate in Lekki, in Lagos, he has a house in Victoria Island, he has an estate in Asokoro in Abuja, and another estate at Guzape, Abuja, that is to let you know how corrupt this young man, who was on his way to becoming the IGP of the NPF, was.”

THISDAY checks also revealed that the anti-drug agency last week filed an ex parte action in court to detain Kyari and his men for two weeks to allow it more time to conclude its investigation. He and his conspirators may be charged to court in the next two to three weeks.

Meanwhile, more trouble appears imminent for Kyari, as NDLEA launches a probe into the seizure of a large consignment of Tramadol, an illegal drug, in Lagos.

Sources close to NDLEA said Kyari and other had been linked to the alleged seizure of a large consignment of Tramadol in a warehouse at the Amuwo-Odofin area of Lagos. It was gathered that someone who claimed to be a pharmacist imported the consignment worth N3 billion into Nigeria.

It was learnt that the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), allegedly, got information on the consignment and stormed the warehouse where the illegal drug was stocked, leading to the seizure.

Sources at NDLEA said the agency ought to have been told of the seizure, which allegedly took place last year, but the Kyari team kept the information from the agency.

“What this means is that the IRT may have sold the consignment of Tramadol to a cartel after storming the Amuwo Odofin warehouse and seizing the Tramadol,” a source said. “We have launched a probe into the case with a view to getting to the root of the matter,” the source added.

Spokesman of NDLEA, Mr. Femi Babafemi, said no stone would be left unturned in ensuring that all suspects already in custody and those that might still be indicted in the course of investigation faced the full weight of the law. Babafemi said the war by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari against drug was uncompromising, adding that the on-going case “showed a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld.”

The spokesman said the NDLEA had a trove of intelligence, hard facts, from chats to photos and video, and a detailed transcript of the communication between Kyari and officers of the agency.

He said, “It is disheartening to hear straight from the horse’s mouth the kind of sleaze engaged in by this team of rogue law enforcement agents led by Kyari, the members of whom he described this way: ‘the boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal.’”

Kyari had solved many criminal cases and was until recently among the most celebrated police officers in the country. But he found himself in troubled waters when he was associated with Hushpuppi’s cybercrime case. An American court ordered his deportation to the United States to be prosecuted along with Abbas Ramon, alias Hushpuppi, a request the Nigerian government was yet to respond to.

"From $380bn Loss in 50 Years, Nigeria’s Oil Industry Begins In-country Annual Retention of $8bn","•50,000 jobs created since creation of NOGICD Act, says Wabote

•Local oil firms now produce 60% of Nigeria’s domestic gas

Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

From a whopping $380 billion loss in capital flight due to the absence of an enabling law for retention of capital in the oil and gas industry, Nigeria currently has an annual in-country retention of $8 billion under the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act. Executive Secretary of Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, stated this in Lagos during a meeting with editors.

Wabote revealed that about two million jobs were also lost during the 50 years that the country’s oil and industry operated without a capital retention law. But he said at least 50,000 jobs had so far been created with the implementation of the NOGICD Act.

Over the past 11 years, Wabote stated that the level of Nigerian content in the oil industry, which was about five per cent before the enactment of the act in 2010, had increased to 26 per cent in 2016 and 42 per cent as at December 2021.

He explained, “Before now, there was revenue focus with little emphasis on in-country value addition, with massive capital flight of over $380 billion and an estimated two million job loss over a 50-year period, while the local content in the oil and gas industry was less than five per cent.”

Wabote explained that NCDMB launched a Nigerian content 10-year strategic roadmap in 2017, with the target to achieve 70 per cent Nigerian content by 2027. As part of this goal, the board, he noted, would catalyse the creation of 300, 000 direct jobs in the oil and gas industry and linkage sectors and enable the retention of $13 billion out of the estimated annual $20 billion spend in the oil and gas industry.

The NCDMB helmsman hinted that a pointer to the marked improvement in Nigerian content implementation was that the local economy used to retain little or nothing from the annual oil industry spend of $20 billion before the Act. The $8 billion in-country retention per year was possible, according to him, due to the development of critical capacities and assets by local oil and gas service companies and increased domiciliation and domestication of industry operations.

Wabote said Nigeria had also moved from near zero participation in the operations side of the oil and gas sector to the point where indigenous operators, such as Seplat, Aiteo, Eroton, and others, were now responsible for 15 per cent of the country’s oil production and 60 per cent of domestic gas supply.

Other major accomplishments of Nigerian content implementation included the establishment of two world-class pipe mills and five pipe coating yards, enabling Nigerian firms to fabricate more than 250,000 tonnes of steel per year, and ownership of more than 40 per cent of marine vessels used in the industry, he stated.

Wabote added that over 10 million training man-hours had been delivered via the board’s human capacity development programme, thereby enabling the indigenous workforce to sustain oil production at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

Providing details of the board’s credit facilities to the oil and gas industry, Wabote said NCDMB had inaugurated a $50 million Nigerian Content Research and Development Fund to drive basic research, commercialisation of research breakthroughs, establishment of research centres of excellence, and sponsorship of university endowments. He added that the board floated a $50 million special loan product for women in the oil and gas business to enable empowerment of the womenfolk in the industry, managed by Nexim (Nigerian Export-Import) Bank, and established another $30 million working capital fund to support oil and gas service companies.

The NCDMB executive secretary announced that the agency recently secured the approval of its Governing Council to set up a $50 million fund for a manufacturing product line, to be dedicated to companies that would operate in the Nigerian oil and gas parks. He said this was being constructed by the board in Bayelsa and Cross River states, explaining that the beneficiaries of the fund would have to be engaged in the manufacturing of equipment components used in the oil and gas industry and linkage sectors.

Wabote stated that NCDMB convened the breakfast meeting with the managements of the media organisations to enable senior members of the media understand the importance of Nigerian content to the economy.

He added that the COVID-19 pandemic made humanity realise that every economy needed to develop local capacities and capabilities in the core sectors, hence, all hands must now be on deck to push the local content narrative.

He charged media practitioners to uphold the ethics of the profession, noting that Nigerians depend on the media for many decisions.

However, Wabote regretted that some online media platforms were undermining the federal government’s intentions of bringing in technocrats and professionals to serve as appointees through targeted and unwarranted attacks.

Speaking at the event, Manager, Corporate Communications, NCDMB, Mr. Esueme Kikile, noted that media practitioners were key partners in the implementation of the NOGICD Act. Kikile solicited the support of the media to curb the incidence of fake news and libellous publications.

He assured the media of the board’s continuous partnership and support.

"Terror-linked Minister, Pantami Had Poor Record Of Service As Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Lecturer — Nigerian Lecturers’ Union, ASUU","The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has indicted Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, over his appointment as a professor of Cybersecurity by the Federal University of Technology, (FUTO), Owerri in Imo State.



According to a report by the National Executive Committee of the union, Pantami had a poor record of service during his stint as a lecturer in Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University hence does not qualify to be appointed as a professor.

The report, signed by the majority of the members of the committee and obtained by SaharaReporters, showed that queries and caution bordering on the negligence of duty characterised the Minister's stay at ATBU.



It also noted that Pantami had failed to keep up with a condition attached to a study fellowship he clinched from 2010 to 2013.



The Minister reportedly got the fellowship with the condition to work for the University (ATBU) upon return for twice the period of the study. He, however, resigned from the university a year after getting the PhD.



Items 14 to 16 under observation reads: “Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim has a poor record of service from his former place of work at ATBU as evidenced by several queries and caution bordering on the negligence of duty.

“The career progression of Dr Isa Ibrahim shows that he obtained his B.Tech in Computer Science, second class lower at ATBU in 2002, M.Sc. Computer Science in 2009 and PhD in 2014 from Roben Gordon University, Aberdeen. In 2010 he was promoted to lecturer II and lecturer I in 2014.



“After obtaining his PhD, he picked up an appointment with Medinah University as Assistant Professor before returning to ATBU, Bauchi. He resigned from his appointment with ATBU, Bauchi in 2015.

"EXCLUSIVE: Report Exposes Illegal Process, Fraud In Appointment Of Terror-linked Buhari's Minister, Isa Pantami As University Professor","A damning report has revealed how the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), Imo State, followed an illegal and fraudulent process in the appointment of terror-linked Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, as a professor of cyber security.

The report, conducted by a six-man committee of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and obtained by SaharaReporters on Monday, exposed how three deputy vice-chancellors intimidated ASUU FUTO congress by their presence at a meeting where Pantami’s issue was discussed, ensuring a professorial fraud.

The six-man committee is headed by Daniel Gungula, with the report dated February 12, 2022.

SaharaReporters observed that the committee in its report made recommendations that Pantami’s professorship was a fraud and should be discountenanced.

The report said, “After exhaustive interactions with relevant stakeholders, the committee wishes to observe as follows; one the immediate past chairperson, Dr Chris Echereobia, failed to guide the branch excos (Executive Council) and congress adequately. Information and directive from the zone were not properly relayed to the exco members.

“The issue of due process as regards the promotion of Dr Isa Pantami to the rank of a professor should not have risen in the first place because he was not qualified to apply for the position of the professor of cyber security in FUTO. His PhD could just earn him Lecturer 1. At no point was he a senior lecturer, not to talk of a reader (associate professor).

“The appointment of Dr Isa Ibrahim (Pantami) as a professor of cyber security by FUTO council did not follow the rules and regulations of the university and did not conform to the condition specified in the advertisement.

“Based on the findings above, the committee wishes to recommend to NEC as follows; NEC should reject the appointment of Dr Isa Ibrahim as a professor of Cyber Security since he was not qualified and due process was not followed in the appointment. NEC should direct her members not to recognise, accord or treat Dr Isa Pantami as a professor of cyber security. NEC should sanction all individuals who participated or facilitated the illegal appointment and promotion exercise.”

US-based professor, Farooq Kperogi, also highlighted further findings in the report.

He said, “Pantami has no office in the Department of Cyber Security, and the HOD has never seen him. Contrary to FUTO’s tradition where a committee of deans examines professorial appointments, only one Professor G.A. Chukwudebe examined Pantami’s application. But Chukwudebe is NOT a professor of cyber security; he is a professor of electrical engineering.

“Pantami was 'promoted' (yes, PROMOTED) from Reader to Professor even though he was never a Reader anywhere in the world. He was Lecturer I at ATBU and an early career Assistant Professor (equivalent to Lecturer I) at the Islamic University of Madinah. ASUU members who participated in Pantami's professorial fraud should be suspended from the union for a year, and the VC, Nnenna Oti, should be suspended from the union indefinitely.” See Also News Federal University Owerri Alumni Kick Against Professorship Appointment For Terror-linked Isa Pantami

SaharaReporters had reported that the FUTO alumni association said the award of professorship on Isa Patami was inappropriate.

This was contained in a statement co-signed by Kingsley Azuaru, National Secretary, and Ndubuisi Chijioke, National President of the association.

The association had said ASUU was right in advising FUTO management to reconsider the appointment.

“FUTO Alumni Association reaffirms her position that the professorship of Pantami was inappropriate

“FUTO Alumni Association appreciates the national body of ASUU and the local chapter for jointly condemning the appointment of Pantami as a professor in FUTO.

“NEC also considered the unresolved issue of the appointment of Dr. Isa Pantami as a Professor at our alma mater and has taken note of the National ASUU position.

“The National Secretary, therefore, reaffirmed FUTO alumni association’s position that Pantami’s appointment was inexplicable and questionable,” it had said.

Instead of reviewing the professorship, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Nnenna Oti, said the management had gone to court over the rejection of Pantami’s promotion to the rank as a professor of Cyber Security by the institution.","A damning report has revealed how the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), Imo State, followed an illegal and fraudulent process in the appointment of terror-linked Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, as a professor of cyber security.

"Conducting Census For The Living And The Living Dead, By Owei Lakemfa","Life in Nigeria is very cheap and living is very costly. But please don’t ask me for the statistics because they are hard to come by Registration of birth, especially in the rural areas is not common, but more uncommon is that of death; the general attitude is ‘God gives and God takes’. So why worry about a death certificate?

Weekly, there are reports of killings across the country, especially by terrorists, kidnappers and bandits. Some of these hold territory, run court and impose taxes, and all institutions, including the security services and governments, seem unable or incapable of defending the citizenry. The result is the mass exodus to various parts of the country like Abuja and neigbouring countries like Cameroun that are thought to be safer.

The Buhari administration thinks that given this scenario, there is the need to know how many Nigerians are still surviving, how many foreigners have flowed in, how many bandits, especially from Central and West Africa have crossed into the country. These groups have complicated our problems by leaving villages and towns deserted and ruining lives.

Also, given arrested social progress, ever rising inflation, hunger and the imperative of borrowing from abroad, there is the need for the country to have some reliable population count so we will ever be conversant with the ratio of population to external borrowings. As some have argued, borrowing shows the good health of our economy as the rich would not want to extend loan facilities to the insolvent.

Ordinarily, census is supposed to give reliable data with which to plan and determine the basic needs for schools, hospitals, roads and other infrastructure. That cannot be the reason for the Buhari government conducting census because it is doing wonderfully well without statistics. In any case, you do not need census to tell you that out of school children should be in school. In the case of this government, even schools for such children built by the previous administration, were abandoned.

In 2012, the Jonathan administration set out to build 400 schools in the North to vastly improve education in that part of the country. At least, 165 of these integrated Amajiri schools were opened, some with integrated language laboratories and health clinics. But when the Buhari administration came to power, many of these schools were shut down, some seized by state governments and many underutilized with the students roaming the streets.

So why would it worry itself with planning for basic needs when it has only 15 months to go in an eight-year renewed tenure? It might have to do more with the allocation of funds and justification of why in a country where 90 per cent contribute little or nothing to the national purse, the producers get little, and the non-producers get the lion share.

The digital census which is coming with a princely tag of N178.09 billion is needed at this time of want, and when free money needs to be sourced for the 2023 elections.

All these should not be misconstrued as my being allergic to census. No, I love it because it will show that while Nigeria may well be big for nothing, at least, it has the largest population of Black people in the world. That feeling can be soothing.

The last census in 2006 gave us a population of 140 million which some states challenged. Our current estimated population, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, is 206 million. I bet we are way more than that as the new census might also include estimated figures which would be handy in politicians negotiating among themselves.

Census is not really value free as it has its own politics. For example, the South rejected the provisional results of the 2006 census which had Kano with 9.4 million as the most populous state followed by Lagos State with nine million people. That census had the North with 75 million people and the South, 65 million. The then Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, demanded a recount, insisting that the state which led the 1991 Census and had since then developed into a mega city as attested to by the international community, cannot have less population than Kano State.

He argued that a parallel census the state had conducted in collaboration with the National Population Commission had over 17.5 million people; so the 9.0 million given it was fraudulent. The Pan Igbo umbrella group, Ohanaeze said the 2006 census was used as a political weapon to present Igbo as a minority populace. Then president, Olusegun Obasanjo, said Nigerians were free to do whatever they liked with that census. It is not known if the final population figures were released, but what is certain is that no store was put on this population exercise. It was a waste of resources. The first national census in 1953 conducted by the British colonialists was controversial and rejected, as were those of 1962, 1963 and 1973.

Let me commend President Muhammadu Buhari for forging ahead with his census programme because only a courageous leader would conduct a census when many parts of the country are under the control of local and foreign invaders, terrorists and bandits. Unless a decision has been taken to estimate the population, how do you conduct census in parts of the country under occupation?

I do not take the joke of the Chairman of the NPC, Nasir Isa Kwarra, serious. He boasts that the commission has the capacity to tackle insecurity in all the states of the federation during the census. If for 13 years the entire Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies have been unable to defeat the Boko Haram, and cannot put down rampaging banditry and kidnapping, how does a civil commission like his hope to marshal the necessary firepower and security to overrun these groups during the census? Does he hope to bring in American and Russians troops to do the job?

If population were linked with production and taxation rather than free consumption, the figures would be more reliable and less contentious. By the way, what is the whole essence of the National Identification Number, NIN, which is assigned to every Nigerian at the completion of enrolment into the National Identity Data Base?

In a country where elections are rigged with impunity, doubts will always be created by a new population census even if they are conducted by angels. So the May, 2022 census may just be another round of controversy and acrimony. Who knows, that might well be the motive; at least it would divide Nigerians on ethno-regional basis and divert attention from the pressing challenges of insecurity, hunger and living in conditions unsuitable for human beings.","That cannot be the reason for the Buhari government conducting census because it is doing wonderfully well without statistics.

BREAKING: Court refuses to hear DCP Abba Kyari's application for bail,"A federal high court in Abuja has refused to hear an application by Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP), seeking bail from custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on the grounds of ill health.

In an ex parte application brought before the court on Monday, Kyari through his counsel, Cynthia Ikenna, told the court that his health has deteriorated.

Ikenna prayed the court to release her client who is diabetic and hypertensive on bail pending the determination of the substantive suit.

She said the substantive matter is a fundamental human right suit in which Kyari is challenging the false allegations against him.

However, Inyang Ekwo, the judge, ordered the applicant to put the respondents on notice.

” Upon studying the process of the applicant and the averments in support of the application, I am of the opinion that the respondents be put on notice so they can answer to the averments. Therefore, applicant is hereby ordered to put the respondents on notice of all the processes in this matter,” he held.

He adjourned the matter till Thursday for hearing of the application.

On February 14, the NDLEA declared Kyari wanted “over his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal”. Hours later, the police announced his arrest and subsequent transfer to the NDLEA custody.

The NDLEA’s revelation comes months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari of conspiring with Hushpuppi, self-confessed international fraudster, in a $1.1 million scam targeting Qatari business people.

The FBI secured a court order for Kyari’s extradition and arrest over his alleged involvement in the Hushpuppi fraud.","In an ex parte application brought before the court on Monday, Kyari through his counsel, Cynthia Ikenna, told the court that his health has deteriorated.

NNPC: Nigeria's marginal fields produced 46m barrels of crude in one year,"Nigeria produced 45.59 million barrels of oil through marginal fields from August 2020 to July 2021 — the lowest yield from various production arrangements.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited said this in its latest financial and operations report for August 2021.

Marginal fields are smaller oil blocks developed by indigenous companies, and they have not been exploited in at least the last ten years. These fields are often discovered by international oil companies (IOCs) but remain inactive due to their decision to withdraw from further production activities.

In May 2021, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) — now NUPRC — had completed the first successful bid programme after 18 years.

Advertisement

Over 600 companies had applied to be pre-qualified for the bid rounds of 57 marginal fields, which began on June 1, 2020.

Other arrangements through which Nigeria produces its oil are joint ventures (JVs), production sharing contracts (PSCs), alternative funding (AF) and through the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the NNPC.

Under JVs, Nigeria produced 172 million barrels of oil for the period under review. PSCs contributed 240 million barrels, and 59.4 million barrels produced under alternative funding, and NPDC produced 58.19 million barrels.

Advertisement

The total production culminated in 575.28 million barrels from August 2020 to July 2021, with an average daily production of 1.58 million barrels.

In July 2021, a total of 47.55 million barrels of crude oil and condensate were produced, representing an average daily production of 1.53 million barrels.

Condensate is a mixture of light liquid hydrocarbons produced as a byproduct during hydrocarbon drilling.

According to the report, July 2021 production figure comprises 38.75 barrels (1.22 mbd) of crude, pure condensate of 6.79m barrels and spiked condensate of 1.99m barrels.","Nigeria produced 45.59 million barrels of oil through marginal fields from August 2020 to July 2021 — the lowest yield from various production arrangements.

Court strikes out suit challenging Atiku's eligibility to run for president,"A federal high court in Abuja has struck out a suit challenging the citizenship of Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president.

The suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/177, challenged Atiku’s eligibility to run for president on the premise that he is not a Nigerian citizen by birth.

The Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa, the plaintiff, had filed the suit in 2019 and challenged Atiku’s eligibility to contest for president.

Nigeria’s constitution stipulates that one must be a citizen by birth to become the country’s president.

Advertisement

The group joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and Abubakar Malami, the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), as co-defendants in the suit.

The plaintiff had told the court that considering the provisions of sections 25 (1) & (2) and 131(a) of the constitution and the circumstances surrounding his birth, the former vice-president cannot contest for the top office.

Malami, in an affidavit to support the suit, had said Atiku is not a Nigerian citizen by birth and therefore, not eligible to run for president in Nigeria.

Advertisement

However, in the judgment delivered on Monday, Inyang Ekwo, the judge, dismissed the suit for lacking merit.

Ekwo described the plaintiff as a “busy body”, who had no locus standi to query the citizenship of the former vice-president.

The judge held that the NGO, having been registered under Company and Allied Matters Act with and special functions, cannot jump into public interest litigation that is not part of its objectives.

He cautioned NGOs to refrain from filing frivolous applications targeted at harassing politically-exposed Nigerians.

He concluded that since the plaintiff was bereft of locus standi, the court lacked the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the case.","A federal high court in Abuja has struck out a suit challenging the citizenship of Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president.

"Flutterwave 3.0, Google’s Android Privacy Sandbox, Africa-produced mRNA vaccines","Share this article:













Good day,

In the last few weeks, on every social media platform I use — mainly Twitter and WhatsApp — one of the first things I see is “Wordle 2/6” or “Wordle 1/6”, followed by some green, yellow, and white squares.

Now don’t get me wrong; I’m not hating or anything, but I’m not a huge fan of Wordle or the other variants springing up like quordle, octordle, and semantle.

And with new ownership comes some changes. In January 2022, The New York Times acquired Wordle from the creator, Josh Wardle, for an undisclosed sum.

So far, there’s been screening of “offensive words” and what appears to be significantly more ad-tracking. At least the game is still free, though.

Meanwhile, on Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia are the chosen ones.

On to today’s Digest; we’ll be discussing the WHO’s announcement and:

Flutterwave’s wave of announcements

Google’s Privacy Sandbox getting extended to Android

An ambitious wave of products















Following its $250 million Series D announcement on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, African fintech startup Flutterwave has revealed several new products and features.

On Friday, February 18, 2022, it revealed this at its virtual event, Flutterwave 3.0. It also announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard.

One of the products is its Fintech as a Service (FaaS) — enabling businesses to automatically embed financial services into their product. It also introduced Flutterwave Capital which would provide loans for its merchants.

Other products and services include card issuance — physical for Nigerian residents and virtual for others — and Flutterwave Grow to help businesses incorporate across Africa.

Flutterwave-acquired Disha was not left out, with creatives now able to receive payments via their links.

This seems quite ambitious, but it does spell some exciting times in the African fintech ecosystem.

Balancing privacy and profit

Last year, in April, Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy which meant app developers had to explicitly seek the consent of users to use the company’s Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA). In other words, users permission must be sought before their data can be tracked.

There were mixed reactions to this. According to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority’s Mobile ecosystems market study interim report published in December 2021, Apple said organisations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and makers of Firefox, a free and open-source browser, Mozilla supported this decision.

Other parties projected that it would cause a fall in revenue for companies reliant on IDFA to measure and attribute for iOS mobile advertising campaigns. Basically, companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, Snapchat, and Twitter that need advertising revenue were more likely to be affected.

There was also a likelihood that small businesses that rely on these platforms for advertising would be affected as well.

In February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for “small businesses everywhere.” Financial Times revealed that Meta, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube lost $10 billion in revenue once Twitter implemented the ATT more than seven months later.

On Wednesday, February 16, 2022, Google announced that it would be toeing Apple’s line and introducing privacy limitations to cover apps on its Android smartphones, extending its previous decision to do the same on its Chrome browser.

In its blog post, Google said, “Today, we’re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions. Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID.”

While there is no clear-cut explanation of how this would work yet, the company said it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to “improve user privacy without putting access to free content and services at risk.”

It would be interesting to see how this works considering the competing interests of privacy and profit-making. You can also watch out for a Privacy Roundtable explainer this Thursday.

Africa-produced mRNA vaccines















We’ve all probably heard a lot more about vaccines in the last couple of years than we thought we would in our lifetime. But the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has broadened our knowledge. Currently, two of the world’s most effective COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.

There’s a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but an mRNA is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene. mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein — or even just a piece of a protein — that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.

On Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. They are Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia.

This comes after the work being done by the WHO to establish a global technology transfer hub in South Africa to serve low and middle-income countries. Africa suffers from a shortage of biotech facilities, and while health tech is slowly gaining momentum, much of the focus still remains on access to primary healthcare and insurance.

Projects in Nigeria gulp trillions with little results,"In November 2018, Nigeria awarded a $500 million contract to the Sierra Nevada Corporation to manufacture 12 A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft planes for the Nigerian Air Force.

Exactly a year earlier, in 2017, Brazilian aviation giant Embraer announced that it had received a firm order from the Philippine Air Force for six A-29 Super Tucano close air support (CAS) aircraft. IHS Jane, the world’s leading source of defence intelligence, reported that the Philippines’ A-29 contract was valued at $99 million.

The Philippines contract equates to $16.5 million per Tucano aircraft whereas in Nigeria’s case, when other costs included into the contract is taken out, it was $30 million for each one of the 12 that would finally arrive last year.

Why Nigeria paid about double the amount the Philippines paid for the same specification of Tucano jets will leave many scratching their heads, but for Nigerians inflated government expenditure is nothing new.

For years now, at the Nigerian Air Force bases in Makurdi, Kainji and Lagos, unrepaired combat and transport planes bought in the 1970s and 1980s including the French built Alpha Jets, the Anglo-British Jaguar strike aircrafts and the medium-lift C-130 transport planes lie idle and wasting, unmaintained and unused by the Air Force. Nigeria’s biggest ship and only Frigate NNS ARADU has for over a decade been inactive, idle and wasted, unrepaired by the Navy.

‘Beegeagle’, Nigeria’s leading defence analyst noted in 2012 about the Nigerian Air Force Jaguar aircrafts, “The Jaguar jet has had the shortest service life in the Nigerian Air Force, thanks in no small part to the nature of the purchase contract and the international politics of arms transfer at that time. An initial batch of 12 single seat variants were supplied and later six twin-seat versions which were used for pilot training in the United States were inducted into the NAF.

“Sometime in 2007 when these jets were put on display by the NAF for prospective buyers to inspect, it emerged that a Jaguar B TRAINER variant (NAF 703) had flown for only 150 hours 54 minutes since it was manufactured in December 1984. It had its 100 hours’ inspection on the 10th day of February, 1986. It suggests that the created fleet of Jaguar jets is almost brand-new still”.

Simply put, for more than three decades, military aircrafts as well as other assets and platforms bought with tax payers’ money have been wasting away in the open, buffeted by the vagaries of the environment, simply because the military and the government have no interest in repairing them. They are more interested in buying new systems.

Waste, driven by corruption, pervades Nigeria’s defence sector. Transparency International (TI) in a report warned, “Corruption had an undeniable impact on Nigeria’s security situation. Corruption in the defence sector, in particular, has resulted in the waste of billions of dollars’ worth of public funds”.

Corruption and corrupt practices, Kwopnan Bulus, a lecturer in the Department of Political Science at the University of Jos, posits, are the essential problems with poor infrastructure execution, maintenance and procurement in Nigeria.

According to Bulus, “in most cases and as we have seen, kickbacks to politicians and bureaucrats have become so entrenched that it results in poor quality of infrastructure. In addition, a lot of these loans were diverted and used for purposes other than what they were initially procured for. Once this is done, the result is that such infrastructure would unlikely yield the objective result.

“So what the Chinese are doing now,” he added, “is that instead of giving the money to Nigerians, they give the contracts to Chinese companies and pay them, thus eliminating the corruption that is so inherent in the Nigerian system. I think that’s what they are doing with respect to the Akwanga-Makurdi road. We need to be more deliberate about the monitoring and evaluation of the execution and outcomes of the infrastructure projects we are undertaking.”

It is not just about corruption though. It is also the bigger issue of the culture of maintenance that has resulted in poor value for Nigerians for money spent by the government, says Rajneesh Narula, the John H. Dunning chair of International Business Regulation at the Henley Business School, University of Reading. “Many Nigerian politicians,” he notes, “historically tend to want the latest model, rather than spending money on training and undertaking regular maintenance and repairs.”

And it is not just the putrid defence sector alone. Nigeria’s power generation has an installed capacity of about 12,522mw, mostly built from loans garnered in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, actual generated power hovers between a scandalous 3000mw and an immoral 4500mw. The historic gap between the demand for power in Nigeria and the electricity available from the grid has led to widespread self-generation of power in the commercial, industrial and residential sectors; many individuals and businesses own their generators to compensate for lack of access to and supply of energy.

Businesses’ reliance on self-generation via diesel-powered generators has resulted in continuous increase in the price of goods and services. This is because, typically, self-generation accounts for a significant portion of most businesses’ recurrent expenditure; such significant overhead costs are clearly being passed onto consumers.

The World Bank in 2021 noted that 85 million Nigerians do not have access to grid electricity. This represents 43 percent of the country’s population and makes Nigeria the country with the largest energy access deficit in the world. “The lack of reliable power,” said the bank, “is a significant constraint for citizens and businesses, resulting in annual economic losses estimated at $26.2 billion (₦10.1trn) which is equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP.

“According to the 2020 World Bank Doing Business report, Nigeria ranks 171 out of 190 countries in getting electricity and electricity access is seen as one of the major constraints for the private sector.”

Yet, tens of billions of dollars have been spent between 1999 and 2021 to generate microscopic amounts of power. The Federal Government has reportedly spent around $31.45 billion on the sector between 1999 and 2013.

According to dataphyte, in 2021, “almost six years into the Buhari-led government, over ₦1.3 trillion has entered into the electricity sector,” in the form of budgetary provisions and support.

In 2019, the World Bank approved a $550 million loan for Nigeria to develop mini grids and solar home systems. In June 2020, the government approved $120 million for the continued construction and completion of the Kashimbila multipurpose dam in Taraba State, expected to generate 40mw and water for the community. The government recently signed a six-year, N1.15 trillion contract with Germany’s Siemen AG for a three-phased electrification project aimed at increasing Nigeria’s power to 25,000mw.

In March 2021, Nigeria’s government announced that it intended to spend $3 billion on the energy sector in the next 24 months to increase the power being wheeled by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) from the current 4,900mw to at least 7,000mw.

In the transport sector, $5 billion worth of rail projects were flagged off in 2021 with a promise by the government to spend tens of billions of dollars on its rail networks in the coming years. After borrowing over $5 billion from the Chinese to build new rail tracks and buy new locomotives, the country is seeking a further $14.4 billion from outside China to fund an upgrade of a narrow-gauge track in the South-East and the building of a standard-gauge on the coast.

In 2017, Nigeria’s government secured a $6.1 billion loan from China Exim Bank for the construction of Calabar-Port Harcourt, Lagos-Ibadan, Lagos-Kano rail, and Lagos to Kaduna railway and another $1.5 billion counterpart funding for the Lagos-Ibadan project. The administration has accumulated various other loans to fund the projects, which form part of the N40.08 trillion-sovereign-debt burden that is currently weighing heavily on the country’s fiscal position.

In spite of the huge investments made in the rail sector since 2006, the impact of rail on the economy is still meagre. It has done little to reinvigorate the economy, “because the focus is on passengers, the majority of whom who see the ticket prices as too expensive rather than on the movement of goods where much of the income for rail transport globally comes from,” said a Chinese civil engineer involved in the construction of the country’s rail projects.

For Professor Narula, the focus should be on maintenance. “Somewhere in the 1970s,” he notes, “the Dutch ran the railways. In the 1980s, the Indian Railways sent thousands of workers to Nigeria and Nigerians to India to train them in running the railways efficiently and maintaining existing rolling stock, but then after the Indians left, it returned back to the original state of disrepair and inefficiency. Now we have spent a fortune buying trains again, but will they be maintained once the Chinese stop managing it?”

Value for money is not a completely Nigerian problem, argues Andrew Nevin, partner, Financial Services Lead and chief economist at PwC Nigeria. For Nevin, who has lived in Nigeria since 2008, “people all over the world complain of waste. The concept of value for money is new”. In the past, he further notes, “governments did whatever they liked and citizens couldn’t do much. Now this is changing, governments are asking for taxes and levies from citizens and citizens are asking for improvement in the provision of public goods such as education, health, water and electricity. Therefore, there needs to be clear signs that the government can deliver on projects.”

A major challenge he posits, “is the multiplicity of MDAs in Nigeria.” Most of these agencies, he argues, “were never created to deliver value. They were created for patronage during the oil boom days. Due to the many actors involved, and elongated decision-making process, they drive up the cost of value creation and drive down efficiency.”

Nigerians, he urges, should keep putting pressure on governments in a constructive way. “Citizens’ action is no doubt having an effect on the government. We can see that with the programme and project deliveries of the governors of Lagos, Edo, Kaduna and now the election of a brilliant economist and highly competent manager in Anambra, Professor Charles Soludo. People should make their voices heard and choose the right leaders.”","In November 2018, Nigeria awarded a $500 million contract to the Sierra Nevada Corporation to manufacture 12 A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft planes for the Nigerian Air Force.

Nigeria’s decrepit refineries turn money guzzlers,"In the face of poor performance and huge overheads, fixing Nigeria’s unprofitable refineries to functional capacity has remained the promise of every administration since 1999.

Abuja has however piled up debt rather than embrace global examples on how to run a successful refinery, failing to curb an appetite for waste that has eaten the country’s national budget for decades.

Nigeria’s long history of wasteful spending on turnaround maintenance has continued with the present government, as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) spent close to N2 trillion on maintaining its struggling refineries from 2015 till 2021, a development that had not brought Nigeria any closer to ending imports of refined petroleum products.

“Inefficiency is the gift of the present administration, except that sometimes, this gift is in oversupply. Or how else can anyone explain all the expenses on the refineries without any due diligence or risk evaluation,” a source familiar with the matter told BusinessDay.

“It would take more than another repair to cover the developing scandal that Nigeria’s refineries have become,” he said.

A detailed breakdown shows Nigeria’s four public refineries have been a drain on the finances of Africa’s biggest economy, as NNPC data showed Nigeria spent N82.82 billion on maintenance in 2015.

Even though the spending has been futile, the wasteful pattern continued in the remaining three years of President Buhari’s first reign as the state-run energy company, NNPC, spent N78.95 billion, N604.127 billion and N426.66 billion in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, on the refineries.

In 2019, NNPC records showed the amount expended on the refineries dropped to N218.18 billion. The NNPC also declared that N64.534 billion was spent on the three refining companies from January to June 2020.

The NNPC spent N100 billion on the rehabilitation of the nation’s refineries in 2021.

In its latest presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting seen by BusinessDay, NNPC said it spent N100 billion on the rehabilitation of the nation’s refineries in 2021.

According to the state oil firm, the fund was used to revamp the facilities throughout the year.

Although the specific refineries were not stated, according to the funding report, NNPC said it spent N8.3 billion every month in 2021 to revamp the refineries.

The situation in Nigeria has become even more worrisome after the first-ever audited report of NNPC showed that Nigeria’s four refineries gulped a combined loss of N154.54 billion in 2018 compared to N252 billion in 2017.

According to advocates of fixing the refineries, the government’s main argument is that if the refineries are sold in their current state, they’ll be flogged for less than their scrap value.

“Refineries are one of the most complex facilities to run, they are capital, technology and management intensive operations, yet low margin,” Olagoke Balogun, former processor operator at Chevron with 13 years experience in the refining business, said.

Balogun noted, “Aside from corruption, the Nigerian state is grossly incompetent to run such complex operations even if they wanted to.”

In a world where global private refiners with stronger and more efficient systems are struggling to break even, most experts are in awe of President Buhari’s decision to shell out $1.5-billion to flog the dying Port Harcourt refinery horse, before, according to the new plan, handing them over to private companies to manage

While Nigeria’s economic managers seemed obsessed with maintaining its refineries; Petrobras, Brazil’s equivalent of the NNPC, decided that the smart thing to do was to sell off the refinery’s assets and cut its loss.

In a competitive global bid, Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment fund offered to buy Petrobras’s 333,000bpd Landulpho Alves refinery for $1.8billion, a value higher than what the Nigerian government intends to invest in a rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery guaranteed to produce a worse outcome.

According to some reports, the company could realise about $25billion-$35billion from the sale of its non-core assets in the next four years.

“Which means, by re-evaluating its assets, Brazil could get in four years what Nigeria used in 30 to fix its own rickety assets,” Joe Nwakwue, a former chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), said.

While the development in Brazil serves as a lesson for how Nigeria efficiently manages its refineries, the echoes from Zambia serves as warning.

At their peak, Zambia’s copper mines produced 12 percent of the world’s copper. They were the pride of Zambia and the glory of southern Africa.

However, a combination of steep crashes in commodity prices, global politics, internal incompetence and mismanagement, some of which are present in today’s Nigerian refineries put the future of the mines in grave danger.

In response to the economic crisis facing Zambia in the 90’s, President Frederick Chiluba was offered $165million by foregin investors to buy Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), the country’s largest mining facility.

President Chiluba haggled for nine years. When the price of copper finally collapsed in 2000, the best he could get for KCM was $90 million.","In the face of poor performance and huge overheads, fixing Nigeria’s unprofitable refineries to functional capacity has remained the promise of every administration since 1999.

"MTN, Airtel make N2.02tn from airtime, data in 2021","Nigeria’s leading Telecom companies, MTN Nigeria and Airtel Nigeria both made in N2.02tn from airtime and data revenues in 2021.

The figures which were contained in the financial statements of the two companies indicates a 20.01 per cent increase from the N1.68tn both companies made from airtime and data revenues in 2020.

The amount 9mobile and Globacom made from data and airtime revenues could not be obtained as their financial statements are not made public.

According to statistics from the Nigerian Communications Commission, MTN and Airtel are the two major call carriers in the nation. In its industry statistics report for 2020, a total 150,825,830,687.40 minutes of calls were made.

Of this number, a total of 145,420,101,695 calls (96.42 per cent) were made from MTN lines (103,531,547,686 minutes), while the remaining (41,888,554,009 minutes) were made on Airtel network.

In 2021, MTN made N819.74bn and N516.21bn from airtime and data, respectively; in 2020, it made N766.39bn and N332.37bn from airtime and data, respectively. In 2021, Airtel made N397.91bn ($957m) and N287.31bn ($691m) from airtime and data, respectively; in 2020, it made N370.47bn ($891m) and N214.96bn ($517m) from airtime and data, respectively.

In its financial statement for the year end, December 2021, MTN said its data revenue had continued to maintain an upward trajectory even as it expanded its 4G coverage. It added that average megabyte per subscriber rose by 85.3 per cent in the year.

“Data revenue rose by 55.3 per cent, maintaining an accelerated growth trajectory in Q4 as we continue to accelerate the expansion of our 4G coverage, enhance the quality and capacity of our network to support increasing data traffic, and grow active data users,” it said.

“Average MB per user rose by 62.7 per cent, enabling overall data traffic growth of 85.3 per cent. Also, smartphone penetration on the network grew by 4.0pp to 50 per cent. Our 4G network now covers 70.3 per cent of the population, up from 60.1 per cent in December 2020.”

MTN added that its voice revenue grew by 8.4 per cent more than that of 2020 as a result of higher usage in its active SIM base, as it witnessed a 7.9 per cent growth in minutes of use.

According to Airtel, its voice revenue grew by 8.4 per cent, resulting in a 7.9 per cent growth in minutes of use.

The Chief Executive Officer, Airtel Africa Plc, Segun Ogunsanya, said, “Voice revenues posted year on year growth of 9.9 per cent, almost 10 per cent in the quarter, a slight slowdown given the softer quarter particularly in Q1 but still reflecting year on year customer growth of 5.8 per cent, adding voice ARPU growth of 5.2 per cent.

“We still fundamentally believe that with the low customer penetration levels across our footprint of 14 countries, combined with very low minutes of usage, there is still a very long runway for voice revenues to continue to grow.”

Online lender set to provide salary on demand,"By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU

When the online lenders such as Fairmoney, Quick Check and other online lending application sites came on board a couple of years ago, many Nigerians were happy that finally they could access loans within less than 30 minutes to meet their needs.

Actually the new online lenders came in handy as many Nigerians in need of quick loans are now able to access the loans without much ado, unlike the hassle and possible rejection of their applications and tough requirements demanded of them by conventional commercial banks.

In recent years, the Nigerian fintech space is making wave, blossoming exponentially, and at the same time drawing the attention of both foreign and local investors and drawing new entrants into the diverse sub-sectors within the ecosystem.

A good number of them such as Fairmoney, Renmoney and others have made good offering uncollateralized loan facilities to Nigerians albeit at eye-popping interest rates.

On this point of interest rates, it would look as if some have met and agreed to come down hard on defaulters, resorting to unbelievably desperate measures to recover loan facilities obtained from their apps.

Findings made by Business Hallmark have revealed that a great number of the loan app operators now send embarrassing short messages service (SMS) and WhatsApp messages to the close contacts of their loan defaulters with the intention of shaming the defaulters, tagging them with terms like ‘criminal,’ ‘fraudster,’ and ‘terrible debtor’ among others.

In some cases, the full names, phone numbers and pictures of the alleged loan defaulters are shared with their contacts like religious leaders, members of churches and mosques, close friends, bosses, colleagues and family members.

But the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has described the debt recovery strategy adopted by some of these fintechs as a data-sharing breach.

BusinessHallmark investigations showed that the agency does not support such “ambushed tactic of debt recovery” and emphasized that no fintech firm is allowed to share its customers’ data without due process.

This was made known in a press release last year by NITDA’s spokesperson, Hadiza Umah.

To curb the trend, NITDA imposed a sanction of N10 million on an online lending platform, Soko Lending Company Limited (Sokoloan), for data privacy invasion.

According to NITDA, it received a series of complaints against the company, including ‘unauthorized disclosures, failure to protect customers’ personal data, and defamation of character.

In view of the fact that majority of these online lenders charge high interest rates and expect their loan beneficiaries to pay back within shortest time, some seven days, or 14 days the maximum tenure is one month, many desirous of accessing loans for one reason or the other are now wary of approaching online lenders.

Adegoke Sanmi, a mechanic said “I will not go to them for loan again. I approached one of them last year for a loan of N10,000 to be paid back in seven days. On that date, when I was making frantic efforts to repay the loans, I started receiving calls from people in my contacts that an online lender sent them text messages that I’m a chronic debtor and criminal.”

Many people who have been victims of such crude tactic of debt recovery told this medium that they prefer to join contribution groups instead of these online lenders.

In view of the unwholesome experiences of Nigerians in the hands of online lenders, the arrival of a Nigerian startup, Earnipay, which has raised $4 million to provide on-demand salary to workers would be a refreshing new dawn. But only salaries earners can benefit from the scheme.

Earnipay is a financial technology solution that gives on-demand salary access to income-earners, it announced last Friday it landed a seed deal of l $4 million to scale its operation in Africa.

Making the disclosure was Maria Adediran, Earnipay’s accounts director, in a statement to the media, seen by BusinessHallmark.

Founded in 2021 by Nonso Onwuzulike, Earnipay officially launched operations in January with less fanfare.

At the launch, the Fintech company said its aim is to improve employees’ financial well-being by partnering with employers and seamlessly integrating with their payroll systems to offer its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app on any day of the month.

“At the end of the month, the employer deducts from the employee’s salary the amount withdrawn, refunds Earnipay with it, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for that month,” the firm said.

“Earnipay charges employees a small processing fee of N250 or N500 for this access. There is no payback and no interest charge because employees are accessing what they have worked for, it’s their money,” the statement said.

According to Earnipay, the funding round was led by Canaan, with participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital and Paystack.

According to the company, with the seed funding, Earnipay will accelerate the development of its technology platform to serve large enterprise employers. By doing so, Earnipay will provide employees with the tools they need to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.

The company says it would offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees by the end of 2022.

Speaking on the funding round, the CEO Nonso Onwuzulike, said “Financial worries are the leading cause of distractions in the workplace. The monthly pay cycle means employees are often unable to afford daily expenses, cover emergencies or take advantage of immediate financial opportunities.

“As a result, they become exposed to predatory payday loans and get stuck in unending debt cycles with unrealistic payback periods and expensive interest rates.

“Earnipay exists to address this problem and offer an ethical alternative to instant salary access while helping employers improve employee engagement and retention at zero cost to their business.

“The future of salary is on-demand, and we’re excited to be pioneering this amazing solution in Africa. I’m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected investors who understand the need for a platform such as Earnipay to drive better access to salaries, and, importantly, to improve the financial well-being of income-earners in Africa,” Mr. Onwuzulike said.

Controversy trails Nigeria’s 3.4% GDP growth – The growth is questionable —Experts,"BY EMEKA EJERE

The report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which put Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2021 at 3.4 percent, has sparked controversy, with economists arguing that the said growth could be linked to the base effects of the recession witnessed in 2020.

The GDP report released on Thursday also showed that the economy weakened further in the fourth quarter of 2021, after recording a decline in the third quarter of last year.

Specifically, the report revealed that the quarterly GDP growth fell to 3.98 per cent in Q4 2021, from the 4.03 per cent and 5.01 per cent recorded in Q3 and Q2, respectively.

The annual growth rate of 3.4 per cent is the highest the country has recorded in seven years. The last time the country’s annual GDP growth rate exceeded three per cent was in 2014, when a 6.22 per cent growth was recorded.

In 2015, annual GDP stood at 2.7 per cent; it contracted to -1.58 per cent in 2016; rebounded slightly to 0.8 per cent in 2017; grew to 1.91 per cent in 2018 and 2.27 per cent in 2019. Due to the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, the country’s annual with GDP again contracted to -1.92 per cent 2020.

The World Bank had in the latest edition of its Nigeria Development Update in November raised its 2021 and 2022 economic growth forecasts for Nigeria to 2.7 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively, saying the economy had experienced a rebound that was faster than expected. In the June 2021 edition of the NDU, the Bretton Wood institution projected a growth rate of 1.8 per cent in 2021 and 2.1 per cent in 2022.

Earlier in April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had in the reviewed 2021 World Economic Outlook raised Nigeria’s 2021 growth projection to 2.5 per cent, a figure 1.5 percent point higher than January’s estimate and much higher than the 0.8 per cent forecast in October 2020.

The latest NBS report read in part, “Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.98 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the fourth quarter of 2021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 per cent and -3.62 per cent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 per cent in 2021.

“The Q4 2021 growth rate was higher than the 0.11 per cent growth rate recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87 per cent points and lower than 4.03 per cent recorded in Q3 2021 by 0.05 per cent points.

‘Questionable growth’

Speaking with Business Hallmark, Prof Leo Ukpong of the Department of Economics, University of Uyo, described the growth figure released by the NBS as questionable.

“Well, if the figures are true, it is a good thing, considering that the economy is still recovering from the shocks of Covid-19 and oil price crash.

“However, when you look at the level of unemployment, rate of inflation among other issues, you begin to wonder where the growth is coming from.”

Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Centre for The Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, in an interview with Business Hallmark, noted that the recent GDP numbers are indicative of a gradual recovery of the economy.

He observed that that the full year GDP growth of 3.4% and the fourth quarter GDP growth of 3.98%, surpassed both IMF and World Bank projections of 2.6% and 2.7% respectively.

According to him, the positive growth outcomes were driven by a strong base effect and the easing of shocks of the pandemic on the economy.

He said: “The base year (2020) was characterized by devastating shocks of the Covid 19 pandemic. There was a collapse of commodity prices, supply chains were disrupted, travels were restricted and many sectors were on complete lockdown.

“But in 2021, we saw a rebound of oil prices, relaxation of travel restrictions, improvements in vaccination rates, lifting of lockdowns and economic stimulus programmes by government.

“The fourth quarter typically witnessed increased spending and heightened tempo of economic activities because of the end of year festivities. These were the critical drivers of the growth.

“However, GDP growth is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. For growth to be meaningful, it must impact on citizens welfare, create jobs, alleviate poverty, reduce inequality, ensure prosperity of small businesses and promote inclusion.

“Economic performance on the score of these metrics has been suboptimal. Galloping inflation and the sharp depreciation of the currency had inflicted immeasurable shocks on business performance and the welfare of citizens. Citizens’ purchasing power was considerably eroded thus aggravating poverty.

“While we welcome the positive growth numbers, we reckon that there is still a great deal of work to be done to translate the growth to improved welfare and prosperity of small businesses. This would require a mix of fiscal, monetary and social policy interventions.”

In a similar view, the Executive Vice Chairman, HighCap Securities, Mr. David Adonri, observed that the figures surpassed projections by both analysts and international organisations like the World Bank and IMF.

He, however, argued that the growth figures as released by the NBS may simply be as a result of base effect, since it is coming just after a year of terrible economic inactivity.

“However, you know that 2020 was so bad with the pandemic, high unemployment, high inflation and crashed oil prices”, Adonri said.

“So, the growth they’re talking about is mainly as a result of what we call base effect. What that means is that since 2020 was so bad and down, anything recorded subsequently will be so magnified. So, that growth doesn’t mean much to me.”

Meanwhile, the federal government and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have exchanged verbal blows over the report. In an interview with a national daily on Thursday, National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Debo Ologunagba, said Nigeria’s economy could not have witnessed growth because of the voodoo economics being implemented by President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government.

The PDP spokesman, who wondered how Nigeria could have witnessed economic growth with the high level of insecurity and unemployment, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) was running a government of liars, by liars and for liars.

He said, “This is the voodoo economics of Buhari. When you talk of economic growth it must have a direct impact on the lives of the people. If it is growth, it cannot grow downwards, growth goes upwards. We all know the economy of Nigeria has been going dow.”.

“They say there was economic growth in the last quarter of last year when there were massive killings in the North-West? Growth has to do with production and human development index. So, what is the basis of this growth? We don’t have the right statistics.”

Ologungba said the NBS could have been deceived at the point of the collation of data which is usually provided by the federal government.

Responding to the PDO, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said it was unfortunate that the opposition party was sad over Nigeria’s progress.

The minister stated, “A vibrant opposition is important in any democracy. However, we have an opposition that doesn’t want to hear anything good about the country and this administration. It is the same NBS that reported that the country was in recession. At that time, it was not fake or cooked.

“So, I think we should learn to believe in the country, we should understand that while opposition is very good for a vibrant democracy, a nihilistic opposition that sees nothing good in the administration should be condemned.”

On why many Nigerians were not yet feeling the impact of economic growth, Mohammed said economic recovery is a slow process like a human being getting cured of an ailment, adding that more Nigerians will feel the impact of the government’s policy in due course.

BREAKING: Court Strikes Out Suit Seeking To Disqualify Atiku From 2023 Contest,"A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Monday, struck out a suit seeking the disqualification of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, from contesting the 2023 presidential election.

The suit, marked FHC/ABJ/CS/177, challenged Atiku’s eligibility on the premise that he is not a Nigerian by birth.

Recall that the subject of Atiku’s citizenship came shortly after the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, claimed that the former VP was ‘Cameroonian’ in the build-up to the 2019 elections.

Subsequently, a group under the aegis of the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa (EMN) in the suit, urged the court to determine; “Whether section 25 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), is the sole authority that spells out ways by which a person can become a Nigerian citizen by birth?”

“Whether by the provisions of section 131(a) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), only a Nigeria citizen by birth can contest for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria?”

The group also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Attorney-general of the Federation as respondents in the case.

The Adamawa State government, through its Attorney-General (AG), had on July 27, 2021, sought an order of the court to be joined in the suit. The state government told the court that Atiku was eligible to vie for the office of the president.

Delivering judgement on the case, Justice Inyang Ekwo struck out the suit for want of merit.

JUST-IN: ISWAP Terrorists Overrun Military Base In Borno,"Members of Boko Haram Terrorists splinter group, Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), on Sunday night, overran a military base located at Gamboru-Ngala in Borno State.

The terrorists according to sources attacked the military base in Gamboru Central Primary School and dislodged personnel of the Nigerian Army (NA).

The terrorists burnt down the security facility in a reprisal attack following military onslaughts in the Lake Chad region.

The devastating offensives of Nigerian troops led to the killing of many terrorist commanders and fighters in Lake Chad Basin (LCB) and Sambisa forest.

Just last week, Nigerian Military airstrikes eliminated Amir Buba Danfulani and four other notorious ISWAP commanders in Tumbuns and Sambisa axis.

Danfulani was a senior ISWAP Commander saddled with indoctrinating Fulanis and herdsmen in joining a terrorist group. He also coordinated activities of the terrorists ranging from the deployment of spies as well as tax collectors.

It was gathered that the terrorists got upset, and targeted the military base. They were said to have fired explosives into Ngala town at the weekend which also resulted to the killing of one civilian while six persons were injured.

When contacted, the Director of Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, said he was not aware of such developments but promised to find out and get back to our reporter.

At the parley with the theme: ”Mobilising Citizens as a Social Capital Towards 2023 General Elections,” the lawmakers emphasized the need for collaboration between the two arms of government for seamless governance.

Obasa said there should be adequate voter education to avoid voter apathy, violence and cases of void votes during the exercise.

He added that the fact that Nigeria is preparing for the 2023 elections means that democracy has become entrenched in the country.

On his part, Yishawu said, “The purpose of the parley is not just bonding between legislature and executive, it is more about sharing ideas on how to better the lots of the people. Most of the policies and direction in Lagos today are being propelled from this kind of interaction. So it (parley) is very important to governance and I’m happy it has been sustained. I give kudos to the people who started it and the people that have sustained it.”

Speaking on the 2023 presidential election, Yishawu stated, “For me and I know a lot of people believe that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the only candidate to beat come 2023. This is somebody that has distinguished himself, his records and pedigree speak for him.

“But in politics you don’t just sit back and say I know who I am. This is a leader that is able to see the unseen and foresee the unknown. So we need those qualities to be able to take us from where we are today and take us to where we ought to be.”

Sanwo-Olu’s Wife Decries Lack Of Attention For Boy Child,"Wife of Lagos State governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has decried lack of attention for the boy child in the country, saying it is high time people paid closer attention to issues affecting the boy-child.

The governor’s wife, who spoke at an inaugural three-day residential workshop for about 160 boys selected from secondary schools, special correctional centres, and orphanage homes across the state, stressed the need to pay closer attention to the issues affecting the boy-child.

The workshop, with the theme: “The 21st Century Boy Child: Creating a Vision for Transformation,” is an essential component of the novel Boy Child Initiative of the Office of the Lagos First Lady designed to bring issues affecting boys to the front burner and proffer workable solutions.

She said the objectives of the initiative are to raise awareness on the rights and welfare of the boy child, promote educational opportunities to male children, especially the indigent, facilitate the rehabilitation of the vulnerable boy child through referrals, and build a new generation of transformed male children who will contribute positively to the society.

“The idea is that we want to catch our boys young and make them be part of the solutions and not add to the challenges confronting our nation.

“Also, by the nature and perception of the Boy Child as being strong and resilient, it has been observed that society tends to pay little or no attention to issues affecting male children.

“There is a lot happening out there. We have children committing suicide; we have youths involved in all sorts of social vices and so on. This is why we have decided to put issues of the boy child on the front burner with this initiative,” the First Lady said.

As part of the workshop, participants were taken on a tour of the Lagos State Agricultural Training Institute, Araga in Epe to stimulate their interest in farming and agricultural value chains which are critical to guarantee food security, while they thereafter proceeded to the Lagos State Model College, Badore, Ajah for the residential training which was facilitated by seasoned subject-matter experts.

According to union sources, NEC members will meet with Federal Government officials later this week after the conference.

After a two-day meeting at the University of Lagos, Akoka, ASUU declared a nationwide four-week roll-over strike last week Monday.

Despite meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, on October 14, 2021, on issues such as funding for revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution; promotion arrears, renegotiation of the 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement, and inconsistencies in Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System Payment, the union said it had no choice but to go on strike.

According to investigations, several members of the ASUU NEC had arrived in Abuja on Sunday afternoon in preparation for the meeting.

Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, the national chairman of ASUU, told our correspondent that if the government was responsive, there would be no need for the strike to persist for weeks.

“It is just a meeting; they are inviting us for a meeting within the week. They will tell us why they called. I don’t know what they plan to tell us, we will meet them within the week,” he said.

He told Nigerians to “Appeal to the government to implement the agreement we signed with them. The strike can be called off any day, it is in the government’s hand if they want it to last for a week, two weeks, one month, a year, or more. It is the government that will decide when they want the strike to end. Our position is that they should agree and implement what they signed with us. If they are responsive, it doesn’t need to last for weeks. We have given them one month to react.”

Also, the ASUU Chairman, Federal University, Dutsin-ma, Dr Jibrin Shagari, in an interview with The PUNCH, confirmed that the union’s NEC members will converge on Abuja on Monday night.

Shagari said, “Yes, I can confirm that our national officers will be in Abuja on Monday night where they will meet and later meet the Federal Government.”

ASUU rules out confidence in FG as meeting holds

Meanwhile, union members still do not believe that the government is ready to meet their demands.

The Chairman, ASUU, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Dr Gbenga Adeleye, insisted that the union would not call off the strike if their demands were not met.

He said, “We are on strike. If they don’t do what they are supposed to do, we are not going to call off the strike.

“There is nothing about whether we are confident or not confident.

“It is for them to meet our demands, if they are not meeting our demands, we are not calling off the strike.”

Similarly, the Chairman of ASUU at the University of Ibadan, Prof. Ayo Akinwole, in a statement on Sunday, said, so far, those in charge of the Ministry of Education had displayed gross incompetence and lack the interests of the masses.

Akinwole described the FG as a slave merchant, who only listened and implemented he destructive policy recommendations of the International Monetary fund and World Bank against the larger interest of Nigerians.

He said, “The Federal Government lacks integrity. It is sad. The government cannot be trusted any longer. We have been on the same salary for 13 years and it is even shameful to show anyone your payslip.

“When compared to the work we do, we have sacrificed for Nigeria to the detriment of our wellbeing and this is already dampening the morale of our people.

“Federal Government should sign the renegotiated agreement, implement it, roll out UTAS, pay unpaid earned academic allowances, commit more funds into the revitalisation of universities.

“Parents should impress it on the government to sign the new welfare package for our members. If we fail to fight for our rights, the slave merchants in government will continue to trade with our future and future of the children of the masses.”","According to union sources, NEC members will meet with Federal Government officials later this week after the conference.

Breaking: Court throws out suit challenging Atiku’s citizenship,"A Federal High Court in Abuja Monday struck out a suit challenging the Nigerian citizenship of former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.

Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo struck out the suit instituted by the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa challenging the Nigerian citizenship of former number two man in Nigeria.

The court held that the Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) had no legal right in the first instance to query the citizenship of the former Vice President.

Justice Ekwo said the NGO having been registered under Company and Allied Matters Act with special functions cannot jump into public interest litigation that was not part of the objective.

He cautioned the NGO to refrain from filing frivolous applications targeted at harrassing politically exposed Nigerians.

In addition, Justice Ekwo held that the plaintiff lacks the locus standi to institute the legal action, describing them as “busy body and middlesome interlopers.”

In the suit, the group had asked the court to disqualify Atiku as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and to restrain him from contesting the February 16, 2019 presidential election over alleged circumstances surrounding his citizenship.

The suit which was filed on 11th February, 2019, has Atiku, PDP, the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice as well as the Attorney General of Adamawa state as defendants.

Specifically, the plaintiff had approached the court for an interpretation of Sections 25(1) & (2) and 131(a) of the 1999 Constitution.

By the suit, the plaintiff prayed for “A declaration that by the combined interpretation of Sections 25(l) & (2) and 131(a) of the Constitution and given the circumstances surrounding Atiku’s birth, he cannot be cleared by PDP and INEC to contest for post of president.”","A Federal High Court in Abuja Monday struck out a suit challenging the Nigerian citizenship of former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.

Bad fuel: Tension as probe panel uncovers 3rd party involvement,"There is palpable fear and tension in the oil and gas sector as security agencies commenced investigation into the importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol into the country.

This is not unconnected with the findings of the investigation by security agencies, a source conversant with the probe told Blueprint in Abuja weekend.

The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited had admitted that four PMS cargoes imported by four consortia under the Direct Sale of Crude Oil and Direct Purchase of Petroleum (DSDP) programme were adulterated.

The importers are; MRS which imported through vessel MT Bow Pioneer and loaded at Litasco Terminal; Antwerp-Belgium, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, which used vessel MT Tom Hilde and loaded from the same terminal; Oando loaded through MT Elka Apollon from the same terminal; as well as NNPC’s subsidiary, Duke Oil, which used MT Nord Gainer and also loaded the vessel from the same terminal.

Blueprint learnt that a loophole in the system was exploited to get the cargoes identified to contain dangerous levels of methanol, used to blend PMS into the country.

The discovery of the contaminated petroleum product, which has cost the country several billions in losses, has seen acute fuel shortages and long queues in Abuja, Lagos and most parts of the country.

Over the past few weeks, the NNPC and its subsidiaries have been running helter-skelter to mop up the dirty petrol as well as restock filling stations.

Across the country, some motorists have complained of damages to their cars with civil society organisations threatening protests against the NNPC leadership as well as the affected companies.

Buhari’s order

In response to public outcry over what some in security circles have described as economic sabotage, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered that producers and providers of the bad product be held accountable and nobody should be spared.

A press statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, reads in part: “In a reaction to the issue of petroleum product shortages linked to the inadvertent supply of products of foreign origin into the Nigerian market, President Buhari said the protection of consumer interests is a priority of the present administration and is ready to take all necessary measures to protect consumers from hazardous products, loss or injuries from the consumption of substandard goods.

“The President directed that in line with the law, service providers must make full disclosure of relevant information with respect to consumption of their products and that dissatisfied consumers are entitled to a proper redress of their complaints.”

Security checks

Blueprint reports that in line with the presidential directive, security agencies had since commenced investigation into the circumstances and are expected to make their findings known within a two-week timeframe.

According to a source in one of the security agencies who asked not to be named as he was not permitted to speak, “findings of the probe indicate that heads would roll. The order by the president is clear. He said it should be investigated and that has put all security agencies on their toes.

“The agencies are on top of the matter and investigation has been up and all involved parties, individuals and corporate companies were invited and they made useful revelations. They have answered questions and provided information on what may have gone wrong.

“The major players have been told they can be invited over and over as fresh facts emerge in the course of the investigation. Not too long from now, Nigerians will see decisive action on this embarrassing situation.”

On which agencies are involved in the investigation and which was leading the investigation, the source said: “The investigation falls directly within the mandate, role and functions of the Department of State Services (DSS).

“They are saddled with the responsibility of, among others, prevention, detection of economic crimes of national security dimension; as well as provision of timely advice on all matters of national security interest.”

However, a source in the NNPC disclosed to Blueprint that the management of the corporation, which actually raised the alarm of the contaminated PMS, was in support of the investigation as their own findings uncovered the involvement of third parties.

According to the official, who asked not to be named, the probe was getting complicated and technical, especially with the establishment of third party involvement in the supply of the bad products.

According to the source, a particular company (name withheld) that has been trying to absolve itself of blame was found to have got its supply from BP, which was discovered to have got its supply from other sources as well.

This, the source said, had created room for blame trading.

In a bid to forestall any legal complications from the outcome of the probe, the source said technical assistance had been provided for the investigating agencies.

The source further disclosed that invitation and interrogation of some companies with DCDP was being delayed to avoid disruption of supply of products as the NNPC was committed to ensuring complete disappearance of fuel queues.

CSOs express angst

Meanwhile, the Northern Coalition Forum (NCF) has called for the resignation of NNPC Group Managing Director Mele Kyari and CEO Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Engr. Farouk Ahmed over importation of methanol adulterated fuel into Nigeria.

The forum, a coalition of 26 civil society organisations in Northern Nigeria under the aegis of Coalition of Concerned Northern Forum(CCNF), also urged the immediate sack of all NNPC management staff, punitive measure against the importers of the adulterated fuel, and adequate compensations for owners of vehicles, generators and machines damaged by the fuel, which has caused extended fuel scarcity across the country.

In a statement jointly signed by leaders of the groups, Malam Ibrahim Bature and Comrade Abdulsalam Moh’d Kazeem, they said: “We condemn in totality the current persistent scarcity of petroleum products across the nation, the scarcity is aimed at embarrassing the current administration by its enemies and unpatriotic elements from within.

“Since 2015 till date, we have over two GMD’s, to our greatest surprise as progressives all the past GMDs of NNPC including Mr Ibe Kachikwu have helped the current administration greatly, in ensuring that all petroleum products meet our nation’s required standard and also ensured no scarcity and fuel queues in our filling stations even during festive periods.

“The current administration has spent over six years without fuel scarcity and queues in our filling stations, the same administration has less than two years to go, but strangely, fuel scarcity has surfaced due to importation of an adulterated PMS, which has never happened in the history of our country, pointing towards discrediting the record of Mr President and minister of petroleum.

“NNPC’s quality inspection unit which comprises of GMO, SGS, Geochem and G&G did not conduct any test before the said products were discharged, the above units are saddled with the responsibilities of ensuring that the products are not above our required standard, yet the same unit has up till date equipment at her disposal with adequate funding for such tasks.

“NNPC management should make public genuine and comprehensive names of those involved in this national scandal and embarrassment. If our demands are not met in the next three working days, we shall occupy all NNPC zonal offices and its subsidiaries across our region and the FCT. We will follow up with full action after the expiration of our ultimatum and this will serve as litmus test for government’s fight against corruption and indiscipline,” the statement further said.","There is palpable fear and tension in the oil and gas sector as security agencies commenced investigation into the importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol into the country.

"APC National Convention: Uncertainty as party awaits Buhari on Al-Makura, Mustapha, Musa, Akume","Ahead of the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for Saturday, the serving governors and other major critical stakeholders have narrowed the contest to four leading aspirants from the North-central.

Blueprint also gathered that the names of the four shortlisted aspirants have been forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari to make his choice.

This is coming amid uncertainty surrounding the February 26, 2022 date announced by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).

Investigations revealed in Abuja Sunday that some party stakeholders had perfected plan to sell to Mr President, an idea of holding congresses in the zones where zonal leaders would emerge before the national convention.

An APC chieftain who confided in one of our correspondents said the proponents of such idea believed a strong reason must be advanced to convince the president on why February 26 date for the national convention is not feasible.

The source said: “Remember the party conducted congresses at Ward, Local Government and up to state level. Therefore, the zonal leaders should also emerge before the national convention. It is a logical thing. Again this will reduce the level of acrimony among our members.”

Blueprint had reported that the party was yet to sell the nomination forms to the aspirants, yet to inaugurate all the committees for the national convention and also speak on the zoning formula.

Further to this, the aspirants are yet to be screened by the appropriate committee to be saddled with such responsibility.

Put together, another party source said, “In a matter of days, the Buni committee may have to announce a change in the convention date. This is most probable when one looks at all of these things that are not yet in place.”

Aspirants

The lucky aspirants, though not in particular order include; Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from Niger state, Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa state, Mallam Saliu Mustapha from Kwara state and ex-Governor George Akume from Benue state.

But apart from the quartet, there are about ten others from the North-east and North-west jostling to lead the APC in same capacity.

Al-makura

Similarly, Al-makura is a lawmaker and two-term governor of Nasarawa state. Born in 1952, he was the only Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) governor President Buhari had in his kitty during the merger negotiation that produced the ruling APC in 2014.

In 1980, Al-makura emerged the youth leader of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in the old Plateau state. He was elected into the Constituent Assembly of 1988–89 representing the Lafia–Obi Federal Constituency of what is now Nasarawa state.

The politician was also the state secretary of the National Republican Convention (NRC) in the old Plateau state from 1990 to 1992.

As a close political ally to the president, stakeholders are of the view that he may be considered for the party’s top job.

Musa

The lawmaker currently represents Niger East in the National Assembly. Born in 1965, Musa has been in politics for the better part of his adult years having also come from a family of politicians

As chairman of Activate Technologies Limited between 2011 and 2017, he coordinated the design, planning, production and delivery of Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and Smart Card Readers (SCR) which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) deployed for the 2015 and 2019 general elections.

Musa is also the chairman of the all-important Senate Services Committee and also a member of eight other committees in the upper chamber.

The lawmaker has sponsored about 12 bills including the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill, 2021; FCT Borderline Community Development Commission Bill, 2021 and the Critical Infrastructure Protection Bill, 2021 among others.

Though rumoured to have some governors’ support, it is not however sure if the presidency would be favourably disposed to his candidature.

Mustapha

Mustapha, considered by many as a bridge between the old and the young, is a native of Ilorin, Kwara state. Born in 1972, the Turaki of Ilorin started his political career in the early 21st century when he became the first national publicity secretary of the Progressive Action Congress (PAC), a defunct political party that contested in the 2003 presidential election.

Mustapha became a member of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) during which he was committed to Buhari’s presidential ambition.

In 2009, when a breakaway faction of the ANPP, led by Buhari, formed the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Mustapha became the deputy national chairman of the party. He held this position until the party merged with other amalgams to form the APC.

Considering his wealth of experience in party administration coupled with his loyalty to Buhari since their days in the ANPP till date, the Kwara born politician, it is believed, may ultimately emerge the party leader.

Above all, observers believe, President Buhari’s recent statement that youth be given prominent roles within the party and administration may also work in Mustapha’s favour.

Akume

Akume is a former Benue state governor and current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs.

Born in 1953, Akume became governor in 1999 and served out two terms of four years each.

The former governor later won another election to represent his people in Nigeria’s Senate. He was the Minority Leader of the Senate from June 2011 to June 2015.

He was re-elected Senator for Benue North-west in the April 2011 elections, running on the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) platform, during which he was chairman Senate committee on Army.

In this contest for the position of the national chairmanship, Akume is seen in some quarters as the most experienced with home-based support, reach across the country and the only Christian on the list.

Forum cautions on Al-makura

Meanwhile, the Progressive Disability Forum(PDF), the disability wing of the APC, has warned against using the ‘disability’ condition of Al-makura as a basis to disqualify him from the party’s chairmanship race.

The forum, in a letter signed by its national coordinator, Abdulaziz Onibare and addressed to President Buhari, stated that the party would be in contravention of the National Disability Act and its constitution if such move succeeded.

“It has come to our notice that some groups of people are moving around castigating the person of His Excellency, Senator Umaru Tanko Al makura, questioning his capacity on the basis of his disability. They didn’t question his capacity when he was contributing his millions, time and energy for the progress of the party,” it said.

The group said the lawmaker’s disability should not be a yardstick to measure his competence to lead the party, stating that he had paid his dues as a true party man.

To this end, the forum said, the former governor should be given the opportunity to lead APC to a resounding victory during the 2023 elections, and pleaded that its members’ contribution to the party should not to be allowed to go in vain.

It lamented that the leadership of the party had continued to marginalise the group as it has never held any tangible positions, adding that: “We should be given the opportunity to lead this party, and our disability cannot be counted as a barrier. Hence, we felt it a point of duty to emphasize it.”

Clamour for youth

In a related development, the Coalition For Democracy and Credible Election (CODECE) has urged the party to elect a youth as its next national chairman to reflect Buhari’s words on youths.

This appeal was contained in a letter titled;” Our Utmost Advise(sic) on the Most Suitable Candidate” and signed by the group’s national coordinator, Amb. Mohammed Atta.

“With due honor and respect, we write to convey the mood of the nation to you as the election year draws nearer, and the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s National Convention slated for February 26, 2022 is few days away.”

“It is on good record that your Excellency had in the last six (6) years given more recognition, opportunities and support to the youths of Nigeria more than any leader before you. This much, you recently demonstrated when you directed the office of the Secretary to the Government of the federation (SGF), Ministers and Heads of Agencies to give consideration for the appointment of youths into public service,” they said.

The letter further reads: “To re-echo your commitment to integrity, rule of law and fairness which you stand for, we strongly believe electing youths into political positions is the ultimate goal your administration will aim at”

“One of the greatest legacies you have lived for is integrity. Therefore, the choice of the next APC chairman should reflect your words, with the election of a young, energetic and vibrant Nigerian, with public trust and unquestionable character.”

","Therefore, the zonal leaders should also emerge before the national convention.
In 1980, Al-makura emerged the youth leader of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in the old Plateau state.

NANS Gives FG One-Week Ultimatum To Resolve ASUU Strike,"The National Association of Nigeria Students (NANS) has issued a one-week ultimatum to the Federal Government to resolve its disagreement with the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) or face a national mass action by Nigerian students across the country.

President of the student’s association, Sunday Adedayo, revealed this on Monday, in Sokoto shortly after signing the reviewed Constitution of the association at the Sokoto State Government House.

﻿

“The Nigerian students have concluded and given the mandate that if the Federal Government and ASUU do not resolve this between today and Friday, Nigerian students should mobilise and give the language the government understands.

“A day of national mass action has been fixed – February 28, which is next week Monday. Every Nigerian student that the ASUU strike has sent home should block all the Federal roads and the office of the Minister of Education and the office of the Minister of Labour should also be blocked. If Nigerian students are at home, office of the Minister of Education and Minister of Labour cannot be opened,” the NANS President said.

He described as unfortunate the attitude of the Federal Government who he accused of playing hide and seek with ASUU since 1999 when they signed the agreement with the academic union.

He lamented that the government has bastardised the education system at the primary and secondary level and NANS is not going to open its eyes and watch the government destroy the tertiary education.

NANS is in Sokoto for its constitutional review conference where the association reviewed its forty years Constitution at the Sokoto State University.

The reviewed Constitution was signed at the Sokoto State Government House in the presence of Sokoto State governor Aminu Tambuwal.

Speaking earlier, Governor Tambuwal appealed to ASUU to find a way of resolving their disagreement without embarking on strike.

Governor Tambuwal also called on the Federal Government to find a way of meeting the demands of ASUU despite the fact the country is facing economic challenges.","President of the student’s association, Sunday Adedayo, revealed this on Monday, in Sokoto shortly after signing the reviewed Constitution of the association at the Sokoto State Government House.

"Fuel Scarcity Was Due To Inspection Failure, Adulterated Products – FG","The Federal Government has admitted that the fuel scarcity was not because of the absence of supply of products but due to inspection failure, which allowed adulterated products into the country.

In a statement by the Senior Adviser on Media and Communications to the Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Horatius Egua, the Federal Government noted that such action is regrettable.

“The Federal Government sympathizes with the citizenry over the unforeseen hardship, occasioned by the inevitable scarcity. Let me once again appeal to Nigerians to be patient with the government in finding lasting solutions to the crisis.

“We appreciate the NNPC for showing so much concern to the plight of Nigerians by coming forward with an apology. This is unprecedented and shows that we on the government side are not afraid to take responsibility”, he said.

Egua noted that the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority has been out on the streets; filling station by filling station to ensure that the situation normalizes quickly.

“This is a time that calls for collective action to save a situation that was not foreseen. It is not a time to trade blames as is customary in Nigeria. It is therefore not a time to query anyone but a time to come together to salvage the plight of the average Nigerian.

“After the storm settles there will be time enough to investigate and get to the bottom so that this does not repeat itself.

“Mr. President’s charge to all parties and agencies concerned is to work together to ensure that normalcy returns quickly’, the statement added.

He said that Nigerians deserve the best and President Muhammadu Buhari’s government is determined to set the country on the right path of petroleum products availability and sustainability as demonstrated in the award of the contracts for the rehabilitation of all our refineries and the acquisition of a stake in the Dangote Refinery.

“Let us as Nigerians stand shoulder to shoulder in our shared quest for a greater country,” he noted.","The Federal Government has admitted that the fuel scarcity was not because of the absence of supply of products but due to inspection failure, which allowed adulterated products into the country.

Perpetrators Of Abia Cattle Market Killing Won’t Go Unpunished –  Gov Ikpeazu,"The Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has described the recent killing at the newly relocated Omuma-Uzo Cattle Market/ Abattoir in Ukwa West as unfortunate but vowed that the perpetrators will be punished.

He stated this at the Governor’s Lodge, Aba while receiving leaders of the Hausa Community from Gombe and Adamawa states.

“This administration takes issues of peace and harmony very seriously because there cannot be any form of sustainable development in an insecure environment,” he noted.

“I want to let you know that I recognise the need for peaceful co-existence between Abians and those who have come to transact legitimate business in the state, and am assuring you that the security chiefs in the state are working tirelessly to fish out the perpetrators of that ugly incident, who will not go unpunished”.

The governor, who commiserated with them especially the families of those who died in the sad incident, hinted that setting up a conflict resolution committee was to help in resolving the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers. He said the state government pays some compensation to either the farmer or herdsmen who lose their crops or cattle after a proper assessment of the situation.

According to him, the government will support the families of those who lost their lives during the attack and pay the medical bills of the injured. Ikpeazu also assured that those whose cows and goats were killed will be assisted to help them carry on with their businesses. He noted that the attack affected not just Hausas but Igbos, faulting the impression that only Hausas were in the business of selling.

The governor equally regretted the increasing level of insecurity in the country, lamenting that lives no longer mean anything to some people. He, however, assured the Hausa Community to live in the state without fear as his administration will protect their lives and property.

The Chairman, Hausa Cattle Market, Ibrahim Njidda, who also spoke at the event, recalled the cordial relationship Governor Ikpeazu shares with them in the state but regretted the recent incident. He appealed to the governor to assist them, consider getting them an alternative location for their trade and provide adequate security for them.","The Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has described the recent killing at the newly relocated Omuma-Uzo Cattle Market/ Abattoir in Ukwa West as unfortunate but vowed that the perpetrators will be punished.

Nigeria: Groups Urge Central Bank Chief Emefiele to Join Race for Presidency,"Two separate groups, The Mass Interest Project (TMIP)and The Youth For Transparency Initiative (TYTI) have called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to contest for the 2023 Presidency.

The Mass Interest Project, has urged Emefiele, to throw his hat in the ring and contest the 2023 presidential election.

In a statement, titled, ”The Charge 2023”, issued weekend, TMIP, said the country’s next president should be an experienced entrepreneur and or a business leader, adding that the person the cap best fits to take over the mantle of leadership in the country was no other than the CBN governor.

On his part, President, TYTI, Koko Umar, in a statement yesterday, in Kaduna,said the CBN governor was one of the great Nigerians who had demonstrated competence and capacity in public service and should be trusted with the leadership of the country.

The group said, as the governor of the CBN, Emefiele has made tremendous achievements that qualifies him to run for the presidency in 2023.

“One of the great Nigerians who has contributed to the development of country is the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Godwin Emefiele,” the group said.

According to TMIP, ”As expected, there is already tension across the country. From East to West, North to South, Nigerians are beginning to feel the heat as the political gladiators go on the hustings, perfecting their art to play the game to know how tom play with ruthless efficiency.

”These are men and some women who are well versed in political deception, intimidation, blackmail and are also experts in the arts of violence which they readily deploy to exact vengeance or force compliance to their will and desire.

”They are also adept at making promises they cannot keep or are not capable of supporting. They have been there from the beginning, from the First Republic, Second Republic, Third Republic, Fourth Republic and continued to rule the coast, even up to the present political dispensation.

”We, the people, work to manifest the Nigeria of our hope on our way to greatness! We march, fiercely guarding the vision and liberty to build a Nigeria we believe in, not a career politicians but as citizens with an equal stake in this Republic.

”Yes, we are on the march, in search of the next leader of our country. Behold we have found a man with a proven track record of loyalty, patriotism and understanding for sustainable development. A man, whose name connotes a date with destiny.

”Godwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele, would you lead our people on this march for a better Nigeria? Would you lead The Charge 2023?

Similarly, the TYTI maintained that since his appointment as CBN governor in 2014, Emefiele has been relentless in building a strong financial system to strengthen the nation’s economy.

“His unrelenting efforts at the apex bank has helped to navigate the Nigerian economy through turbulent economic challenges to growth and inclusiveness in policy development and implementation.

“Under Emefiele the (CBN) is more people focused, as its policies and programmes are tailored towards supporting small businesses and job creation.

“Under his leadership, the CBN introduced various interventions, which aimed at growing the economy, job creation and lifting people out of poverty.

“Under him, the CBN introduced 37 intervention funds targeted at stimulating the economy and addressing the issue of unemployment.

“Through the development finance initiatives, the bank granted N756.51 billion to 3,734,938 small holder farmers of which N120.24 billion was extended for the 2021 Wet Season to 627,051 farmers under the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP)”, the group enumerated.

According to the group, this has revolutionised rice production in Nigeria, saving the country from spend over N356 billion annually on rice importation which had hitherto affected local production negatively.

“The rice pyramid recently showcased in Abuja is a proof that we have broken the chains of rice importation,” it said.

The statement further noted Emefiele’s achievements in implementation of the National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF), in which the CBN released N3.0 billion to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 SMEs.

“In the creative industry, N3.22 billion was disbursed to 356 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, software development, fashion, and IT verticals, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI)

“Also the CBN under the N1.0 trillion Real Sector Facility, released N923.41 billion to 251 real sector projects, of which 87 were in light manufacturing, 40 in agro based industry, 32 in services and 11 in mining.

In the health sector the CBN disbursed N98.41 billion for 103 health projects under the bank’s Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF).

“These are just a few of the many achievements recorded by Emefiele the past seven years at the apex bank.

“His significant support for the Nigerian economy through the use of intervention funds to boost growth is laudable.

“He has proven himself to be a diligent and determined public servant whose track records will remain indelible in history.

“It is for this that the TYTI wishes to passionately appeal to Emefiele to contest for the 2023 presidency.”

The group appealed to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) present the best candidate for the 2023 Presidency, stressing that “Emefiele is the best because he has demonstrated competence and capacity that qualifies him to be the President of Nigeria.

Although the CBN governor has not openly declared interest to contest the 2023 presidential election, several groups have in the past few weeks, been clamouring for his declaration of interest in the race, saying the country was at a point technocrats needed to take over the reins of power and steer it out of its present predicament.

"NGO Claims 250,000 Young Nigerians Undergoing Sexual, Labour Exploitations in Mali – Arise News","A Non-governmental Organisation (NGO), Network Against Child Trafficking, Abuse and Labour (NACTAL) has raised the alarm that over 250, 000 young Nigerian boys and girls are currently undergoing various forms of exploitations including sexual and labour in different places in Mali.

The National President of the network, Mr. AbduGaniyu Abubakar who made the disclosure on Sunday, in Abuja, however called on the federal government and other relevant authorities including civil groups to do everything humanly possible to rescue them.

He was speaking shortly after the arrival of 15 females and a three years old boy, who were victims of human trafficking rescued from Mali arrived the Abuja International Airport.

The victims who were sexually exploited in various mining sites in Mali were between the ages of 18 and 25 years and have spent around five years in captivity until their rescue recently.

According to the NACTAL President, the victims had escaped from their captors and took solace in the shelter of some NGOs working against human trafficking, sexual, child abuse and labour in Mali.

Meanwhile, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP), who brought the children back to the country, reassured that the agency would continue to do its best to rescue Nigerians trafficked for sexual and labour exploitations wherever they may be in the world.

Nigerian Airlines Hike Fares as Aviation Fuel Rises to N420 Per Litre,"Less than 10 days after domestic airlines lamented that oil marketers have increased price of Jet A1 (aviation fuel) to N400 per litre, the price of the product has increased to N420 per litre in Lagos and N450 per litre at other airports outside Lagos and Abuja.

This has prompted domestic airlines to increase base fare to over N50, 000 per flight.

THISDAY learnt the price of aviation fuel increased to N420 per litre on Sunday, as against the N400 per litre it was on Thursday, without prior notice to the airlines.

But depending on the city where the airport is located, the price hovers around N420 and N450 per litre, especially in northern part of the country, where it is predicted that the price could rise to N500 per litre in few days.

THISDAY also learnt that as the price is now subject to the exchange rate of the naira against the dollars, until when the country begins to refine the product locally.

“As at today (Sunday), a litre of fuel goes for N420 in Lagos and it is between N430 and N450 in some northern states. The fact is that the price of the product may go higher as aviation fuel is scarce in the country.

“About three weeks ago, the product was scarce in all the airports in the country and this contributed to some of the delayed flights we experienced at that period. The government needs to arrest the situation before it goes out of hand,” a source told THISDAY.

Defending the increase in airfares, a spokesman of one of the major domestic airlines told THISDAY that the new fares were a response to the increase in the price of aviation fuel, the increase in the cost of handling rates by aviation handling companies and also the exchange rate.

The official said airlines had to increase fares in order to survive, insisting that without that, most of the airlines would not continue to operate in the next three months, adding that until now, airlines have been subsidizing the base fare.

“We increase fare in reaction to the cost of aviation fuel, which is increasing daily without prior warning to airlines. We sell tickets at lower price but we airlift passengers at the new aviation fuel prices, which means we are incurring heavy losses. If we do not increase fares, many of us will not last three months.

“We are batting with poor infrastructure, exchange rate depreciation, high price of aviation fuel and increase in the price of handing by aviation handling companies. If you go to market to buy to resell and find out that prices have suddenly gone up will you sell at the same old price? No! We are feeling the economic pinch together.

“We should put the blame where it should be and these are forex, aviation fuel, which is biggest reason for the hike,” the spokesman said.

But reacting to the increased fares by airlines, the former CEO of Aero Contractors and former Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Ado Sanusi, condemned the decision of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) to increase fares, saying that such decision was against free economy and against anti-trust laws.

“I am not against the increase in airfares in response to high cost of operation, increase in the price of aviation fuel, but AON cannot come out and fix prices of tickets. That is against the law and against free economy.

“Every airline should look at its own costs and decide the fares. When you fix fares, some airlines will be affected negatively and it could lead to them going under because airlines have different financial models and so should fix their own fares,” he said.

Another spokesman of one of the airlines, however, told THISDAY that AON did not fix fares for the airlines; rather, each airline recognising its operational challenges in terms of finance, decided to increase fares, disclosing that it was not every airline that pegged its base fare to N50, 000.

Also, a top official of AON told THISDAY that he was not aware that the association fixed fares for airlines, stressing that airlines fixed the fares by themselves.

According to the operators, aviation fuel takes between 35 to 40 per cent of total cost of airlines and some of the stakeholders are concerned that some of the operators may be compelled to shut operations if the challenges in the sub-sector were no urgent intervention by government.

About two weeks ago, the Chairman, United Nigeria Airlines (UNA), Dr. Obiora Okonkwo had raised the alarm that the price of aviation fuel rose by over 100 per cent in the last one year.

He had emphasised that the exchange rate had also depreciated from N340 to N570 to a dollar within the same period, stressing that it was pertinent for the government to look critically into the development of the industry in order to arrest collapse.

“This electoral victory is not only for him (Oyetola), but also for the APC and the APC members in Osun. They must all come together so that come July 16, the progressive ideals of the APC can continue to hold supreme in the state and Governor Oyetola can continue to deliver the dividends of democracy and good governance to our people.”

Abia 2023: Ikwuano PDP stakeholders disown purported communique on guber zoning,".

By Steve Oko

The agitation for power shift to Abia North senatorial district in 2023 may have hit the rocks as the stakeholders of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Abia, have disowned a communique purportedly issued after the meeting of Ikwuano/Umuahia stakeholders last week.

In the purported communique, stakeholders from Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constituency were said to have endorsed a power shift to Abia North in 2023.

But Ikwuano PDP stakeholders who said they were in the said meeting distanced themselves from the purported governoship zoning which according to them was never mentioned at the meeting.

Addressing newsmen Monday in Umuahia, the stakeholders who said there was no official communique emanating from the meeting dismissed it as ” fake and obnoxious”.

In a communique signed by former Leader of Abia State House of Assembly, Hon. Wisdom Ogbonna; Hon. Clement Onukwue; and read by the Chairman Ikwuano PDP stakeholders, Rear Admiral Ralph Osondu (retd.); the stakeholders urged members of the public to discountenance the said communique.

It read in part: ” The attention of Ikwuano PDP stakeholders has been drawn to the circulation of a fake communique arising from a well-attended meeting of the PDP political stakeholders of Ikwuano/Umuahia held on Tuesday, February 15, at the residence of Hon. Jerry Uzosike.”

Ikwuano PDP stakeholders rather clarified that contrary to the claims of the purported communique, below was the resolution at the meeting:

“That the good people of Ikwuano/Umuahia of Abia Central Senatorial Zone are eminently qualified and will contest for the governorship of Abia State, come 2023.

“That our sons and daughters who want to contest are free to enter the race and will receive maximum support of our people.

” That it is the turn of Ngwa extraction (Umunne ato) to run for Abia Central Senatorial seat and should be left as such.

Therefore, sons and daughters of Ikwuano/Umuahia extraction are not encouraged to run for the Senate.”

The communique which further read: “We, the PDP Stakeholders of Ikwuano do hereby state as follows:

“That at no point, during deliberations, was the issue of zoning of governorship position mentioned or discussed since this is the exclusive prerogative of the Party. It was not part of the motions moved, supported and adopted.

“That, in respect of that meeting, no communique has, so far, been released officially by the Ikwuano/Umuahia Forum.

“That any communique, being circulated and containing the support for zoning of governorship position to any zone does not have the endorsement of Ikwuano PDP Stakeholders.

” That Ikwuano PDP Stakeholders hereby STRONGLY DISSOCIATE _ itself from the obnoxious communique in circulation.”

The stakeholders restated their loyalty to Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu, and the leadership of Abia PDP.

Other signatories of the communique were Chief BC Mgbaramuko, Chief Chinkwe Ndimele, and Secretary to the forum, Pastor Ekeleme Ikeji.","In the purported communique, stakeholders from Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constituency were said to have endorsed a power shift to Abia North in 2023.

"FAAN orders AIB, Caverton, others to relocate","The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has given the Accident Investigation Bureau – Nigeria (AIB-N) and other entities with facilities at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos quit notice.

Other organisations that will be affected by this order include Caverton, Dominion, Evergreen Apple Nigeria and ExecuJet hangars.

Experts have, however, faulted the deadline.

The notice came barely a week after the National Assembly Joint Committee on Aviation, led by Senator Smart Adeyemi and Hon. Nnolim Nnaji Aviation, warned FAAN against demolishing the affected offices and private hangars at Lagos Airport, because it would cost the country billions of naira.

It was learnt that the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), the Federal Road Service Corps (FRSC) and the towing firms close to the AIB-N regional headquarters in Lagos were affected by the order.

Though FAAN confirmed the notice to the agencies with offices close to the airside, it said it did not attach a deadline to it.

FAAN stated that the agency would not compensate the affected organisations but that it would provide them land.

If FAAN carries out its threat, properties worth billions of Naira belonging to these entities would be affected.

For instance, AIB-N, has its regional headquarters that was the agency’s head office until the mid-2020 when the Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika, gave it and other aviation agencies a marching order to move to Abuja office.

The facility houses its office complex, Command & Control Centre, office of investigators and Information Communication Technology (ICT) department.

Apart from the cost of the land, it was learnt that AIB-N’s facilities in Lagos regional office are worth over N5 billion.

Most of the facilities at the AIB-N’s office in Lagos were installed less than four years ago by Mr. Akin Olateru-led management team.

While FAAN has issued the eviction order, the affected organisations who are not comfortable that bitter about the development may be heading to court to challenge their eviction.

A source close to one of the two towing firms affected confirmed the notice and that the letter conveying the message was signed by the Managing Director of FAAN, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu.

The reason for wanting to evict AIB-N and other organisations, it was learnt, was to allow the Chinese contractors building the terminal at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport to use the offices demolished as apron.

It would be recalled that FAAN had contended that the organisations doing businesses at that corridor were making it difficult for it to expand the new terminal still under construction.

But the organisations on their part had argued that they received valid and approved papers from the relevant authorities before constructing their offices at the present locations, wondering why FAAN is now asking them to vacate the same place they got approvals for.

They further argued that they were not the problem but that the challenge lied with the terminal that was not well-located.

The General Manager, Corporate Communications, FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, confirmed the development.

She explained that FAAN would give the affected organisations new land within the airport.

She added that the affected organisations were not given two weeks to relocate as being speculated.

“FAAN is relocating those offices that have been asked to move,” she added.","Other organisations that will be affected by this order include Caverton, Dominion, Evergreen Apple Nigeria and ExecuJet hangars.

Ex-minister Bolaji Abdullahi declares senatorial ambition,"By Olayinka Owolewa

A former minister of Sports and Youth Development, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, has declared his intention to contest the Kwara Central senatorial seat in 2023.

The former minister, who was accompanied to the party’s secretariat by a mammoth crowd of supporters and well wishers, presented his Letter of Intent to the PDP state chairman, Mr Babatunde Mohammed.

Abdullahi said 2023 provides another opportunity for patriotic Nigerians to make themselves available for service to salvage the country.

“Nigeria is at the moment faced with numerous problems. Insecurity has assumed alarming proportion.

“Nigerians are losing their lives in thousands daily. Most Nigerians are unable to feed themselves; do not have access to healthcare and education.

“Nigerian youths have become destabilising force because of our inability to provide jobs for them.

“Therefore, we need leaders that will take Nigeria out of these problems. 2023 provides us the opportunity to move the nation out of the doldrums.This is the time for patriotic Nigerians to offer themselves for service.

US Announces First Sanctions After Russia Recognizes Ukraine Separatists,"The United States announced financial sanctions Monday against rebel territories in eastern Ukraine freshly recognized by Russia and warned that more were ready if necessary.

President Joe Biden will issue an executive order to “prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by US persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, referring to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The order will “provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine,” Psaki said, adding that the measures are separate from wider Western sanctions ready to go “should Russia further invade Ukraine.”

READ ALSO: World Leaders Condemn Russian Decision On Ukraine

The two self-proclaimed republics already have extremely limited dealings with US citizens. However, the sanctions herald a new phase in what could soon become the most dangerous East-West confrontation since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed Russia’s recognition of the separatist regions as a sign President Vladimir Putin had no interest in diplomacy.

Blinken said in a statement that recognizing the territories’ independence “directly contradicts Russia’s claimed commitment to diplomacy, and is a clear attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty.”

“Russia’s decision is yet another example of President Putin’s flagrant disrespect for international law and norms,” he said, adding in a separate tweet that the United States “will take appropriate steps in coordination with partners.”

Biden has led a coalition of European and other US allies to craft a package of what they say will be crippling economic sanctions on Russia should troops massing on Ukraine’s borders start an attack.

While the Kremlin has for weeks denied invasion plans, it has at the same time built up an enormous force of troops and heavy weaponry on three sides of Ukraine.

Shortly after recognizing their independence, Putin ordered troops into the two breakwaway regions as part of a “peacekeeping” operation.

Moscow provided no details or date for any deployment, with the order saying only that it “comes into force from the day it was signed”.

On Friday, the deputy US national security advisor for international economics, Daleep Singh, warned that sanctions would turn Russia into an international “pariah.”

Moscow has for years been giving the separatist rebels covert financial, political and military backing.

The White House said that after Putin recognized the regions as independent, Biden talked by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for 35 minutes to “reaffirm” the US commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty. He also detailed the plan for sanctions on Russia.

Biden later spoke for half an hour with two key European allies — French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, an official said. The three leaders “strongly condemned” Putin’s decision and discussed how to coordinate their response.

The White House did not respond immediately to questions about whether there was still any consideration being given to a suggested summit between Biden and Putin.","The United States announced financial sanctions Monday against rebel territories in eastern Ukraine freshly recognized by Russia and warned that more were ready if necessary.

"Benin Bronzes: FG to construct museum for repatriated artefacts, says NCMM DG","The Federal Government is to accelerate action on the construction of a royal palace museum where the Benin bronze artefacts that were repatriated from Germany would be kept.

The Director-General, National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Prof. Abba Tijani, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Ibadan.

Artefacts worth £2.5 million have been handed over to the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, by President Muhammadu Buhari, 125 years after they were looted by British troops during the invasion of Benin Kingdom.

The returned artefacts, comprising of a cockerel (okpa) and an Oba head (Uhunwun Elao), were repatriated from Cambridge University, Jesus College, and University of Aberdeen, Scotland, respectively.

They were handed over to the traditional ruler by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Tunji Ishola, on behalf of the President.

Tijani said, “We need the cooperation and involvement of all stakeholders in promoting the return of more artefacts.

“We need to build a solid structure on ground, especially in Abuja and Benin City for the artefacts to survive when they are brought in.

“Everyone especially the youths should be encouraged to visit museums to see our past and understand our culture which also determines who we really are.

“Many social vices going on now are due to lack of understanding of our culture and history,” he said.

Tijjani said the country took possession of the artefacts in 2021 but could not bring it home then due to lack of export permits.

He added that since then, arrangements were made with Benin on ways to get export permits to return the artefacts to the country.

“It is a great achievement for the country and the Benin Kingdom to regain the stolen artefacts after 125 years.

“Also, at some point in time, the artefacts which are of cultural importance will be displayed for all Nigerians and foreigners to see them in their rightful places.

“This will attract more tourists to the country and definitely boost tourism,” he said.

The federal government has been making arrangements on ways to return thousands of other artefacts looted from the country.

“We have no fewer than 5,000 Benin Bronzes scattered all over the world.

“We are able to negotiate with the German government and agreed to repatriate no fewer than 1,000 artefacts from Germany.

“Also plans are on to return many other artefacts from Washington, Cambridge, Oxford University and other countries, we are going to sign the agreement within one month or two, so that we can start getting the artefacts back,” he said.

He urged individuals, relevant tourism agencies and private sectors to cooperate with the commission and federal government to make this goal of returning all artefacts a reality.

President Buhari on Monday commended the NCMM for collaborative works that led to the repatriation of these artefacts.

The President said it is noteworthy that several others are currently in the process of being returned while discussions are ongoing to repatriate many more.

President Buhari recounted that the artefacts now returned to the Oba of Benin were taken away by British soldiers in 1897 when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom and took thousands of artefacts away.

”These artefacts are part of the records of the history of the Benin people.

”My directive to return these artefacts to the Oba of Benin marks the beginning of another aspect in the highly valued relationship between the Federal Government of Nigeria and our traditional institutions who are indeed the true custodians of our history, customs and traditions.

World leaders condemn Russian decision on Ukraine,"Western powers reacted swiftly to Monday’s decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin to recognise the independence of the two self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine, condemning Moscow and calling for sanctions.

Here is a summary of the responses so far:

Move ‘won’t go unanswered’: Biden, Macron, Scholz

The leaders of France, Germany and the United States condemned Putin’s move as a “clear breach” of the Minsk peace agreements.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden agreed that “this step will not go unanswered”, the German chancellery said in a statement published following their conversation.

United States announces sanctions

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that Putin’s decision required “a swift and firm response, and we will take appropriate steps in coordination with partners”.

The United States announced financial sanctions against the rebel territories freshly recognized by Russia in eastern Ukraine and warned that more were ready if necessary.

United Nations condemns ‘violation’

UN chief Antonio Guterres said Russia’s decision amounted to “a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations”.

France calls for emergency UN meeting

French President Emmanuel Macron, who was still pressing for a diplomatic settlement earlier Monday, called for targeted European Union sanctions against Moscow.

“He is demanding an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council as well as the adoption of targeted European sanctions,” said a statement from his office.

UK prepares ‘robust’ sanctions

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson denounced Putin’s decision as “a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine”.

A “very robust package of sanctions” would be triggered “with the first toecap of a Russian incursion or Russian invasion”, he added.

Germany says Moscow ‘breaking all its promises’

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Moscow was breaking the Minsk peace agreements that it signed in 2014.

“With its decision, Russia is breaking all its promises to the world community,” she said.

NATO says Russia seeks ‘pretext to invade Ukraine’

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Putin’s decision “further undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, erodes efforts towards a resolution of the conflict, and violates the Minsk Agreements, to which Russia is a party.

“Moscow continues to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine by providing financial and military support to the separatists. It is also trying to stage a pretext to invade Ukraine once again,” he added.

EU vows unified response

Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the European Union’s two most senior figures, posted identical statements on Twitter.

Condemning Putin’s move as “a blatant violation of international law”, they added: “The EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine.”

Bad fuel: Northern groups withdraw call for sack of NNPC mgt,"By Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo



A group, the Concerned Northern Forum, has rescinded its earlier call for the sack of the management of the NNPC over the adulterated fuel that was imported into Nigeria.



Mallam Ibrahim Bature, Chairman Concerned Northern Forum and Abdulsalam Kazeem, spokesperson of the forum, in a statement in Kaduna, said “it has become inevitable to put the records straight that our position has no political affiliation or influence nor been sponsored by any individual or groups. Our call was borne out of patriotism over the hardship occasioned by the scarcity of premium motor spirit and the huge economic impact of the bad fuel at a time government is battling with dwindling revenue.



“In view of new information at our disposal and the attempts by certain special interests to hijack our demand and use our position to blackmail the present NNPC management over the current artificial PMS scarcity occasioned by marketers dispensing fewer pumps at a time, we hereby state that following the operational error of methanol in PMS above our national specification, which remains an unforeseen problem, we back the call for thorough investigation as ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari and urge security agencies to conclude the probe in good time and sanction all those responsible.



“We commend the management of the NNPC Ltd for taking prompt action by alerting the nation on the bad fuel and for taking measured steps to recall the bad product and injecting over 700 million litres and the promise of additional 2.1billion litres to address the shortfall.”

“We demand that regulatory and security agencies ensure that fuel stations sell at the maximum installed capacity and in the event any station is found to be sabotaging government’s effort, the product be dispensed free to motorists and such station sealed. We withdraw our notice for the sack of the NNPC management and nationwide protest but remain committed to the sanctioning of the importing companies and their officials.”

"Attack on Abia cattle market: Ikpeazu, Northern community leaders meet",".

…Victims families to bed compensated – Govt

By Steve Oko

Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has restated the avowed commitment of his administration towards prioritizing the security and welfare of all law-abiding residents in the state irrespective of where they come from, as he describes the ugly incident at the newly relocated Omuma Uzor Cattle Market/ Abattoir in Ukwa West as unfortunate and condemnable.

Governor Ikpeazu who stated this at the Governor’s Lodge, Aba while receiving leaders of the Hausa Community in Aba together with Hausa Leaders from Gombe and Adamawa states, commiserated with them especially the families of those who died in the said incident.

The Governor said that his administration takes issues of peace and harmony very seriously because there cannot be any form of sustainable development in an insecure environment.

He said that this was the philosophy behind the decision of his administration to devise a means to resolve conflicts between the herdsmen and farmers in the State by setting up a Conflict Resolution Committee where the State Government undertakes to pay some compensation to either the farmer or the herdsmen who lose his crops or cows, after a proper assessment of the circumstances of the situation.

Ikpeazu said that he recognized the need for peaceful co-existence between Abians and those who have come to transact legitimate business in the State, disclosing that the security chiefs in the state are working tirelessly to fish out the perpetrators of that ugly incident.

He said that those behind the incident would not go unpunished.

The Governor also assured that every necessary step would be taken to avert future occurrences of such dastardly acts.

He lamented the festering insecurity in Nigeria, saying the country is becoming a place where the sanctity of human life no longer has meaning to some persons.

Ikpeazu promised that the State Government would provide some form of support for the families of those who lost their lives during the attack and take care of the medical bills of the injured as well as assist those whose cows and goats were killed to enable them to carry on with their businesses.

He noted that the attack affected not just Hausas but Igbos also, noting that the impression that only Hausas were in the business of selling cows was wrong.

Speaking earlier, the Chairman Hausa Cattle Market – Alhaji Ibrahim Njidda who briefed the Governor on the incident, recalled the very cordial relationship Governor Ikpeazu shares with them in the state and regretted the ugly incident.

He appealed to the Governor to assist them and also consider getting them an alternative location for their trade and the provision of adequate security for them.

Also speaking, the Patron of the Aba Hausa Community, Alhaji Musa Iheakaram thanked Governor Okezie Ikpeazu for his quick intervention through his Chief of Staff – Prof Agbazuere and other key government officials while he was away and for his personal visit to the place.

He also pleaded for an alternative location for their business.

Executive Chairman Ukwa West LGA, Chief Okey Kanu said that the Hausa Community enjoyed a good relationship with their host Community within that short period before the incident and requested that security be fortified in the area.

Present at the meeting were Commissioners for Trade and Investment, Homeland Security, Chief John Okiyi Kalu; and Hon. Sopuruchi Bekee; Chief of Staff to the Governor, Professor Agbazuere; and the Deputy Chairman of Ukwa West LGA, Hon. John Ajuzieogu.

Others were the Traditional Ruler of Asa North Community, Eze Emeka Ottah; the Sarki Hausa of Aba, Alhaji Shehu Bello as well as the Special Adviser to the Governor on Homeland Security, Mr Chigozie Ubani.

"BREAKING: Court extends detention order on detained DCP, Abba Kyari","A Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday extended the detention of a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, by 14 days.

The court granted permission to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to hold the embattled Kyari for the period to enable the agency to complete its investigation into the hard drug trafficking allegations against him.

Justice Zainab Abubakar issued the order for Kyari’s further detention while ruling in an ex-parte application argued by the NDLEA counsel, Mr Mike Kassa.

The NDLEA had, in the application, pleaded for more time to detain Kyari on the ground that the hard drug trafficking allegations against the suspect were complex and may require the agency travelling outside the shore of the country to make some clarifications.

The counsel asked the court to grant the detention extension in the interest of justice and to be fair to the suspect too through diligent investigation.

In a short ruling, Justice Abubakar ordered that Abba Kyari be detained for another 14 days.

The judge however ordered that the 14 days further detention should start counting from February 22.

IMF warns FG over proposed N2.55trn fuel subsidy spending,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the Nigerian government will likely depend on overdrafts from the Central Bank of Nigeria to fund its proposed N2.55 trillion petrol subsidy bill if it extends it by 18 months.

The IMF report titled, “Nigeria: Selected Issues Paper” was prepared by a staff team of the Fund as background documentation for its periodic consultation with Nigeria.

It noted that the fuel subsidy negatively affects the country’s fiscal position, thereby increasing the country’s fiscal deficit.

According to the Washington-based lender, “Implicit fuel subsidies have a significant negative impact on Nigeria’s fiscal position, which is estimated to increase the overall fiscal deficit by around one percentage point of the Gross Domestic Product in 2021.”

It added that despite much higher oil prices, the general government fiscal deficit is projected to be significantly worse at 6.3 per cent of the GDP, compared to 4.7 per cent of GDP in the 2020 Article IV staff report.

It said it is mainly reflecting the reemergence of implicit fuel subsidies and higher spending in the supplementary budget for security and vaccine costs.

The report opined that the government would likely depend hugely on domestic financing sources, which include borrowing from the CBN, saying that fuel subsidy has been a substantial burden on the country.

It assumed that implicit fuel subsidies exist only until mid-2022, as stipulated in the Petroleum Industry Act and assumed in the draft 2022 budget, pointing out that fiscal vulnerabilities remain elevated with public debt continuously increasing from 35 per cent of the GDP in 2020 to over 42 per cent in 2026.

With limited IFI funding, the report stated that fiscal financing for large implicit subsidy costs is likely to depend heavily on domestic sources, including overdrafts from the CBN.

It stated that the recent re-emergence of implicit fuel subsidies has levied a considerable burden on Nigeria’s fiscal position, that could have been spent more effectively on pro-poor interventions.

The World Bank had, however, warned the Federal Government against financing its deficits by borrowing from the CBN through the Ways and Means Advances, saying that it puts fiscal pressures on the country’s expenditures.

It observed that central bank financing and fuel subsidy regime tend to adversely affect investments in human and physical capital.

The report said that the Federal Government’s total borrowing from the CBN through Ways and Means Advances had ballooned by 2,286 per cent to N15.51tn in six years, according to the central bank data, stressing that N15.51tn owed by the Federal Government to the central bank is not part of the country’s total public debt stock, which stood at N38tn as of September 2021.","It noted that the fuel subsidy negatively affects the country’s fiscal position, thereby increasing the country’s fiscal deficit.

The statement reads in part: “Our attention has been drawn to the refusal by the DSS in Abuja to allow family members and lawyer to our leader, Mazi Nnamdi KANU during the routine visitation in DSS custody on Monday.

“We also recall that the DSS did not also allow family members and lawyer access to our leader last week Thursday when they went to see him.

“We, are therefore, putting the world on notice, that if anything untoward happens to our leader, Mazi Nnamdi KANU, Nigeria government and its security agencies should be held responsible for the bitter consequences of such avoidable scenario.

‘By then they will understand that our peaceful disposition is never a sign of weakness!

“Our legal team visited DSS Abuja on Thursday last week but the DSS refused to allow them to see our leader. Today again, Monday 21st of February, 2022, Nigeria DSS denied them access to our leader, Mazi Nnamdi KANU.

“For now, we are not sure of his state of health or if he is still alive at all. DSS should open up and tell the world why they are shielding our leader from the family and Lawyers. Have they eliminated Mazi Nnamdi KANU?

“We are informing the international community and all diplomatic missions in Abuja to be aware of the provocative actions of DSS. Nobody should blame IPOB for anything because the Nigeria Government and its security agencies have pushed us to the wall enough.

“DSS must know that if anything happens to our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU, the consequences will be catastrophic. Nigeria government and DSS Director should also know that Nnamdi KANU is prisoner of conscience and should not be tampered anyhow and there is no option for them than to release him unconditionally or they bear the consequences of keeping him in their custody for so long in Abuja.

“The whole world should take note of these atrocities, both the Amnesty International and all reputable Human Rights Organisations across the world because his detention is going to bring dangerous action in Nigeria in the near future.","The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has raised the alarm over alleged refusal by the Department of State Services (DSS) to allow family members and lawyers to its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu during routine visitation in its custody.

"Return Nigeria’s Artefacts in Your Possession, Buhari Pleads with Nations, Institutions","•Says 1,130 Benin bronzes due back from Germany this year

Deji Elumoye in Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to countries, institutions, and bodies, both private and public, to return Nigeria’s artefacts in their possession. Buhari also disclosed that 1,130 Benin bronzes would be returned to Nigeria by the German government before the end of this year.

Reacting to the recent return of two important Nigerian artefacts from Britain, the president, in a statement yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, welcomed the official handover, on Saturday, of the Okwukor and the Head of an Oba of Benin Bronzes, to the Oba of Benin, His Royal Highness, Oba Ewuare II. The artefacts were repatriated from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen, respectively, in the United Kingdom, after 125 years of their leaving the territory of present day Nigeria.

In a passionate plea for return of the objects, which form a significant part of the country’s rich cultural heritage, Buhari recalled that the artefacts, now returned to the Oba of Benin, were taken away by British soldiers in 1897, when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom and took thousands of items away.

According to the president, “These artefacts are part of the records of the history of the Benin people. My directive to return these artefacts to the Oba of Benin marks the beginning of another aspect in the highly valued relationship between the federal government of Nigeria and our traditional institutions who are, indeed, the true custodians of our history, customs, and traditions.

“This directive is also significant because it will introduce a working relationship between the federal government, as represented by the NCMM, and the traditional institutions whereby this commission negotiates the release of antiquities from foreign museums and institutions on behalf of Nigeria and the traditional institutions that lost the antiquities and jointly they all take steps to ensure the valourisation of Nigerian and Nigerian people through these great arts and cultural emblems.”

While urging other countries to take a cue from the institutions, the president vowed that the federal government would pursue the repatriation of Nigerian artefacts vigorously. He pledged that government would ensure that they were put to good and proper use on their return in museums and other facilities in conjunction with the royal families and kingdoms that lost these artefacts.

The president noted that in line with international law and practice, export, import, and control over antiquities were matters within the purview of national governments, to be exercised on behalf of sub-national authorities, institutions and bodies. He thanked the government of the United Kingdom that facilitated the return of the artefacts by issuing the prerequisite Export Permits to Nigeria at no cost, as well as the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen who agreed to return these artefacts to Nigeria.

“These are unprecedented moves worth emulating by others,” he said, adding that the federal government hopes to work hand in hand with the British authorities in the future to encourage the return of more Nigerian artefacts from the United Kingdom.

Buhari also appreciated the Federal Republic of Germany, which was planning the process of repatriating 1,130 Benin bronzes to Nigeria this year from many of Germany’s public museums.

He also commended the High Commissioner of Nigeria to the United Kingdom, Sarafa Ishola, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) for their collaborative works that led to the repatriation of the artefacts. According to him, it is noteworthy that several others are currently in the process of being returned while discussions are on-going to repatriate many more.

"Again, APC Moves Convention, Now to Hold March 26","•Keeps mum on zoning of party offices

•Lukman: Buni, Bello, Uzodinma, two other govs frustrating convention

•Says Akpanudoedehe active in ‘ponzi scheme’

Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has resolved to hold its national convention on March 26, a month away from the February 26 it initially proposed for the convention. This was contained in a leaked letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, which the ruling party said superseded its earlier national convention notice.

The latest notice also replaced an earlier letter to INEC informing it of APC’s decision to hold its zonal congresses on March 26.

But the party was silent on the zoning of offices, a major concern for stakeholders, which was believed to have contributed to the seeming dithering over the convention.

A former Director General of Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, alleged that the chairman of APC’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello; Governor of Imo State Hope Uzodinma; and Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State were the ones frustrating the national convention plan.

APC had in an earlier letter, with reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14, notified INEC of its decision to hold its national convention on February 26. But the party said its latest notice followed an evaluation of its constitution.

It stated in the leaked letter, “In furtherance to Article 85 of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and compliance with Section 12:6 of our party constitution, we hereby write to notify the commission that our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has scheduled to hold its zonal congresses on Saturday, 26th March, 2022.

“Kindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly. While hoping to receive your cooperation, please accept the assurances of our highest esteem.”

National Secretary of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, told journalists yesterday at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja that the publication of national convention sub-committees would take on Monday, February 28.

Akpanudoedehe, who spoke at the end of a four-hour meeting of the caretaker committee, said, “We have agreed and approved that activities for the party’s national convention will commence from February 24 and terminate on March 26 at Eagle Square with the national convention. In between the convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses, and all the activities are hereby given as approved by the CECPC.”

The schedule of activities released by the party showed that the sale of forms would take place between March 9 and 11, while the screening of aspirants would happen between March 15 and 17. The screening appeal would hold on March 19, while the adoption of the appeal report would be held on Monday, March 21, according to the schedule.

The party said accreditation for the national convention would be held between March 24 and 25, while the convention would be on Saturday, March 26, and convention appeal would take place on Tuesday, March 29.

The adoption of appeal report would take place on Wednesday, March 30, while the inauguration of the party executive would hold on Thursday, March 31.

According to the schedule of activities for the zonal congresses, the publication of zonal committees would take place on February 24, while a meeting of zonal stakeholders is scheduled for February 26.

The party added that the sale of forms for zonal positions would commence on February 28 and end on March 3. It scheduled the screening of zonal aspirants for March 5, and screening appeal for March 6.

The adoption of the screening report is slated for March 8, while zonal congresses would be held on Saturday, March 12, and the zonal congresses appeal would take place on March 14.

The adoption of appeal report is scheduled for March 16.

However, Lukman, in a statement yesterday, titled, “APC Convention: Mutiny by Yahoo Yahoo Politicians,” alleged that the party was held captive by a small group of dishonest politicians whose only interest was to impose themselves as either presidential or vice-presidential candidates for the 2023 elections.

The former APC governors’ forum director-general said the caretaker committee saddled mainly with the responsibility of organising the national convention to elect new leaders of the party had reduced the majority of its members to mere observers. He said even PGF was being disrespected, as the decisions and leadership of the governor’s body were being snubbed.

Lukman said in the statement, “His Excellency Mai Mala Buni, in flagrant disregard to every known procedure of managing affairs of the party, relate only with His Excellency, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma of Imo State; and His Excellency, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, based on the plot to retain His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the party up to the time of conducting the primary that will produce candidates for 2023 elections.

“The other person, who is also active in this political ponzi scheme, is the CECPC Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, who is also aspiring to emerge as the Akwa Ibom governorship candidate of the APC for 2023 elections.”

Lukman alleged that Abiodun, Buni, Bello, and Uzodinma were all aspiring to become either presidential or vice-presidential candidates.

He added, “Although His Excellency Mai Mala Buni is not open about his ambition, some of the speculation promoted by people very close to him is that once he is the one to organise the primary to produce candidates for 2023 elections, he stands a good chance to emerge as the vice-presidential candidate, or even the presidential candidate, if the North is to produce the presidential candidate.”

In the case of Uzodinma, Lukman claimed the governor was alleged to be aspiring to emerge as vice-presidential candidate to a northern candidate, saying Bello has declared his aspiration to emerge as the 2023 presidential candidate of the party.

He explained that Abiodun was being guaranteed a second term ticket to emerge the Ogun State governorship candidate for the 2023 election, which was to block any potential contestant, given the strong opposition he faced from former Governor Ibikunle Amosun in 2019.

Lukman stressed that beyond guaranteeing Abiodun second term ticket, Buni had attempted to make similar offers to all first term governors of APC, adding that some of the stories flying around are true scripts being acted by Buni and his associates.

He stated, “It is clear that Mai Mala Buni is opposed to organising the APC national convention on February 26, 2022 or any time soon. Consequently, he is working with other dishonest leaders, notably, Yahaya Bello, Hope Uzodinma, Dapo Abiodun, and a few others.

“It is a mutiny against the authority of the party and all its designated leaders, especially, President Buhari, being carried by very dishonest people, who can best be described as Yahoo Yahoo politicians. They are busy recruiting more dishonest and questionable leaders, such as Uzor Kalu, and they are moving to recruit some state party leaders into their fold.

“As a party, APC is now in a state of emergency. Any slip will destroy the party. This is not the period to allow dishonest political leaders gamble with the survival of the party and by extension weaken the nation’s democracy. Everything must be done to restore some minimum standards of conducts by leaders at all levels.

“Everything must be done to rescue APC from the hands of these Yahoo Yahoo politicians represented by Mai Mala Buni, Yahaya Bello, Hope Uzodinma, Dapo Abiodun, Uzor Kalu, and their associates.”

Reacting to the developments, a chairmanship aspirant of the party, Mr. Sunny Monidafe, said he had no choice but to accept the decision of the party. Monidafe said, “So long as the party leadership carries all the critical stakeholders along, I don’t have any objections.”

But a group in the party, APC Rebirth group, faulted the decision to conduct the zonal congresses, saying it is alien to the party’s constitution. The group, led Aliyu Audu, said the decision was part of a calculated attempt by the Buni-led caretaker committee to elongate its tenure in office, adding, “It is a clear case of abuse of power and blatant reign of impunity. Buni will stop at nothing until he ruins the party.”

Convention: We’re Not Talking Till After Meeting With Buhari, Say APC Governors

The Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), has said that it would not comment on the timetable for the national convention and zonal congresses released by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) until it had met with President Muhammadu Buhari today.

Chairman of the Forum and the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, stated this while addressing journalists yesterday in Abuja.

“Until we finish with Mr. President, we would rather not comment on any time table or any logistics,” said Bagudu, when asked about the time-table for the convention and zonal congresses.

According to him, the Forum met to discuss developments in the states and review the election that took place in the FCT, Osun primary, the court judgment that dissolved the Kano Congress and the preparation for the national convention, where it received briefing from the Caretaker Chairman, Mai Mala Buni.

speaking on the allegation that the APC governors were the ones frustrating the convention from holding, the Kebbi governor said, “We appreciate that Nigerians are interested in what the APC is doing, because Nigerians gave us their mandate by electing us into offices and holding us to a high standard and we are very conscious of that.

His words: “All the APC governors have met and as always, appreciated the need to work together with other stakeholders. We have always been humble to acknowledge that we are not only stakeholders of the party. To work with other stakeholders and to ensure we deliver transparent, honest national executives that will have the confidence of all party members.”

UK Injects £10m into Nigeria’s Energy Sector,"•Returns £210,000 illegal payment

Michael Olugbode



The United Kingdom has injected £10 million into Nigeria’s low carbon energy project. The concessional aid is aimed at reducing the risks, for pension and insurance funds’ to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria’s COP26 commitments.

UK also signed an agreement with the Nigerian government that would enable a compensation of £210,610 to the country following a successful investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office on the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.

The governments of Nigeria, United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, yesterday, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in a joint commitment to continue the fight against corruption.

The MoU was signed between UK’s Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, and the Attorney General of the Federal and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who was represented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Umar. It sets out the terms and understanding between the governments of the United Kingdom and Nigeria to make the compensation payment.

During the signing of the MoU, Ford said, “The Security and Defence Dialogue held in February 2022 between our two countries reaffirmed both the UK and Nigeria’s commitment to work together to tackle illicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption.

“The UK has a zero tolerance policy to corruption and we hope that today’s signing sends a clear statement about our commitment to this.”

She noted that in a global economy where international trade was vital, it was more important than ever that companies operate with integrity and transparency.

Illicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption have been identified as major hindrances to economic growth, trade, stable governance, and the security of both countries.

The compensation payment from the UK to Nigeria was secured after a four-year corruption investigation led by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK. The money was obtained through a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), which meant the prosecutor agreed to defer prosecution in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements, such as accepting criminal liability for offences and paying the appropriate compensation.

In this case, the DPA was agreed with Amec Foster Wheeler (AFWEL), in relation to the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.

The compensation payment demonstrated that when such crimes were identified, the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) would investigate the companies and, where evidence was found, ensure that they faced appropriate sanctions.

In March 2021, the UK government returned £4.2 million to Nigeria from funds recovered from associates of former Delta State Governor James Ibori.

However, in this case, “The Government of the United Kingdom will transfer the compensation amount in the sum of £210,610 (118.4 million Naira) within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of signing this MOU.

“In both instances, the MoU’s confirm that the Nigerian government has pledged to use the returned funds for projects that will benefit and improve the country.

“The UK will remain committed to returning all illegal assets, no matter the amount, as per the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).”

UK’s Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Lisa Osofsky said, “We have a zero tolerance approach to companies who think they can bribe their way to financial success. Bribery and corruption not only stifle real economic growth and free trade, they also damage democracy and, therefore, risk the security of all our countries.

“I am, of course, delighted that the tenacity of my SFO colleagues has resulted in the people of Nigeria being compensated in a way that will truly benefit them.”

Malami, while thanking the UK for the gesture, promised that the repatriated fund would be expended on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja to Kano road, and the Second Niger Bridge.

On UK’s injection of £10 million of concessional financing alongside InfraCredit to mobilise pension and insurance investments, the statement noted that it would help to reduce the risk for pension and insurance funds to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria’s COP26 commitments.

The financing would also help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, and support off-grid, low-carbon energy projects. Additionally, the £10 million would be blended to de-risk transactions and, therefore, mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors. This would help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.

UK Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, speaking on the investment, said, “The UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth.

“As the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital, which is essential to grow the sector at scale.

“This innovative blended finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.

“This initiative will support the implementation of Nigeria’s Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria’s plans to increase energy access, including the Solar Naija programme.”

On his part, the MD/CEO, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and Chairman of InfraCredit, Uche Orji said:

“InfraCredit is pleased to be working with FCDO to mobilise private investment from domestic pension funds and other institutional investors into such an important developmental area as low carbon energy access.

“This programme is aligned with NSIA’s other clean energy initiatives which aims to deliver up to 250-500MW of renewable energy capacity in Nigeria that will reduce annual CO2 emissions, alleviate poverty, create jobs and support local economic growth.”

Speaking at the announcement, the Minister of State for Power, Mr. Godwin Jedy-Agba, said with the support from the UK Government’s Energy Transition Council showed the pathway to an energised economy and carbon neutrality by 2060. The assistance also highlighted the need for additional investments of $410 billion above business as usual over the next 40 years.

Jedy-Agba stated, “Whereas all efforts have been geared towards unlocking private sector activity in the clean energy transition, one major challenge continues to be private sector access to local currency financing. This is where local institutions such as pension and insurance funds have a key role to play, as only these institutions possess the scale of local currency liquidity required to accelerate the transition.”

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at a meeting with Ford said the federal government looked forward to cooperate with the United Kingdom (UK) in the security of the West African sub-region.

Onyeama received, in audience, the United Kingdom Minister for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. He expressed gratitude to the government of the United Kingdom for its extensive and significant support in diverse areas, stating that the West African sub-region is facing huge security challenges, including governance challenges.

He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had a big hit on the economies of the world and also expressed gratitude to the United Kingdom for support during the period, particularly with vaccines and other support in the area of health.

Onyeama added that the United Kingdom had been involved in the security of the West African sub-region, saying a lot is going on in the sub-region, particularly in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso with the support of the United Nations.

The minister said, “So, we look forward to continue to cooperate with you in this area because we feel that it is not something that we can do alone in the sub-region.

“We need the United Nations’ support and also the support of European countries. We have been engaged and in the framework of the G5 Sahel and other initiatives.”

Speaking further on the specific assistance the United Kingdom planned to render Nigeria, Ford said the UK would be discussing with the Nigerian government how to help in community policing, training and improving the police.

Ford, however, emphasised that the move was a partnership and not the United Kingdom telling Nigeria what to do.

She added, “This was us listening, sharing experiences, especially from the national security areas which we may have seen and experienced both in our country, but also, from what we are seeing across the world and bringing our experiences together.”

"How Top Officials In Attorney-General, Malami's Ministry Of Justice Embezzled N104million, Moved Cash In Bag","A petition to the Independent Corrupt Practice and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has called for a probe into over N104 million which is missing from the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami.

The petition, started by the Integrity and Transparency Watch (ITW), a Nigerian non-profit organisation and society watchdog, urged the ICPC to investigate and prosecute the director of finance and account in the Ministry of Justice, Joshua Luka Kadmi who is in Grade Level 17 and one Abuh Danjuma who also works in the AGF's office.

Abubakar Malami

The petition, dated February 15, 2022, was addressed to the ICPC Chairman, Bolaji Owasanoye by Shaibu Sodangi, the National Coordinator and Head of ITW's Investigation Department.

According to the petition obtained by SaharaReporters, the duo, within two months (November to December 2021), allegedly embezzled N104 million through the private account of Danjuma (UBA Account No: 2064800888 and Access Bank No: 0050341092).

Afterwards, the junior officer, Danjuma reportedly withdrew the money from his bank account and handed it over to Kadmi in a bag.

The ITW noted that the actions of the officers are in breach of the General Regulation Act, stressing that they expended government resources without due process and violated stimulated rules, particularly with reference to sections 12&19 of the corrupt practices and other related offences act, 2000 and punishable under relevance section of the same act.

The group further stated that both Kadmi and Abuh should be made to step aside to allow for a thorough investigation into the issue.

The statement reads: “Established in 2013, The Integrity and Transparency Watch (ITW) is a Nigerian nonprofit with a mission to promote transparency and accountability in the public and private sectors in supporting the effort in developing a Transparency Integrity Index for Federal Ministries, Departments, and Agencies in Nigeria.

“As an independent Civil Society Group and lead researchers, we had unravelled the scam following months of the group’s diligent research team investigation of the issue which became a national embarrassment, to ensure justice is done to the society which norms have been violated by the reckless and corruption driven habit of the director of finance and account in the ministry of Justice Mr Joshua Luka Kadmi of GL 17 and one Abuh Danjuma at GL 9.

“The integrity watch, an Economic and administration Watchdog for the society, we work to promote good governance and quality leadership at the strata of public service.

“We wish to express our displeasure over constant breach of General Regulation Act by leads of a government agency, reckless and fraudulent expending of our

common patrimony for personal enrichment.

“It is highly pitiable and equally worrisome to note that Director of Finance and Account Federal Ministry of Justice Mr. Joshua Kadmi and in connivance with Mr. Abuh Danjuma continues to expend government resources without due process and total disregard to financial law laid down by the government to guide her financial operations which actions continue to cast doubt on the current administration on whether the government is really ready to fight corruption in Nigeria if the Ministry that is supposed to uphold the law 100% are now seen breaching financial Regulation Act. It will mean a total loss of hope for the current administration to fight corruption.

“In the month of November to December 2021, the Director of Finance Mr. Joshua Luka Kadmi and Mr. Abuh Danjuma frittered away millions of naira through a private account of Abuh Danjuma a staff member of the Ministry of Justice, monies into Abuh Danjuma UBA Account No: 2064800888 and Access Bank No: 0050341092 to the sum of N104,842,800.00 (One Hundred and Four Million, Eight Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand, Eight Hundred Naira) repeatedly for the month November and December toward the end of the year where MDAs are asked to return the unspent fund to the government letter.

“The monies paid into a private account of Abuh Danjuma (UBA Account) which was withdrawn and handed over to Mr. Luka through a 'Ghana-must-go' bag on behalf of the Ministry of Justice breached financial regulation act 713 which stated that “personal money shall in no circumstance be paid into a government account, nor shall any public money be paid into a private account, an officer who pays public money into the private account is deemed to have done so with fraudulent intention; and also the Financial Circular Ref No: TRY/A2&B2/20090AGF/CAD/26/V dated 24th March 2009 states that, all accounting officers and officers controlling expenditure are to ensure that all local procurement of stores and services costing above N200,000.00 shall be made only through the award of contract.

“We request ICPC to investigate and prosecute Mr. Joshua Luka Kadmi and Abuh Danjuma in violation of section 12&19 of the corrupt practices and other related offences act, 2000 and punishable under relevance section of the same act.

“That Mr. Joshua and Abuh having contravened the financial act, corrupt practices and other related offences at section 105 of criminal code should as a matter of urgency step aside from the ministry immediately to give room for an unfettered investigation of the commission with compliance with the office of the Accountant General of Federation, return the sum of N104,842,800 into the government’s coffers pending the conclusion of the investigation into the financial crime.

“To this end, we request an immediate investigation into the rot in the ministry of justice on how Mr. Joshua Luka Kadmi and Mr. Abuh Danjuma's fraudulent activity in the ministry of justice which is grave to the nation’s economy at this time of scarcer resources.

“Attached documents obtained with help of freedom of Information ACT through watchdog members in CBN, Federal Ministry of Finance and Accountant General of Federation office justifies our demand for immediate action on fraudulent staff in Attorney General of Federation office.”

BREAKING: Buhari To Sign Amended Electoral Bill In Matter Of Hours – Presidency,"President Muhammadu Buhari will in a matter of hours sign the re-worked Electoral Act Amendment Bill.

The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, disclosed this on Tuesday during an interview on Channels Television.

“He (Buhari) will sign it (the bill) any moment from now,” he said while appearing as a guest on a programme. “It could be today, it could be tomorrow, it could be anytime, but within the 30 days.

“It could be signed today; it could be signed tomorrow. In a matter of hours; not days. Hours could be 24 hours; it could be 48 hours; not days, not weeks.”

There has been condemnation from several quarters over the Buhari presidency’s reluctance to sign the bill.

SaharaReporters on Monday reported that the African Action Congress (AAC) would join protests to press home the demand for the signing.

This had been contained in a statement issued on Monday by Femi Adeyeye, the National Publicity Secretary of the Party.

According to the statement, the protests are necessary considering the abuse the electoral space had suffered under President Muhammadu Buhari administration.","President Muhammadu Buhari will in a matter of hours sign the re-worked Electoral Act Amendment Bill.

Okorocha's absence stalls arraignment in ‘N5.7bn fraud’ case,"A federal high court in Abuja has fixed March 28 for the arraignment of Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, over allegations of fraud.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on January 31, filed a 17-count charge against the former Imo governor before a federal high court in Abuja.

The charge against Okorocha came hours after he formally declared his intention to run for president.

According to the EFCC, the former Imo governor allegedly conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds.

Aside from Okorocha, other defendants are Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited.

When the case was called on Tuesday, the former governor was not in court and he did not have any legal representation.

Cosmos Ugwu, EFCC counsel, told the court that he has been unable to serve court processes on Okorocha.

“We have made several efforts to serve him with the charge but we have been unable to effect service,” he said.

Ugwu asked the court for an adjournment to enable him to effect service on the former governor.

All other defendants were present and had legal representation in court.

Inyang Ekwo, the judge, adjourned the matter to March 28 for arraignment.

After the fresh charge was filed in court, Okorocha said he had visited President Muhammadu Buhari to seek his intervention over the action of the EFCC.

Stephen Pam, judge of a federal high court in Rivers state, had on February 8, reinstated his earlier order made on December 6, 2021, which asked the EFCC to stop the prosecution of Okorocha.

The court had also prohibited the EFCC from investigating or carrying out any other action against the former governor while asking the anti-graft agency to release his passport and any other travel documents.","A federal high court in Abuja has fixed March 28 for the arraignment of Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, over allegations of fraud.

Oil prices near $100 a barrel amid Russia-Ukraine crisis,"Global oil prices trade near $100 per barrel on supply disruption worries as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated.

The latest price is above the oil benchmark of $62/barrel in Nigeria’s 2022 budget.

The development is coming after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

Brent crude futures rose 3.82%, to $99.03 a barrel at 09:10 GMT+1 on Tuesday, the highest since August 1, 2014.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped $4.79% to $95.86 a barrel versus Friday’s settlement.

On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognising the independence of the Moscow-backed regions, fueling fears of supply shocks in the commodity markets.

The decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow’s official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine — the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic (DPR and LPR).

The decrees recognised them as independent states and guaranteed their security with Russian troops. The decrees also said the Russian peacekeeping forces would be deployed in the regions.

Following the decrees, the White House said President Joe Biden would issue an executive order “that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in” the two Ukrainian regions under the control of Russian-backed separatists.

The rise in global crude oil prices should portend an upturn for Nigeria’s revenue — but payments for price shortfall may take up N2.6 trillion this year.

In December 2021, subsidy payment gulped N270 billion, amounting to N1.43 trillion in annual expense, shrinking revenue accrued to the federation account.","Global oil prices trade near $100 per barrel on supply disruption worries as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated.

Court rules: Unmarried female police officers shouldn't get pregnant,"A federal high court in Abuja has dismissed a suit by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) seeking to invalidate some provisions in the Nigeria Police Force Regulations (NPFR) which forbid unmarried female police officers from getting pregnant.

The Nigerian Bar Association had approached the court to challenge the legality of regulation 127 of the NPFR, arguing that the said provision contradicts the 1999 constitution and is discriminatory to unmarried female police officers.

The regulation, provides that “an unmarried woman police officer, who becomes pregnant, shall be discharged from the Force and shall not be re-enlisted except with the approval of the inspector-general of police”.

Citing the instance of Omolola Olajide, a female police officer who was fired on January 26, 2021, in Ekiti state for becoming pregnant while unmarried, NBA said such discriminatory regulations have made many female officers childless for fear of being fired.

“The male police officers and married female police officers in the Nigeria Police Force are not subjected to similar discrimination, sanction, opprobrium and indignity,” the association said.

“There are many unmarried female police officers in the NPF who, because of this discriminatory practice, cannot have or be allowed to have children because of fear of dismissal from the Police Force.

“Married female police officers are allowed to be pregnant and have children while still serving in the Police Force; they also enjoy maternity benefits.”

Advertisement

The attorney-general of the federation, the Police Service Commission and the Nigeria Police Force were the defendants in the suit.

In a counter-affidavit, the AGF asked the court to dismiss the suit.

The AGF said the plaintiff (NBA) ought to approach the national assembly for an amendment if it was not comfortable with the provision.

“Fundamental human rights, as guaranteed under the 1999 Constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria (as amended), are not absolute,” the AGF submitted.

“The Nigeria Police Act and Regulations are special creations of law. The Nigeria Police Act and Regulations provide the framework for the police force in maintaining peace, combating crime, protecting liberties, life and property and other related matters.

“Lawful discrimination permits an action undertaken based on the irreversible needs of a person or the society at large. The work of law enforcement and policing is one that demands emotional stability and physical agility.

“Effective law enforcement requires the performance of essential functions which are strongly contingent upon a high level of physical fitness. Environmental conditions of policing and law enforcement can create potential conflicts between police duties and pregnancy.”

Delivering judgment on Monday, Inyang Ekwo, the judge, agreed with the AGF’s submission.

He said the suit lacked merit, holding that such unmarried female police officers were aware of the regulation before they joined the force.

“Where a law or regulation of an establishment identifies gender attributes or faults and seeks to regulate the vulnerabilities capable of negatively affecting the progress of such gender, such law or regulation is a warning aforehand and cannot be said to be discriminatory,” Ekwo held.

Advertisement

“In my opinion, the essence of this suit is to use the provision of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, to lower the morale and professional standard of the NPF and this court will not give its imprimatur to such venture.

“It is my finding that in all that the plaintiff has posited, it has not pointed to any aspect of the regulation complained of, which violates the interest of public order or public morality, which will make it reasonably justifiable to invalidate Regulation 127 of the NPFR and I so hold.

“I find that there was no basis for this action in the first place. An unmarried woman who intends to get pregnant is not compelled to join the police.

“Where such a woman becomes a police officer, she is bound by the regulation on pregnancy while being unmarried.

“I am unable to see any of the fundamental human rights provided in Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, expressly or latently meant to shield an unmarried woman police officer who becomes pregnant from being discharged from the force.

“I find that the regulation in issue, in this case, is about conduct and nothing more. I find no compelling reason for this court to disrupt the discipline of the force or interfere in the regulation of the conduct of officers of the NPF, whether male or female.

“Any person who joins the force must abide by the regulation of the force or not join the force as there is no compulsion about its membership.

“It is my opinion that Regulation 127 of the NPFR is to be seen as a code of conduct for an unmarried woman police officer and to forewarn such officer on the consequence of becoming pregnant while being unmarried in the force.

“However, the regulation provides for a remedy after such officer has been discharged from the force, by stating that such officer can be relisted with the approval of the IGP.

“The argument that this provision is discriminatory because it does not apply to male officers, in my opinion, goes beyond the bounds of reasonableness and tilts seriously towards the absurd.”","A federal high court in Abuja has dismissed a suit by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) seeking to invalidate some provisions in the Nigeria Police Force Regulations (NPFR) which forbid unmarried female police officers from getting pregnant.

AfricaWorks’ ambition transcends being a coworking space,"The air changes the moment you step into AfricanWorks’ compound in Victoria Island, one of the highbrow areas in Lagos, Nigeria. The first thing you see are the greeneries all over the compound, the atmosphere is calm and quiet. It feels like you’ve just escaped the hustle and bustle of Lagos.

As you’d expect, the outdoor experience is a hint of what goes on in the interior.

The main door is see-through so you can tell of the comfort that awaits inside. After a minute in the lobby, Gregoire Schwebig, founder and CEO of AfricaWorks came out to meet me. He’s of average height and moderately built. His energy, however, didn’t feel like that of a man who had just completed a trip from Paris to Lagos that morning. As we exchanged pleasantries, one question lingered; why is this French man building a home-grown business in Africa?

Schwebig was born and grew up in Paris with a close tie to Francophone Africa. His mother was born in Senegal, so he visited Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali and Togo while growing up. After graduating from ESSEC Business School, one of the best business schools in Europe, he went on to work at Lehman Brothers in London as a financial analyst. After Lehman Brothers liquidated, he joined Societe Generale in Hong Kong.

In 2011, Schwebig joined Fanasi Capital, a venture capital fund focused on high-growth startups in East Africa, as a senior associate, and then moved to Kenya and remained there for 8 years. He was elected as a consular adviser to the French government on the affairs of 7 countries in East and South Africa. In 2016, he became the president of the Kenya chapter of the French Chamber of Commerce, a dedicated body that helps French companies and entrepreneurs set up in Kenya.

Schwebig wore many hats during his time in Kenya; in 2014, he started Haussmann Africa, a corporate real estate company that built and designed custom offices for companies. The company, which he still runs till date, has designed offices for Uber, L’oreal and Total.

After designing offices for a while, he realised there were gaps he wanted to fill, so in 2019, he started AfricaWorks.

AfricaWorks in Abidjan

Building AfricaWorks

The way people work had already started shifting before the pandemic hit in 2020. The pandemic only expedited the shift and forced businesses to restructure work to fit the new normal which is hybrid.

While there was already full-blown support for the future of work in the West, there was little or no solution in Africa to support the growing business ecosystem—there was no real pan-African flexible workplace solution that could power the future of work across the continent. And here is where AfricanWorks, a pan-African flexible workspace provider chain, plugs itself.

The idea was simple: build a world-class workspace that brings together the best businesses under one roof in one city. Then scale and replicate the process in another. AfricaWorks launched its first space in Abidjan, the capital city of Ivory Coast, and now operates in 9 cities and counting—Abidjan, Accra, Cairo, Cape Town, Dakar, Dar Es Salaam, Jo’burg, Lagos, and Nairobi—across 8 countries.

AfricaWorks in Cape Town

The company lists top multinationals like Glovo, Universal Music, L’oreal, Total and more as part of companies working out of its spaces.

“We currently have over 150 businesses and over 2,000 individuals working from our spaces. We are also opening more spaces in the coming months,” Schwebig told TechCabal.

More than just a coworking space

For AfricaWorks, as the African tech and business ecosystem grows, it will continue to grow to support them across the continent. Beyond being a pan-African coworking space, it now wants to do more as it slowly transitions into a tech company. It has started building a business-to-business (B2B) product that will provide full-on operation support for its clients.

“Our B2B service marketplace will be called AfricaWorks Services, which will help us connect our clients to partnered services providers like recruiting, marketing, finance, expansion, and everything else they need to grow their businesses,” said Schwebig, who also co-founded French-African Foundation, an organisation that contributes to the emergence of a Franco-African succession.

Schwebig with the Afriworks Lagos team

The play here is to reduce third party friction and be the only direct partner their members need. AfricaWorks Services will partner with talent companies like OfferZen and Andela to bring qualified talent to its member companies; partner with marketing and financial firms to bring quality marketing and financial services to its community; and African tradetech like Norebase to help in expansion and manage trade across Africa.

Schwebig believes that Africa will play a pivotal role in the future of work and they [AfricanWorks] are positioning to be a crucial part of that movement. He believes this is becoming evident in the way the African tech ecosystem is booming and the surge in talent exodus. AfricaWorks wants to play in the talent services but first for its members and then—maybe in the future—expanding the services to the public.

AfricaWorks operates in 9 cities and counting and these countries, though they may have similar problems, have a peculiar business landscape that requires a bespoke solution. Schwebig confirmed that, while Ivory Coast remains AfricaWorks’ biggest market in terms of patronage and revenue, it has invested more in Nigeria due to the size of the market and the prospect of the tech ecosystem, especially.

Among other places, the company is also planning to open new space at the Kotoka international airport in Accra, Ghana.

According to Goldie Iyamu, the marketing head at AfricaWorks, by the time all the pending projects are completed, the company should push into 500 businesses and over 3,000 people working across their spaces.

After 2 years and 6 months, AfricaWorks has experienced astronomical growth and now it’s positioning itself as the partner for businesses with pan-African growth ambitions.

A virtual art gallery in DRC connects local artists with global clients,"The destruction of patronage networks and the subsequent isolation of African art and artists during colonialism and early independence are things of the past for a group of artists who have leapfrogged their way into living rooms and boardrooms across the world.

This article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle of bird Story Agency

Huddled in a tiny office, young workers are neatly wrapping up canvases, ready for shipment. The silence in the room is loud — only interrupted by an occasional sigh, heavy breathing, or a cough. At the far end of the room, a young man is multitasking— his fingers hammering at the buttons of a laptop, while he chats on a smartphone. An air of urgency hangs in the room and he, like the rest of the team, seems pressed for time.

In an age that welcomes and pays for digitally-signed images of all types, and in which vast volumes of clothing chosen from digital catalogues traverse the world, it is perhaps not surprising that digital manifestations of art are giving artists ready markets all over the world. What might surprise many is that this system of digitally marketed, paid-for, and delivered artworks is flourishing here in Kinshasa.

Welcome to the engine room of Bandombe Galerie, a virtual art gallery that is the brainchild of Sisqo Ndombe. Bandombe showcases and connects contemporary African artists with potential clients, globally.

“A majority of African artists do not manage to make a living from their creations because there are not enough channels dedicated to their promotion,” Ndombe explained.

That’s where Bandombe comes in, attracting potential buyers, connecting them with artists, and then providing the platform for negotiation, payment, and delivery of the creative works.

“As an artist, if you don’t have a place where you can show your work to an audience, you shall never succeed,” Ndombe added.

Where traditional art galleries prefer working with acclaimed artists and often shun aspiring and unknown creators – often simply because a gallery only has so much space – Ndombe felt he could solve this problem on a digital level. As the idea began to crystallise, his “eureka” moment struck… he could leverage the internet to not only showcase unknown talent – including his own – but also to market and sell top African art, globally.

“I remember the time when I had to reach out to galleries, walking long distances carrying my canvases, trying to find some buyers. I couldn’t afford to do things that way anymore,” he says as he recalls his journey as an artist.

The power of the internet has been a game-changer not just for him, but many more artists, who have signed up to his network across Africa.

With limited finances, the start was going to be a struggle. However, from his wages as a graphic designer in a local company, he managed to save some money and through constant sacrifice, his dream began to unfold.

“In 2018, Bandombe Galerie, website: bandombe.com, went up online,” he said.

As the idea to sell more than just his own art evolved, he onboarded other artists. Some were reluctant but Ndombe is nothing if not persuasive and he managed to convince enough of his fellow artists to sign on with the platform. Where there was reluctance at home, artists from other African countries jumped at the opportunity.

“I thought my fellow Congolese would be the first to jump in, but that didn’t happen. However, when they saw that artists from other countries were packing the platform, they started to join in,” he said.

At first, it was not easy to get buyers to trust the concept or the platform, but Ndombe’s never-say-die spirit kept the project focused on his goal — to attract buyers with unique artworks.

“What is instrumental to attract art lovers and buyers on our platform is to have a good selection of displayed works,” he explained.

It took the team eight months of anxiety, patience, and sacrifice before selling their first piece.

“Our first client was a European woman. She had been working in Congo for a couple of years, and now she was leaving the country. She wanted to take some art piece from Congo with her as a souvenir,” Ndombe recalled.

In the four years since, the Kinshasa-based virtual gallery Bandombe Galerie has grown in leaps and bounds across Africa making it one of, if not, the, most popular virtual galleries for patrons of African art launched on the continent. Currently, it has 800 registered artists from 30 African countries and more than 3,000 artworks in its catalogue.

Looking back at its journey of the gallery, Ndombe said that what started as a small idea to address his dilemma is now helping some aspiring artists to emerge and gain visibility among art collectors far beyond the borders of their countries and continent.

“It has given access to many African artists and their works to a wider audience and market,” he said.

One of those who bought up into Ndombe’s virtual gallery initiative is Rwanda-based painter, Izere Antoine.

“Bandombe is very supportive of the up-and-coming talents and African art in general,” said Izere.

Izere said through the virtual gallery, he has found buyers for three of his paintings. And above all, beyond the visitations and inquiries, Bandombe has transformed his life and equipped him with tech skills to digitally market his works and brand himself.

“Mostly it also encouraged me to be more in online marketing like websites and more,” he said.

Nigerian artist Onofua Dennis, who has also signed on with Bandombe talks glowingly of the virtual gallery.

“Their marketing competency, their capacity in dispensing durable relationships between artists, collectors, and as well as the gallery team through communication, packaging, and delivery of artworks are great,” he said.

Particularly, Onofua praises Bandombe’s payments policy and logistics management which he says have been key in building that durable relationship between all artists and clients.

“Percentage of payment due to the artist is being attended to within a short period of time. More so, I have seen fantastic reports of buyers – delivered publicly – about the receiving of their package,” he added.

When asked if Bandombe has been helpful in helping him obtain more artistic recognition, he quickly cuts in: “Well, yes”, adding that; “To date, we have sold more than 214 pieces… and that is remarkable”.

For Ndombe, the growth and future success of Bandombe Galerie mean more work and a commitment to growing his client base.

He is also determined to end the current trend in which the global emergence of contemporary African art is being driven mainly by non-African buyers, instead of by a local market.

“It’s important to sensitise our people to consume more art. We envisage the opening of a showroom and the organisation of art fairs across the continent.

“The potential is huge for Africa arts, and a bright future is beckoning those with the courage to embrace the infinite opportunities offered by technology to shine on the global stage,” he concluded, signing off on another deal with a remote patron.

Women-focused credit facility and Africa’s developer ecosystem,"Share this article:













Hello!

Statistically, Mondays are often the busiest day of the week, work-wise, for various reasons like giving status updates of the previous week, defining tasks for the new week, and generally making sure to start the week on a positive note.

So, what do we do on Tuesdays? A school of thought has it that Tuesdays are the most productive days of the week. Do you plan to make it so?

But again, why should I tell you what to do with your day? For me, while I work, I’ll probably think about legal ways to have fun on my birthday (tomorrow) without leaving the house.

Before then, these are what I’m discussing today:

Credit facility for African women entrepreneurs

716,000 African developers and counting

What’s up with the new features on your favourite apps?

A quick one. In the late hours of yesterday, a Bloomberg article headlined, “Nigerian fintech company Tingo is seeking $500 million to expand across Africa” threw the Nigerian tech Twitter into an uproar. Some concerns were raised concerning the numbers claimed by the company.

There’s the question of how a Nigerian-founded fintech company with millions of users, founded over two decades ago, recorded $594 million in revenue plus $212 million EBITDA in 2020, and valued at $6.3 billion barely made the news? Well, the company got a feature on Techpoint in 2019. Still, trust us to do some more digging.

UK’s CDC X FirstBank for women entrepreneurs















A couple of African startups and venture capital firms are in the United Kingdom’s development finance arm, CDC Group’s portfolio. Recall Ghana’s mPharma and TLcom’s raises. A few months back, the institution also committed $50.9 million to support Africa’s digital infrastructure. There’s a new development.

Yesterday, it announced backing Nigeria’s first commercial bank, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd, with a $100 million credit facility to support women entrepreneurs and SMEs in the country. Of this amount, a minimum of $30 million will go into credit lines for women-owned and led businesses.

The Group’s intention with this deal is to empower women in business, promote social and financial inclusion, and alleviate poverty. The credit facility will be disbursed through the bank’s over 700 branches and 150,000 agents across the country.

How will FirstBank leverage this deal? Ordinarily, SMEs are less likely to get bank loans like large firms, but there’s been a paradigm shift with the onset of digital banks and lending platforms. Traditional banks are also not left behind.

While FirstBank is yet to issue an official comment on how to disburse the funds, there’s a possibility of it going into existing SME-focused product financing options accessible to FirstSME account holders and other users. Want to be a part of this? Maybe this could help.

716,000 African developers and counting















For the second consecutive year, Google has published the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, based on a study conducted across 16 sub-Saharan African markets — including Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda — surveying software developers and local tech experts.

The findings show an all-time increase in demand for African developers globally and over 2.5x growth in VC funding, all of which happened despite the challenge that came with the pandemic.

The report also highlighted the role of Nigeria in this growth, evidenced by how Nigeria’s developer ecosystem alone added about 5,000 new professional developers to its pool in 2021.

In the coming days, look out for informed articles drawn from these findings and more on Techpoint Africa.

How kindly do you take to these features?















In May 2021, Twitter introduced Tip Jar to the app to allow people to get paid for tweeting through third-party payment services. The feature was rolled out to more users in September. Given the feature’s initial use case, we were quite optimistic about how it could encourage everyday bitcoin transactions.

Twitter’s new tipping feature could make spending Bitcoin attractive

Subsequently, the microblogging platform allowed users to add their Ethereum wallets to receive tips. For now, Tips can be in the form of money, Bitcoin, and ETH.

And in the past week, it announced that the payment feature now supports African payments platforms, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and Paga, making this service easier to use by users in African countries where the Tips feature is available, like Nigeria and Ghana. By the way, the function has always supported PayPal and other payments platforms like Bandcamp and Patreon, commonly used by creatives.

Bottom line: when next you’re happy with your favourite creator’s tweet or ‘hot takes’ on Twitter Spaces, don’t forget to tip them a ‘little something’. You no longer have to be discouraged by the hassles of sending via PayPal.

Moving on…

In July 2021, the global streaming company, Netflix, intended to foray into video games. And it did! By November, every subscriber had access. There are currently a dozen games on the platform, but it started with five games, some of which are interactive games based on popular shows.

It’s probably too early to know if Netflix’s bet is worth it. But, I’m curious about the feature’s prospect in driving subscriptions so far.

Oil surges near $100 but Nigeria is not at the party,"Oil surges near $100 but Nigeria is not at the party

Oil and gas prices are climbing on fears that the Ukraine-Russia crisis will disrupt supplies across the world but Nigeria and its economy remain unimpacted, thanks to years of poor spending.

The price of Brent crude, an international benchmark, reached a seven-year high of $99.38 a barrel on Tuesday but previous rallies have not added to FX reserves or helped the Naira.

Russia ordered troops into two rebel-held regions in Ukraine’s east after it recognised them as independent states.

In London, the FTSE 100 share index opened more than 1.4% lower before regaining some ground.

Asian stock markets closed lower, and US stock exchanges were braced for losses.

The UK and several western allies have threatened sanctions on Russia, which is the second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. Russia is also the world’s top producer of natural gas.

Russia has said its troops will engage in “peacekeeping” in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics.

But the US has said calling them peacekeepers is “nonsense”, and that Russia is creating a pretext for war.

The Ukraine-Russia crisis could have “substantial implications” on oil prices, which have jumped more than 10% since the start of the month, said Sue Trinh of Manulife Investment Management.

Sanctions forcing Russia to supply less crude or natural gas would have an “important impact on the global economy”, she added.

Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International, said oil could go above $100 per barrel due to a combination of the Ukraine crisis, cold winter in the US, and a lack of investment in oil and gas supplies around the world.

“Russia accounts for one in every 10 barrels of oil consumed globally, so it is a major player when it comes to the price of oil, and of course, it’s really going to hurt consumers at the petrol pumps,” she said.

There have been US and EU sanctions on Russia for a number of years, which has had a “massive impact” on the Russian economy.

Sanctions are likely to be “deepened”, Ms Currie said, including sanctions on financial institutions, technology such as chips, and individuals.

Most of the oil and gas that the UK imports do not come from Russia, but if Russian supplies are constricted, wholesale prices are likely to rise around the world.

This could drive up already high inflation rates in the UK and elsewhere, economists said.","Oil surges near $100 but Nigeria is not at the partyOil and gas prices are climbing on fears that the Ukraine-Russia crisis will disrupt supplies across the world but Nigeria and its economy remain unimpacted, thanks to years of poor spending.

Vaccine production seen helping Nigeria beyond COVID,"Nigeria’s bid to establish its own COVID-19 vaccine production plant could serve as a catalyst to research and produce vaccines for other endemic diseases beyond the current needs of the pandemic, analysts have said.

It could become re-purposed to fight other life-threatening infectious diseases that require immunisation, such as poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, measles, cholera, hepatitis B and yellow fever, among others.

“There are some diseases we have in Africa which nobody is interested in because it doesn’t affect them overseas. This will be a great opportunity to research into those ones and create vaccines that are specific for our own environment,” Oyewale Tomori, the chairman of Biovaccines Nigeria Limited (BNL), a company at the helm of current plans to establish the plant in Ota, Ogun State, tells BusinessDay.

“To me, that’s even the more interesting thing about that because it then opens the opportunity for us to look at older vaccines and improve on them, and also generate new ones,” he says.

Nigeria finally got a foot in the door in its long journey to local production for the first time since talks about getting Africa to its vaccine needs began.

It made the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) list of first six countries in Africa to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA-based vaccines, after failing to qualify for some major partnership deals that saw countries like South Africa and Egypt top destinations of choice for the production of COVID-19 vaccine and pills.

But the demand for COVID-19 vaccine in the country might have thinned out or become inconsequential by the time the vaccine plant comes on stream or gets ripe enough to adopt this technology. The project, to cost $51 million, is estimated to span between five and seven years.

With dwindling infection rates in the country and rising relaxation of restrictions in some worst-hit countries, there are speculations that the COVID-19 pandemic could be nearing an end or inching towards an endemic status.

The government last year announced it was in talks with the International Finance Corporation and other lenders to raise about N12.3 billion ($30m) to help finance a vaccine plant, and it seems to be walking that talk.

Tomori says the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) provided the information and linkage to WHO’s plan to set up a COVID-19 mRNA technology hub in Africa.

BNL provided the technical details, completed and submitted the application while officials of the Ministry of Health led by Osagie Ehanire, the health minister, handled the diplomatic visits and shuttles required. And of many applications, Nigeria was chosen.

“It is a step forward in the efforts to produce vaccines locally, based on current mRNA technology. It also means when we decide to collaborate and contribute at the level and within the space of our competence, we will succeed,” Tomori, a retired professor of virology, states.

The disappointment in failing to invest in a responsive structure for vaccine production grew worse as the pandemic went on with Nigeria queuing behind the priorities of foreign producers for vaccines.

When Pfizer and Merck, both US multinational pharmaceutical firms, were looking to partner to localise production in Africa, for instance, Nigeria couldn’t compete due to a dearth of capacity, regulatory compliance, and the ability to meet international standards for quality-assured medicines.

Experts see part of that changing with this new development, despite the uncertainty of when it will materialise.

President Muhammadu Buhari in a statement last Friday urged the European Union (EU) to support the World Trade Organisation (WTO) towards the conclusion of negotiations on intellectual property rights’ waiver to ensure that the manufacturing of vaccines can start early in Africa.

According to Buhari, his government will prioritise the manufacturing of vaccines as well as the sharing and transfer of technology, speaking during the 6th Europe-Africa Summit.

How mRNA works

The messenger RNA is a sequence of genetic code that tells cells what proteins to build so that they can function.

To produce, scientists develop a synthetic version of some of the virus, inject it into the human body cells to read it as an instruction to start building the proteins, including COVID-19’s distinctive ‘spike’ protein.

The body then mounts an immune response by producing antibodies to fight the virus proteins made by our cells. This prepares the immune system to fight the real virus when encountered later on.

It is different from the way some other vaccines work, where a small part of the virus itself, or the whole virus (weakened or dead), is injected into the body to trigger an immune response.

WHO established the global mRNA technology transfer hub last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

Primarily set up to address the COVID-19 emergency, the hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other products as well.

Depending on the infrastructure, workforce and clinical research and regulatory capacity in place, WHO and partners will work with the beneficiary countries to develop a roadmap and put in place the necessary training and support so that they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.","Nigeria’s bid to establish its own COVID-19 vaccine production plant could serve as a catalyst to research and produce vaccines for other endemic diseases beyond the current needs of the pandemic, analysts have said.

"Overnight rate shoots up on FX, bond auction, CRR debit","Overnight interbank rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight lending, increased to 14 percent on Friday from 0.5 percent the previous day, due to effect of foreign exchange (FX), bond auction and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) debit, which affected the level of liquidity in the financial market.

The Open Repo (OPR) rate, a short-term agreement to sell securities in order to buy them back at a slightly higher price, increased by 12.25 percent to close at 13 percent compared to 0.75 percent on the previous day.

However, at the close of market on Monday, the Overnight rate decreased by 1.33 percent to close at 12.67 percent as against the last Friday close of 14 percent, and the Open Repo (rate decreased by 1 percent to close at 12 percent compared with 13 percent on Friday.

Approximately N113 billion was withdrawn from the system on Friday by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) via CRR debits from the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs).

The financial market saw N305 billion withdrawn from the system, for the settlement of Wednesday’s bond auction.

“With the market also settling Friday’s retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) auction alongside other outflows, rates jumped from trading around 0.5 percent yesterday, to trade between 14 percent and 17 percent in the market today (Friday),” Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, told BusinessDay.

Rates are however expected to moderate next week, on the back of reduced funding pressures, he said on Friday.

The Nigerian treasury bills (NT-Bills) secondary market closed on a flat note with average yield across the curve remaining unchanged at 4.19 percent. Average yields across short-term, medium-term, and long-term maturities remained unchanged at 3.39 percent, 4.24 percent, and 4.93 percent, respectively, a report from FSDH stated.

In the Open Market Operation (OMO) bills market, the average yield across the curve decreased by 2bps to close at 5.28 percent as against the last close of 5.30 percent. Average yield across the long-term maturities declined by 4bps.

However, the average yield across the short-term maturities remained unchanged at 5.41 percent.

OMO with 16-August-22 (-7bps) maturity bill witnessed mild buying interest. The CBN held an OMO auction on February 17, selling bills worth N60.00 billion across the 96-day (N10bn), 187-day (N10bn), and 362-day (N40bn) tenors with the stop rates remaining unchanged at 7 percent, 8.50 percent, and 10.10 percent, respectively.

The auction was oversubscribed, indicating a subscription level of 644 percent (N386.69bn). Demand was skewed towards long tenor maturity bills with bid-to-cover ratios settling at 3.63x (96-day), 5.67x (187-day), and 7.34x (362-day).

A report by Parthian Partners, Africa’s premier inter-dealer broker, indicated that the treasury bills market saw slight demand across the mid to long end with a couple of trades passing through, especially on the longer end. Demand for Special bill papers was notable with a handful of trades done as offers were scarce.

Buy interests across the curve closed the week in the bond market, activity was mostly on the short to mid-end as players went bargain hunting. Few trades were consummated on the day with most activity recorded on the 26s and 34s.

Ola Oladele, vice president, global market, Parthian Partners, explained that the drastic movement in interbank rates this week was driven by liquidity events.

Earlier in the week, the interbank market was awash with liquidity due to OMO maturity of about N136 billion, CBN intervention for some states salaries (estimated at N80-N100bn) and retail SMIS auction refund of about N250 billion, but on Friday overnight rates spiked due to bond auction debit of N305 billion, CRR debit of about N100 billion and an undisclosed amount provided banks as provision for retail FX sales by the CBN.","Overnight interbank rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight lending, increased to 14 percent on Friday from 0.5 percent the previous day, due to effect of foreign exchange (FX), bond auction and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) debit, which affected the level of liquidity in the financial market.
The financial market saw N305 billion withdrawn from the system, for the settlement of Wednesday’s bond auction.
The Nigerian treasury bills (NT-Bills) secondary market closed on a flat note with average yield across the curve remaining unchanged at 4.19 percent.
Average yield across the long-term maturities declined by 4bps.

BENIN CITY – The Leadership and members of NBM of Africa Worldwide, Benin Zone, have congratulated the Benin Monarch, His Royal Majesty, Omo N’Oba N’Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, on the return of two looted Benin artifacts; bronze Cockerel (Okpa) and Uhunwun-alao (Head of Oba) by the Jesuit College of the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen, Scotland to the Oba of Benin.

Recall that the bronze cockerel and head of Oba valued at £2.5m were handed over to the Monarch on Saturday at his palace by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Mr. Tunji Ishola, on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, 125 years after they were looted from the Oba palace, during the 1897 Benin punitive expedition.

The Benin Zone, NBM of Africa, in a statement issued by its Public Relations Officer (PRO), Comrade Idahosa Moses, on behalf of the President, Benin Zone, said that members of the movement heartily commended President Buhari and Oba Ewuare II for ensuring that the artifacts were returned safely to the Oba palace, where they were looted.

The statement read in part: “It is with great joy and delight that, we members of the NBM Benin Zone congratulate His Royal Majesty, Omo N’Oba N’Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II and the people of the Great Benin Kingdom on the return of two Benin artifacts (bronze Cockerel and head of Oba) by Jesuit College, Cambridge University and University of Aberdeen, Scotland.

“No doubt, the arrival of the two artifacts is not only historic and symbolic but has also further expanded the splendor of other artifacts in the palace, and we pray for the urgent return of over 10, 000 other Benin looted artifacts currently domiciled in over 145 Museums across Europe and the US.

“This remarkable event is indeed an auspicious and timely blessing to humanity as we continue to celebrate His Majesty’s reign with all the remarkable achievements since His ascension to the ancient throne of his forebears.

“We call on other institutions and authorities holding unto other looted Benin artifacts to emulate the kind and noble gesture of Jesuit College of Cambridge University, and the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and return Benin artifacts in their possession, as it will be deservice to black-race and humanity at large if the artifacts are not returned to the Oba Palace, their original abode.

“May God bless and keep safe His Royal Majesty and grant him good health, happiness, more wisdom and long life, Oba Gha Tokpere, Isee!!!”.

The Zonal PRO averred that the Benin artifacts transcend beyond mere artworks, as they are symbols of traditional heritage of the Great Benin Kingdom which must not be allowed to be domiciled outside the palace of the Oba.

He extolled the pragmatic efforts and innate diplomatic acumen of the Benin monarch in sustaining the development of the culture and tradition of the people, saying the Benin Kingdom has experienced tremendous transmogrification that has returned the kingdom to its place of pride as the cultural and traditional hub of the black race.

It is worthy of note that the NBM of Africa Worldwide, a Pan-African Organisation, rooted in Pan-African principles and ideology, has been transformed, over the years, into a distinguished organization, as Neo-blackism constitutes a combination of radical intellectualism and Pan-African ideals, which seek to advocate for the rights of Africans globally, and sustainable development of the continent.

Int’l Mother Language Day: Obaseki tasks youths on innovations to preserve indigenous languages – Nigerian Observer,"Share Facebook

BENIN CITY – The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged more young people to join the global effort in preserving endangered indigenous languages by coming up with innovative ideas and developing new technologies to address the global concern.

Obaseki gave the charge in commemoration of this year’s International Mother Language Day marked by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its partner organizations with the theme, “Using technology for multilingual learning: Challenges and opportunities.”

The governor, who described languages as indispensable in propagating Nigeria’s rich cultural heritage and values, urged for increased collaboration among stakeholders to protect the country’s indigenous languages from extinction.

According to him, “This year’s International Mother Language Day is yet another opportunity to draw attention to the need to strengthen efforts at preserving and protecting our local languages from extinction, considering its huge implications on maintaining cultural diversity.

“While linguists, communicators, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) professionals and other global stakeholders intensify efforts at addressing this global concern, the youths must now unleash their digital fluency, creative thinking, and problem-solving skills to provide innovative solutions to the problem of languages going into extinction, which poses a serious threat to cultural diversity and multilingualism.”

“We must leverage technology and the innovative potentials of our young people to advance multilingual education and support the development of quality teaching and learning for all,” the governor added.

Obaseki further stated, “As a government, we have taken deliberate steps to ensure that we preserve our local languages and will sustain these efforts by ensuring that dedicated teachers for languages are provided for across schools in the state through our Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme, which has now been expanded to accommodate all levels of learning in the state.

In a message, UNESCO Director-General, Audrey Azoulay said, “Technology can provide new tools for protecting linguistic diversity. Such tools, for example, facilitating their spread and analysis, allow us to record and preserve languages that sometimes exist only in oral form. Put simply, they make local dialects a shared heritage. However, because the Internet poses a risk of linguistic uniformization, we must also be aware that technological progress will serve plurilingualism only as long as we make the effort to ensure that it does.”

COVID-19: U.S Govt collaborates with Imo State to scale up vaccination,"The United States has reiterated its commitment to support Nigeria and other countries around the world in addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, who stated this in her opening remarks at the Flag-Off of the COVID-19 Mass Vaccination Campaign in Imo State hosted by Governor Hope Uzodinma, shared the United States Global Action plan to help coordinate areas that the world has identified as the most significant barriers to ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

The campaign will increase COVID-19 vaccine access and uptake amongst the people of Imo State.

Ambassador Leonard noted that the U.S. has recommitted increasing access to vaccines, boosting vaccine confidence by tackling misinformation, improving last-mile vaccine delivery, and supporting health workers to vaccinate people. “Part of this commitment is reflected in the U.S. donation of over 21.8 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, accounting for over 35 percent of the total donations to Nigeria.”

The United States Government’s commitment is reflected in the technical and logistics support to ensure vaccines get to all citizens who need them the most. U.S. assistance also focuses on getting vaccines into arms so that no vaccines expire unnecessarily when millions of people need them. “No one is safe from the pandemic until everyone is safe, and the only way to do that is through safe and effective vaccines,” she added.

Ambassador Leonard used the opportunity to recognize the efforts of the U.S. -CDC, USAID, and the U.S. Department of Defense Walter Reed Army Program for their support to Nigeria’s vaccine rollout.

In addition, she thanked U.S. CDC’s implementing partner, the Catholic Caritas Foundation of Nigeria (CCFN), for their pivotal role in ramping up vaccine access and uptake in Imo and other states.

She commended Governor Uzodinma for his efforts to make the vaccines available. She encouraged all those eligible to come out and get vaccinated to secure the health and wellbeing of the Imo people.

She called on community leaders and other gatekeepers to join hands with the government to safeguard the people’s health in the State. “We need your support to champion the vaccination of the people of Imo and protect them from COVID-19. The U.S. Mission in Nigeria stands with you.”

Imo State is currently one of the states in Nigeria with the lowest vaccine uptake. Recent data ranks Imo as 35 out of 36 states (and the FCT) with only 2.3 percent coverage for COVID 19 vaccinations.

The flag-off mass vaccination campaign event serves to accelerate and expand COVID-19 vaccination access and uptake. U.S. – CDC, through PEPFAR American Rescue Plan Act funding and its implementing partner, Catholic Caritas Foundation of Nigeria, are at the forefront of providing that support to all the citizens of Imo State.

Through PEPFAR, US CDC supports over 83% of the estimated people living with HIV in Imo state with comprehensive treatment services.","The United States has reiterated its commitment to support Nigeria and other countries around the world in addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

N’Delta: Young Professionals Laud Emefiele For Supporting Youth Entrepreneurship,"The Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), has lauded the enviable strides of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, towards supporting the development of human capacity, especially among young people in the Niger Delta region.

Speaking on the sidelines of the 2nd Niger Delta MSME Summit held in Asaba, Delta State over the weekend, chairman of the NYPF and convener of the Summit, Mr Moses Siloko Siasia, appreciated the support to ensure the success of the Summit by Emefiele, stressing that the CBN Governor who is from Delta State, has been relentless in promoting human capacity building and creating purposeful opportunities for young people in the Niger Delta and Nigeria at large.

According to him: “The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele is one of the most diligent and determined public servants in Nigeria whose track record in human capacity building and creating purposeful opportunities for young people is unparalleled.

“Notable among numerous interventions initiated by the CBN under Emefiele’s leadership to productively engage youths and promote the spirit of entrepreneurship is the National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) which saw the apex bank released N3.0 billion to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 SMEs.

“Emefiele’s presence is also felt in Nigeria’s youth-dominant creative industry where N3.22 billion was disbursed to 356 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, software development, fashion, and IT verticals, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI).

“It also worthy to note that the Emefiele-led CBN in collaboration with Heritage Bank, inaugurated the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP) in March 2016 and has through the programme developed the entrepreneurial capacity of the youths as well as provided them with funds up to N3m each.

“Charity as they say, begins at home. It is for that reason Mr Emefiele has thrown his weight towards redirecting the kidnapping, militancy and destructive tendencies of youths in the Niger Delta region by supporting thousands several MSME programmes including the the 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit.”

The young professionals also commended the Nigerian Content and Development Board (NCDMB) led by Engr. Simbi Wabote, as well as the Heritage Bank led Ifie Sekibo, both of whom are from the Niger Delta.

So far, millions of business owners around the country have benefitted from the CBN Covid-19 Intervention Fund since the outbreak of the pandemic, to mitigate the impact on households and their businesses.

High point of the event was the sharing of heart-touching stories by some successful business owners in the Niger Delta. They appreciated stakeholders for the platform, stressing that they have grown successful businesses with youths under their employment, thereby creating jobs.

Five young entrepreneurs with standout businesses, got a grant of N500,000 each to expand their businesses. Also, an engineering firm, BlueCamel Energy Limited, owned by Mr Suleiman Yusuf, set aside another N25m to support five start-up engineers.

RSDF Boss Urges Investment In Grassroots Sports,"Founder and president of Ratel Sports Development Foundation (RSDF) and women football financier, Barrister Paul Edeh, has urged support for sports grassroots development to give Nigeria a facelift.

He called on both the private and public sector to invest in sports facilities at the grassroots saying it remained the catalyst that would propel young athletes to stardom.

Barrister Edeh who at the British Nigeria Academy (BNA) inter-house sports competition held in Abuja, said attributed Nigeria’s dwindling fortune in sports to jettison of inter-house sports competition.

“If we must nurture talents and make the best of our sporting industry in Nigeria, we must go back to the roots, the basics where we come from to discover talents.

“One of the biggest losses we have discovered in recent times is that we no longer encourage inter house sport or inter school sports where these talents should have been discovered.

“The impression I have always had is that basically the kids deserve to be given an opportunity and I think if we go back to the basics, we will have no challenge fielding talents in their right age in the sporting industry,” Barr. Edeh who owns one of the high-rising female clubs, Naija Ratels, in the top flight Nigeria Women Football League said.

Edeh who is also the chairman of Parents Teachers Forum (PTF) of the British Nigeria Academy, added: “Indeed, it has been quite refreshing to see parents taking part because of their children who are participating in various sports. For me, I’m very delighted that we in Ratel Sport Development Funds (RSDF) are part and parcel of what is happening today.

Aside from kitting the teams for final of the football event during the inter-house sports, the PTF donated balls and sports equipment to the school as numerous talents were discovered at various competitions at the end of the inter-house sports.

Ethnic Youth Leaders Condemn Attack On CBN Gov Emefiele,"The Nigerian Ethnic Youth Leaders Council (NEYLC), on Monday, condemned a newspaper report (not LEADERSHIP) for what it described as an unprovoked attack on the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Godwin Emefiele.

The NEYLC, which is made up of the Arewa Consultative Youth Movement (ACYM), Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youth, made its position known in a statement signed by the Ohanaeze Secretary-General and head of Coalition’s secretariat, Nwada Ike Chiamaka.

The ethnic youth leaders said it was surprising that the newspaper could descend so low to the point of criticising Emefiele for an ambition that he was yet to declare.

The group was reacting to a publication by a newspaper in which it cast aspersion on the friends and well-wishers of the CBN governor who have, based on his capability and achievements, called on him to contest the 2023 presidential election.

ADVERTISEMENT

The statement reads, ““It is, to say the least, very insulting for the newspaper to refer to the well-meaning individuals who have been appealing to Emefiele to contest as ‘his so-called committee of friends.’

“Referring to the group who means well for the country and wants Nigeria to be led by a responsible leader as ‘an amorphous group’ is unpardonable.

“We therefore call on the management of the newspaper to apologise to Emefiele and those who have been appealing to him to contest. The newspaper should also retrace its steps and restrict itself to the traditional role of informing the people and not playing to the gallery.”

APC’s Inability To Conduct Convention Shows State Of Nigeria Under Its Watch – PDP,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the inability of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to conduct a routine national convention as planned further explained why all sectors of national life in Nigeria have been in shambolic state under the APC administration.

The opposition party said APC’s postponement of its national convention yet again validates its stance that the APC is not a political party but a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of strange bed fellows, “political buccaneers” and ferocious power mongers on a mission to wreck the nation.

The PDP in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, on Tuesday, said the APC which cannot conduct its own internal affairs could not be expected to successfully manage the affairs of a nation like Nigeria.

“The APC is a perfect example of failure both as a party and government unable to conduct a simple National Convention in two years. It has become a Russian Roulette with unending request for extension of time to undertake a routine statutory political activity.

“Our Party is not surprised that the APC, a party of backstabbers, again postponed its National Convention already scheduled for February 26, 2022. It is rather saddening how a set of confused, greedy, deceitful, hard-heartened and self-centered individuals who cannot run a creditable organization foisted themselves in power and plunged our nation into the economic, security and social mess that we face today.

“As a vacuous political contraption without a soul, peopled by “political warlords” without conscience and operating without rules, the APC is a bunch of inchoate sailors clobbered together for remote personal gain; operating without a Board of Trustees (BoT) and a National Working Committee (NWC); exists in violation of rules while constituting itself to a threat to our national unity and corporate existence as a nation.

“APC’s postponement of its National Conventions had always been a fallout of the horrible infighting, backbiting and gang war by “political bandits” who are desperate for power and access to our national treasury. That explains why their congresses and other activities are always marred by violence, bloodletting and killings.

“Moreover, the APC is not capable of holding a National Convention having become defunct since December 8, 2020 when it dissolved all its states, zonal and national party structures and set up an illegal contrivance called the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State,” it said.

PDP added that activities of the Mai Mala Buni-led Committee remain invalid and unconstitutional by virtue of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which bars a sitting governor from holding “any other executive office” in any capacity whatsoever while serving as a state governor.

The party stressed that the failure of the APC to hold a National Convention is, therefore, a clear warning to those aspiring for various positions in the 2023 elections on its platform to note that with the APC, they are on a journey to nowhere.

“The only way the APC can legitimately participate in the 2023 general is to re-apply to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for fresh registration as a political party.

“In any case, Nigerians are hopeful for a better future because the PDP is back and repositioned to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the stranglehold of the APC in 2023.

“Nigerians are yearning for the return of good governance with the PDP so that they can again be secure, enjoy economic prosperity, infrastructural development, employment, food security and national cohesion which they experienced in the 16 years of the PDP in power,” the opposition party added.","The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the inability of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to conduct a routine national convention as planned further explained why all sectors of national life in Nigeria have been in shambolic state under the APC administration.

"2023: Ex-Lagos Governor, Tinubu Makes U-turn On ‘Fight Dirty Comment’","Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, has indicated that his statement that he promised to fight dirty if his presidential ambitions in 2023 were thwarted was taken out of context.

When Tinubu paid a visit to Senator Lekan Balogun, the Olubadan-designate, on Sunday, he accused the media of misrepresenting his comments.

Mr Tunde Rahman, his media aide, confirmed this in a statement released on Monday in Lagos State.

“This caption and report are inaccurate and erroneous. Sadly, the wrong headline and story have been latched on by some online platforms/blogs and commentators to pour invective on my person.

“These commentaries and remarks are unfortunate because they are groundless, misinformed and misdirected. Hence, this clarification has become imperative,” he said.

Tinubu stressed that at no time during the visit and in his speech did he indicate that he would fight dirty for his presidential ambition.

He noted that his words were carefully chosen stating that the people did not lend credence to such interpretation.

However, Tinubu, while addressing the Olubadan designate, said: “Kabiyesi, all I have come for is to beg you to continue to pray for me, the entire Yoruba race and the country.

“I am out to become the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and there is a wise saying that if you want to wrestle with the pig, be ready to get dirty and deal with the poo-poo.

"Niger: Insurgents’ explosives kill 4 NSCDC operatives, 6 civilians slain, 20 Zuru villages sacked by gunmen","The Nigeria Police Monday confirmed the attack on Galadima Kogo in Shiroro local government area of Niger state during which 10 persons, including four personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps ( NSCDC) were reportedly killed.

The NSCDC personnel were reported to be on rescue mission when their vehicle ran into the landmines.

Niger state Commissioner of Police Monday Bala Kuryas confirmed this in telephone interview with journalists in Minna.

He said: “Gunmen who invaded the community in the early hours of Monday in several motorcycles, first burnt down eight houses as well as the three buildings housing the Joint Security Task Force under renovation after the last month attack.”

The CP further explained that the detachment of police tactical squad and the military had been deployed to the area and launched manhunt with a view to tracking down the criminals.

“We appeal to residents to assist security personnel deployed with reliable information that could aid in apprehending miscreants. We are all out to deal with any person or group of people undermining the peaceful atmosphere our area,” Kuryas said.

In yet another interview, chairman of Shiroro local government council, Mallam Suleiman Chukuba, said the attack was launched by Boko Haram, going by the sophistication of the weapons they were seen carrying, including explosive devices.

“These are Boko Haram not bandits because they were heavily equipped with sophisticated weapons including explosive devices. This morning, Civil Defense vehicle ran into one of the explosive devices, their vehicle destroyed and many of them were killed,” he said.

The local government council boss e said the NSDC personnel were on their way to the community to ascertain the level of destruction by the gunmen.

“Only two out of the number of NSCDC in the vehicle survived the explosion and are in critical condition, receiving treatment at a government facility in Minna, the state capital.

“As I speak to you now, several buildings in the community are affected, everything was set ablaze and the entire community is deserted,” he said, adding that “right now we cannot ascertain the total number of people that have being killed, the situation is quite serious.”

NSCDC confirms

Meanwhile, the NSCDC has identified the personnel killed in the attack as Mohammed Ibrahim, an Assistant Superintendent of Corps 1, Cheche Ahmed, an Assistant Superintendent of Corps 11, Yunusa Mahmam, an Inspector of Corps, and Bala Abdullahi, a Corps Assistant 1.

The driver of the vehicle was also identified as Inspector Bala Adamu.

A statement released Monday in Abuja by the Corps spokesman, DCC Odumosu Olusola, said the injured driver had been rushed to the hospital for medical attention.

Olusola said: “The explosion occurred along Galadiman Kogo axis in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State at the early hours of Monday morning involving some officers and men of NSCDC Niger Command attached to Shiroro Hydro Power Station, Shiroro, Niger State on a routine patrol in the early hours of Monday morning when their patrol vehicle stepped on a buried land mine which exploded immediately killing all occupants except the driver who is currently in a very critical condition.

“The Commandant General, NSCDC, Ahmed Abubakar Audi, PhD, mni has commiserated with families of the deceased officers and men who paid the supreme price in service to the Nation and reassured residents of Niger of the Corp’s resolve and commitment to the security of lives and property of Nigerians without deterrence.”

We won’t relent -NGSG

In a related development, Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello expressed sadness over the attack coming barely three weeks after similar attacks during which many lives and properties were lost and several residents displaced.

In a statement Monday, the governor regretted that the attack was occurring at the time his administration was actively supporting the federal government-led efforts to overcome the menace of terrorism.

He said: “As Government, we are determined not to hands up to these dare-devil terrorists. Niger State is actively supporting the federal government led efforts to overcome the menace of these heartless terrorists.”

The governor lamented that his people had come under several attacks for no fault of theirs, adding that their lifestyle had been forced to change.

“I feel and share in their pains. I will not rest until their lifestyle returns to normal,” he assured.

While commiserating with the entire people of Shiroro local government area, particularly the affected communities, the governor re-iterated his commitment to taking every necessary steps to assuage the sufferings of the affected people by providing humanitarian interventions.

He also condoled with the security agencies over the loss of some of their personnel, sympathised with their family members, stressing that their sacrifices would not go in vain.

While reiterating the state government’s commitment to winning the war within the limited resources at its disposal, he prayed God to grant quick recovery to those injured and repose of the souls of those killed.

Kebbi

Similarly, there were fears in Kebbi state as bandits continued to kill and maim innocent citizens, forcing them to leave their places of abode in Zuru Emirate.

The bandits, according report, had gradually advanced to Koko/Besse local government area following a recent attack on the major trunk ‘A’ road linking the state with the south-western part of the country.

It was gathered that about 20 towns and villages were sacked in Zuru emirate of Sakaba and Danko/Wasagu local government areas.

The inhabitants were forced to take shelter at the Internally Displaced Camps(IDPs)’ camps in schools and other government buildings where security agents were also drafted to keep watch over them.

The villages recently attacked by the bandits in the emirate include, Shagero, Agale, Madi, Unguwar Chika, Tikawa, Mazarko, Sakaba, Makuku, Sanganga, Jan Birni, Doka, Leke, kwaganu, Daura, Kango, Giriza, Unguwar Zaure, Gareji and Doka Bera. In these towns and villages, an undisclosed number of people were killed while different species of animals like cows, sheep and goats were rustled.

Barely three days ago, the bandits reportedly crossed over to Yauri and Koko/Besse local government areas where they attacked motorists plying the highway connecting south-western part of the country en route to Lagos.

Bagudu cautions

Speaking during his visit to the IDPs’ camps, Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu warned the people against extra-judicial killings of innocent persons or labelling a particular tribe as solely guilty of banditry.

The IDPs were forced out of their towns and villages as a result of attacks by bandits, which led to the death of five persons in recent attack at Makuku Sargagi and Unguwar Zaure.

During the visit, Governor Bagudu rejoiced with Sakina Sanusi Maman Yan Biyu who gave birth to twins in the course of running away from bandits.

He assured the IDPs that efforts were on to resettle them in their various places while additional security personnel would be deployed to reinforce security.","The NSCDC personnel were reported to be on rescue mission when their vehicle ran into the landmines.

This hint also comes amid protests by civil society groups in Abuja demanding that President Buhari assent the bill.

The groups on Tuesday morning gathered and displayed various placards at the Unity Fountain asking the President to sign the bill.

Re-Amended Electoral Bill

The National Assembly on January 31, transmitted the re-amended Electoral Act Amendment Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.

The President said he will sign the bill when the necessary adjustment is done.

He said such changes must include the addition of consensus candidates, indirect primary options to the mode of selecting a candidate for an election, as against the initial direct mode as the only option to conduct primaries by political parties.","Hours after the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity told Channels Television that President Muhammadu Buhari will sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law soon, sources in the Presidency have put the likely time as tomorrow.

Putin Orders Russian Military To Act As ‘Peacekeepers’ In Ukraine Regions,"President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered Russia’s military to act as peacekeepers in two breakaway regions of Ukraine, just hours after he recognised them as independent.

Putin’s recognition of the separatist republics as independent effectively buries a fragile 2015 peace plan for the conflict, and opens the door for direct Russian military involvement.

In two official decrees, Putin instructed the defence ministry to assume “the function of peacekeeping” in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

Moscow provided no details or date for any deployment, with the order only saying that it “comes into force from the day it was signed”.

Russia has moved tens of thousands of soldiers to regions near Ukraine’s borders, with the West saying Moscow plans to use them for an attack at any moment.

In the same document, Putin also ordered his foreign ministry to “establish diplomatic relations” with the “republics”.

The agreement, published by Russia’s lower house of parliament, “creates a legal basis for the presence on the territory (of the two regions) of Russian military formations, whose presence is necessary to maintain peace in the region and ensure reliable security”.

"This Is The Only Major Fuel Scarcity Under Buhari’s Administration, Says Adesina","﻿

Nigeria has only witnessed one major fuel scarcity since the inception of the Muhammadu Buhari administration, says Mr Femi Adesina.

The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, stated this on Tuesday during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily.

“Each time this issue of the fuel scarcity come up, there is also a word that comes to my mind; that word is called SNAFU, and it’s an acronym for Situation Normal All Filed Ups.

“What happened is a SNAFU in the petrol supply chain in the country,” he said. “In the life of this administration which will be seven years in May, it is only one major fuel scarcity we have had.”

Not A Routine

Lagos, Abuja, and major cities across the country were hit with fuel scarcity following the recent importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol.

Amid an outcry over the situation which left many car engines damaged, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) said it has since withdrawn the adulterated petrol from the market.

It assured Nigerians that by the end of February, there would have been up to 2.1 billion litres of petrol in the country while millions of litres of the product were already in stock.

Despite the continued presence of long queues at filling stations, Adesina stressed that it should not be an opportunity for mischief makers to cause tension in the country.

“Now, there is a SNAFU, and some people are crying out as if heavens have fallen; no,” he said. “We should always consider the past and the present in this country. More than any other administration, this one (Buhari’s) has restored normalcy in petroleum supply for years.

“It is regrettable that Nigerians have had to stay hours on end at petrol stations. My driver also goes to queue up for hours before he gets fuel. Some people have had their car engines damaged, very regrettable.

“But then, we should not forget that it is not a routine or regular occurrence in the country and if there was an oversight, there is already a structure that can deal with that and we have been told that it’s going to be looked at.”","﻿Nigeria has only witnessed one major fuel scarcity since the inception of the Muhammadu Buhari administration, says Mr Femi Adesina.

Oil Hits Highest Since 2014 on Russia-Ukraine Escalation,"Oil hit its highest since 2014 on Tuesday as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, adding to supply concerns that are pushing prices to near $100 a barrel.

The United States and its European allies are poised to announce new sanctions against Russia after President Vladimir Putin formally recognised the two regions in eastern Ukraine, escalating a security crisis on the continent.

“The potential for a rally over $100 a barrel has received an enormous boost,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM. “Those who have bet on such a move anticipated the escalation of the conflict.”

Brent crude , the global benchmark, was up $3.48, or 3.7%, at $98.87 at 0900 GMT, having earlier reached $99.38, the highest since September 2014.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped $4.41, or 4.8%, to $95.48 versus Friday’s settlement, having earlier reached $96, also the highest since 2014. The U.S. market was closed on Monday for a public holiday.

The crisis over Ukraine has added further support to an oil market that has surged due to tight supplies as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, have resisted calls to boost supply more rapidly.

A senior British minister said on Tuesday Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created a situation as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

Nigeria’s minister of state for petroleum on Tuesday stuck to the OPEC+ view that more supply was not needed, citing the prospect of more production from Iran if its nuclear deal with world powers is revived.

Talks are ongoing on renewing Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers, which could eventually boost Iran’s oil exports by over 1 million barrels per day.","“The potential for a rally over $100 a barrel has received an enormous boost,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.

Russia Faces New Sanctions after Putin Recognise Breakaway Ukraine Regions,"The United States and its European allies are set to announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, deepening Western fears of a new war in Europe.

The Ukrainian military said two soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east in the past 24 hours, the most casualties this year, as ceasefire violations increased.

Putin’s announcement on Monday, and his signing of a decree on the deployment of Russian troops to the two breakaway regions, drew international condemnation and immediate U.S. sanctions, with President Joe Biden signing an executive order to halt U.S. business activity in the breakaway regions.

Rising fears of war pushed oil prices to a seven-year high on Tuesday, while safe-havens currencies including the yen rallied and global stocks tumbled.

“The United States will impose sanctions on Russia for this clear violation of international law and Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters after an emergency meeting of the Security Council late on Monday.

“We can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table and work toward peace.” read more

But a senior U.S. official said the deployment of Russian troops to the breakaway regions did not merit the harshest sanctions the United States and its allies had prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, as Russia already had troops there.

A senior British government minister said it was clear Putin had chosen confrontation over dialogue and Britain would respond with sanctions.

“You can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun,” Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.

He said the situation was as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

Russia has denied planning to attack its neighbour but it has massed troops on Ukraine’s borders and threatened “military-technical” action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including that Ukraine will never join NATO.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the recognition of the two regions did not affect Russia’s readiness for talks with the United States, the Tass news agency reported.

An EU diplomat said separately the meeting would consider how to act on a statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would “react with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act”.

China said it was concerned about the worsening situation and called for all parties to exercise restraint while Japan said it was ready to join international sanctions on Moscow in the event of a full-scale invasion.

Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, warned Western powers to “think twice” and not worsen the situation.

A Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.

WEST CONSIDERS HOW TO ACT

Britain said it had drawn up sanctions to target those complicit in the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and those measures would come into force on Tuesday.

European Union member states’ ambassadors will meet to discuss possible sanctions with limited sanctions a possible option, an EU official said. read moreAn EU diplomat said separately the meeting would consider how to act on a statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would “react with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act”.

A Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.

Russia needed to ratify its friendship treaties with the regions before it could discuss matters like the exact borders of the territories, RIA news agency reported, citing the foreign ministry. Russia’s parliament is expected to review friendship treaties on Tuesday.

In a lengthy televised address on Monday packed with grievances against the West, a visibly angry Putin said eastern Ukraine was ancient Russian land.

Putin delved into history as far back as the Ottoman empire and expressed frustration that Russia’s demands for a rewriting of Europe’s security arrangements had been repeatedly rebuffed.

“I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago – to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic,” Putin said.

Putin has for years worked to restore Russia’s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with Ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia.

The rouble extended its losses as Putin spoke, at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar.

A French presidential official said the speech “mixed various considerations of a rigid and paranoid nature”.","The United States and its European allies are set to announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, deepening Western fears of a new war in Europe.

Dubai Airport Busiest for Global Travel as Virus Persists,"Dubai’s main airport said Tuesday it has retained its top place as the world’s busiest for international travel with around 29 million passengers shuttling through the global gateway last year.

The 2021 passenger figures are encouraging for the tourism-driven economy of Dubai, regarded as a critical link between East and West. The numbers are sign that international travel has picked up somewhat since the coronavirus pandemic spawned unprecedented global lockdowns and border closures in 2020. Last year’s figure represents a 12% increase in traffic at Dubai International Airport compared to 2020, which had recorded nearly 26 million travelers.

Still, even with 29.1 million passengers crisscrossing last year through Dubai International Airport, or DXB, the figure is nowhere near the pre-pandemic milestone of 86.4 million in annual traffic logged by the airport in 2019.

Dubai is currently hosting the six-month-long World’s Fair, which was delayed by a year due to the pandemic. Expo 2020, which opened in October and runs until the end of March, has attracted millions of visitors as well as heads of state, royalty and celebrities, helping to further cement Dubai’s reputation as a global destination. It’s unclear, though, what the overall contribution of the Expo has been to Dubai’s economic recovery.

Just over 70% of Dubai’s airport traveler figures last year represent arrivals, with much of that likely residents traveling to and from the emirate. Prior to the pandemic, around half of all passenger figures were transiting through Dubai.

CEO of Dubai Airports, Paul Griffiths, said DXB forecasts 57 million travelers to come through the airport this year, and a full recovery to pre-pandemic figures by 2024.

“Dubai has done such a good job in reassuring travelers. It’s a safe city to visit and to come and holiday and do business. So I think the the actual trends to recovery are very encouraging, indeed,” Griffiths said.

It marks the eighth consecutive year that Dubai International Airport clinches the mantle of the world’s busiest for international travel, surpassing London’s Heathrow and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson for global travelers, although the latter is among the busiest in terms of overall passenger traffic.

The largest share of traffic to Dubai came from India, with 4.2 million travelers, followed by Pakistan, with 1.8 million travelers last year. A key growth market for travel to and from Dubai is neighboring Saudi Arabia, which is actively working to attract business and tourism in direct competition with Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates.

The UAE is home to more than 100,000 British citizens. Dubai’s main airport logged 1.2 million passengers from the U.K. last year, including 77,000 in December alone.

Dubai, under orders from the United Arab Emirates aviation authority, was forced to ground all passenger flights and close its airports for eight weeks in spring of 2020. Unlike the UAE’s capital of Abu Dhabi, though, Dubai quickly reopened its doors to travelers. Dubai has not required proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter and does not require a negative virus test to enter most places. This approach has not come without a cost. The UAE was red-listed as a “do not travel” country by the U.K., U.S. and other nations for much of last year.

“What we’re now trying to do is campaign globally for the relaxation of travel restrictions and testing,” Griffiths said. “But we now see the requirement for that is receding. We just need to get governments to recognize that fact and act quickly to remove the remaining travel restrictions.”

Overall, coronavirus infection figures remain relatively low across the UAE. The country has been aggressive in inoculating its population of more than 9 million people against COVID-19, most of whom are foreign residents and all of whom have been able to receive the vaccine free of charge.

While masks in public spaces are still required in Dubai, life in the city-state can otherwise feel unhindered by the pandemic. Just this week, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic stepped onto the tennis court to compete in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championship, his first tournament since being ejected from Australia and missing the year’s first Grand Slam event over his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19.","Dubai’s main airport said Tuesday it has retained its top place as the world’s busiest for international travel with around 29 million passengers shuttling through the global gateway last year.

‘Why Edo is prioritising women’s economic empowerment’,"Edo State governor’s wife Mrs. Betsy Obaseki has said the current administration is prioritising women’s economic empowerment and development, to enable them become more productive.

Mrs. Obaseki, the special guest of honour, spoke yesterday in Benin while opening a policy dialogue to reflect on women economic empowerment intervention and programming.

The programme was organised by Edo State Partnership for Advancing Women in Economic Development (PAWED) Advocacy Coalition.

It was supported by the development Research and Projects Centre (dRPC).

She said the government was ready to empower women.

The governor’s wife, represented by the Managing Director, EdoJOBS, Ukinebo Dare, noted that the Obaseki administration prioritised women’s empowerment through its interventions, targeted at improving women’s economic livelihood and development.

The Coordinator of PAWED Advocacy Coalition in Edo State, Mrs. Vivian Evbotokhai, said the Obaseki administration was taking the lead in investment in women’s economic empowerment.

She said the project was targeted at pushing for the state government to fulfil its commitment for women’s economic empowerment.

PAWED Advocacy Coalition’s Second Lead, Mrs. Bliss Ojeruse, said Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) had been recognised as a bridge to gender disparity across the globe.

Governor Godwin Obaseki has said the people will no longer subject themselves to any form of division, irrespective of party affiliation and religious background.

“Edo is one, irrespective of senatorial districts,’’ he said yesterday in Benin while swearing in newly-appointed permanent secretaries.

“We will not allow ourselves to be divided again; whether you are Edo South, Edo Central or Edo North, Edo is one.

“Some people just want to manipulate and try to create divisions where they don’t exist,’’ he said.

Responding on behalf of the permanent secretaries, one of them, Mr. Bernard Aigbe, thanked the governor for finding them worthy and promised that they would not fail in their duties.

The permanent secretaries are Iryn Omorogiuwa, Efosa Aisien, Nyamali Erumuse, Igbinomwanhia Abieyuwa, Imoihosen Oziegbe, Peter Osagie, Sabina Chikere, Osawemwenze Kayode-Iyasere and Bernard Aigbe.","Edo State governor’s wife Mrs. Betsy Obaseki has said the current administration is prioritising women’s economic empowerment and development, to enable them become more productive.

N2.6tr: NEITI board okays release of report in March,"The status of the payment of the N2.6 trillion owed the Federal Government by 77 oil and gas will be unveiled in March 2022.

The Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) Board-the National Stakeholders Working Group (NSWG) has approved the 2020 Oil and Gas audit report that will show how many firms have paid and how much they have remitted to the Federal Government coffers.

NEITI’s Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji made this known yesterday in a text message to The Nation .

His text message to an inquest from our Abuja correspondent reads: “Yes, Our 2020 Oil/gas report will be released next month-March, 2022. The report is ready, has just been approved by NEITI Board-the National Stakeholders Working Group (NSWG).”

The Nation had reported the postponement of the unveiling of the report to first quarter (Q1) of the year.

Our Abuja correspondent had reported that the watchdog organisation deferred the publication that it earlier scheduled to present last November.

Besides, on that, The Nation asked Orji whether NEITI would still unveil the audit report that month, he said the presentation had been postponed to last December.

Meanwhile, the NEITI boss said the organisation had to reschedule the presentation to capture issues emanating from the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).

Orji said: “As a result of reviews in scope and content to enable NEITI respond adequately to unfolding EITI emerging issues, matters arising from the post petroleum industry act, the 2020 oil and gas report will be ready within the first quarter of next year.”

He also said the NEITI will also commence the 2021 Oil and Gas industry audit next year.

He added that next year, the organization will commence the Mining Industry audit.

His words: “The conduct of 2021 industry reports, oil/gas and mining will also commence next year.”

It would be recalled that Orji had September in the press conference in Abuja urged the Federal Government to prevail on the 77 firms to remit their outstanding dues of Value Added Tax, Withholding Income Tax, Education Tax and the others amounting to N2.6 trillion to the government.

He said: “Now, the 2020 audit report will validate if these payments have been made by the companies. Our audit reports are published annually. Plans are on to release the 2020 report by November this year.”

Last November 12, when Orji was asked reveal how much the 77 companies had paid, he said: “The ongoing NEITI 2020 oil/gas independent industry audit to be released early next month will confirm the current status. I am in no position to speculate at this moment.”

Some days after the press conference, where he announced the outstanding debts to journalists, President Muhammadu Buhari gave a coalition of anti-graft agencies, including the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), the Independence Corrupt Practices and Other Crimes Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the approval to recover about N2.65 trillion unremitted funds from the 77 oil companies.

The NFIU Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Modibbo Tukur, who broke the news when he visited the NEITI secretariat to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two government organisations, said that it was unacceptable that government would be owed such huge funds at a time it was borrowing to fund major projects around the country.

He said the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, had been directed by the president to oversee the process, including the setting up of a panel of the anti-corruption agencies to recover the unremitted monies.

He said: “And that (NEITI’s hard work) has led to some kind of fruition because I briefed him (President Muhammadu Buhari) this morning and you may not be aware of it. This week, Mr President has approved officially all the recoveries to be done in this area. The minister of finance has been directed to set up a recovery panel with the EFCC, NEITI and NFIU in it and even NAPIMS and all the others.

“So, we are heading to maximum transparency. And there will be consolidation of data coming from NEITI, from NFIU and other agencies and there will be very clear reconciliation with the players and those regulating the sector. So, no more hiding of our national revenues. We all know what we are going through. Nobody wants to see the government borrow.”

He noted that although he had done some work in the past with the organisation, this time around, the new NEITI management was raising the standards in the execution of EITI principles, traversing the entire country and getting results.

“So we have the public accounts analysis and reporting. They analyse every government account from local government to federal in this country. So if the oil company has said that we are paying, we will be the one to tell them whether they have paid and that’s what we’re doing.

“And we have the oil, maritime and petroleum sector analysis we also have the natural environment analysis. So this is also a natural environment issue where people hide and they do illegal mining, they exploit, then they do certain things and they move it out of the country without even the ministry of mining knowing and sometimes they go as far as using this sector to finance terrorism.

“We ran into so many cases, in this particular area when we’re doing our analysis on terrorism. So, I think is the day to congratulate you because we are taking off and you will see the results because now we have all seen the zeal.

“Because you are talking about N2.6 trillion, then we reported over $5 billion, not paid in the area where the players are, which is the Niger Delta area. And then over N700 billion naira not paid, and in some cases companies receiving as agents and not even remitting. I think to achieve greater transparency in this area , it is good this time around to work with artificial intelligence, because if you are waiting for somebody to collect money and give you your own share, maybe it’s the day you are standing in front of God that he will pay you.

“Very soon both our teams will move to the ministry of finance, where we are going to sit down, call these companies and talk the real issues. We have walked the walk, so that the results will come in. And from that data you have and the one we have, the alert will start coming in very soon.

“The essence of this collaboration is to strengthen our partnership to be able to support each other, to ensure that resources available in our country are prudently managed in a manner that benefits all Nigerians.

“When I met you in February this year, I did say that an underlining importance of NFIU and NEITI collaboration in areas of managing information and data at our disposal in the oil, gas and mining sectors because of the strategic importance of the sector to our economy and the extensive work that I am aware the NFIU is doing in that sector.

“It’s been a long journey, but I am glad that the documents that are going to underpin our relationship is now ready for signing. This is a very fundamental aspect of our relationship with NFIU. We are very comfortable, very happy and appreciative of the job that agencies like yours are doing in that sector.

“We can’t all sit down and watch as a few people want to fritter the resources that are available. This country is in haste to develop and need resources to provide roads, water,electricity, build infrastructure for our people and our teeming youths and make life abundant and to reduce the exodus of our youths to other jurisdictions where they go and even things tougher.

“When we travel around the world and we meet Nigerians, I feel pained because some of them are the best talents and brains that can be more useful in our country.

The essence of this partnership is underpinned by the need for information sharing, joint preventive and remediation action in governance processes, especially in the extractive industry.

Also, regular capacity building and training, especially in the oil and gas and mining sector, joint stakeholder awareness creation, intelligence sharing, in the extractive industry and investigations. We need to also partner with technical committees that will execute, and provide content for actualisation of this MOU.

He said that the plan would be enhanced by regular meetings and more importantly supporting in investigating issues bordering on criminality arising from NEITI industry reports in oil, gas and mining sector.

Everyday we get reports of illegal mining, extortion and selling of our mineral in the international market without any consideration, especially in the area that these activities border on our national security and expressed joy that the president has responded to the plea of the organisation.

In the course of its engagements, Orji explained that NEITI had met with the EFCC, ICPC with the climax being NFIU, which will go beyond signing papers, but ensuring that there’s action in executing the mandate that they got from Buhari.","NEITI’s Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji made this known yesterday in a text message to The Nation .

‘Zone APC presidential ticket to Southeast’,"Northern youths yesterday urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the Southeast.

The youth, under the auspices of the Concerned Northern APC Youth Forum, said this at a briefing in Abuja.

They also called on the APC and Nigerians to support the Presidential ambition of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State.

Umahi had, in January, declared his intention to contest for president in 2023 on the platform of the APC.

The Forum said their call on the APC to give the Southeast a chance and also support for Umahi was borne out of its consultation tour of the 19 Northern states on the issues.

In a chat with reporters yesterday in Abuja, the Chairman of the Forum, Suleiman Liba, said justice, fairness and equity must come to play in electing the country’s next president.

He insisted that Umahi remains the best candidate to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari due to his record of achievements in Ebonyi State.

“In David Umahi, we have found a worthy successor to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.

“The man’s antecedents of excellence speak volumes and his achievements in Ebonyi State are there for everyone to see.

“We urge other bodies across the entire country to support David Umahi’s presidential bid as this is the surest way for Nigeria to go,” he added.","Northern youths yesterday urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the Southeast.

‘Wives demanding money from husbands before sex are satanic’,"The Spiritual Director, Ave-Maria Prayer Ministry, Ifite Awka, Anambra State, Brother Livinus Okeke, has warned women against asking for money as a condition for having sex with their husbands.

He said such acts were not only satanic, but also attracted curses to their homes and families.

Speaking during a service to mark the 10th anniversary of the ministry, the cleric described many mothers as ‘packaged troublemakers’ to their husbands.

He said such husbands lived daily in bondage, as the couple co-habited as cat and dog, hence extending bad seeds to their children.

Okeke said: “Some wives now demand N20,000 or thereabouts from their husbands before going to bed with them.

“Some husbands don’t even have a say in the family. The only respect the wife accords him, if she likes, is ‘good morning’.

“Such homes lack progress and peace, as the children in turn start putting into practice what they learn from their parents.”

Frowning at husbands who were in the habit of returning home empty, Okeke praised those who always thought about home anytime they travelled.

Said he: “Some do that to also keep their wives happy and that is the love we are talking about. When you were about marrying her, you showed you were capable, but now what has happened?

“For peace and prosperity of the family, both husband and wife must work, think and reason together so that the blessing of the Lord will be showered on them.”

The cleric described the 10th anniversary as a celebration of amazing grace, great favour, health, deliverance, divine turnaround, connections and all round goodness of God.","The Spiritual Director, Ave-Maria Prayer Ministry, Ifite Awka, Anambra State, Brother Livinus Okeke, has warned women against asking for money as a condition for having sex with their husbands.

JUST IN: Buhari to sign electoral bill Friday -Presidential aide,"JUST IN: Buhari to sign electoral bill Friday -Presidential aide

There are stong indications that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), will sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, on Friday.

Sources in the presidency said the President had been briefed on the amendments and “should sign latest Friday if nothing else comes up”.

Also, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had earlier confirmed that the President could sign the bill on Thursday or Friday.

He gave the hint during an interview with Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme Tuesday night.

Adesina said, “He (Buhari) will sign it (the bill) any moment from now.

“It could be today, it could be tomorrow, it could be anytime, but within the 30 days.

“It could be signed today; it could be signed tomorrow. In a matter of hours, not days. Hours could be 24 hours, it could be 48 hours; not days, not weeks.”

On January 31, 2022, the National Assembly transmitted the reworked amendment bill to the President for assent.

Buhari consequently forwarded it to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), for legal advice.

By law, the President is expected to respond to the National Assembly’s proposal not more than 30 days after receiving it.

The PUNCH reports that the President has in the last five years rejected electoral amendment bills five times.

The INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, had said last month said the new law was needed to enable the commission release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election.

"Ukraine crisis different from Taiwan claims, says China","China on Wednesday dismissed comparisons between the Ukraine crisis and its own claim over Taiwan, after the self-ruled island’s president said evidence of Russian aggression was being used to hurt Taiwanese morale.

Democratic Taiwan has watched the Ukraine situation closely as it lives under the constant threat of a Chinese invasion, with Beijing claiming sovereignty over the island and vowing to seize it one day — by force if necessary.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday “external forces” were “attempting to manipulate the situation in Ukraine and affect the morale in Taiwan’s society”, and urged the government to be “more vigilant against cognitive warfare”.

Beijing said any comparison showed a “lack of the most basic understanding of the history of the Taiwan issue”.

“Taiwan, of course, is not Ukraine,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press conference.

“Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China’s territory. This is an irrefutable historical and legal fact,” she said, blasting “unwise” Taiwanese authorities for “making the Ukraine issue into a hot topic”.

Earlier, Tsai said, “Our government condemns Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty… and urges all parties to continue to resolve the disputes through peaceful and rational means.”

Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan since Tsai came to power in 2016, as she rejects the stance that the island is Chinese territory.

Taiwan’s defence ministry said last year that China had launched a disinformation campaign aimed at seizing the island “without a fight”.

Tsai on Wednesday also told national security and military units to remain vigilant and step up surveillance of military activities around Taiwan.

The final quarter of 2021 saw a massive spike in incursions by Chinese warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone.

Last year, Taiwan recorded 969 such incursions, according to a database compiled by AFP — more than double the roughly 380 in 2020.

Beijing has trod a cautious line on Ukraine but also offered growing support to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The two powers signed a joint statement this month, agreeing on multiple foreign policy goals including no further expansion of NATO and that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China”.

Chinese officials have also repeatedly sided with Russia in blaming the West for the tensions over Ukraine, accusing them of a “Cold War mentality” while describing Moscow’s security concerns as “reasonable”.","China on Wednesday dismissed comparisons between the Ukraine crisis and its own claim over Taiwan, after the self-ruled island’s president said evidence of Russian aggression was being used to hurt Taiwanese morale.

Airfare Hike: Senate demands urgent rehabilitation of federal roads,"The Senate has called on the Federal Government to urgently declare a state of emergency on the nation’s federal roads.

The upper chamber also urged the government to immediately make good its indebtedness to FERMA in order to enable the agency carry out its primary responsibility of rehabilitating federal roads, especially in the face of the astronomical increase in airfares.



These were resolutions reached, yesterday, by the Senate, following a point of order raised to draw its attention to the increase in airfare and the implication for Nigerian roads.

Rising under Orders 41 and 51 of the Senate Standing Orders, Senator Gershom Bassey lamented that local airfares in Nigeria had risen by 63 per cent, in response to a spike in the price of aviation fuel and attendant cost of operation.



According to him, the rise in airfare has pegged the minimum economy class ticket at around N80,000 for travellers buying one-hour, one-way economy tickets.



He expressed worry that the increase in airfares would increase the pressure on the neglected and dilapidated Nigerian roads and further worsen their state.

The lawmaker noted that the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency, FERMA, had a budgetary approval of just 20 per cent of the funds the agency requires for the rehabilitation of about 35,000km of federal roads in 2022.



Bassey observed that N850 billion that is to accrue to FERMA by virtue of the five percent user charge on pump price of petrol, diesel, and international vehicle transit charges provided for in Section 14 of FERMA (Amendment) Act No.18 of 2007 is still being owed FERMA by the Federal Government.



“The humongous debt owed FERMA by the Federal Government has hampered the effective discharge of FERMA’s primary responsibility of road maintenance and rehabilitation,” he said.

"Alleged N2.9bn Fraud: Ex-Imo Gov, Okorocha, evading charge — EFCC","Seeks more time to effect service, as court shifts trial to March 28

By Ikechukwu Nnochiri – Abuja

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Tuesday, alleged that a former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, evaded service of the 17-count fraud charge it preferred against him and five others.

The anti-graft agency told the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja that several efforts it made to effect service of the charge on Okorocha, failed.

Counsel to the Commission, Mr. Cosmos Ugwu, decried that while all the other Defendants were in court for their scheduled arraignment, the former governor, made himself inaccessible.

“My lord, ordinarily, this matter is for arraignment, but unfortunately, the 1st Defendant is not in court.

“We made several efforts to serve the 1st Defendant with the charge but could not succeed.

“All the other Defendants have been served.

“We are therefore asking for a date to enable us to effect service on the 1st Defendant”, the Prosecution counsel added.

EFCC’s application for an adjournment was not opposed by counsel to the other Defendant, Mr. Oba Maduabuchi, SAN.

Consequently, trial Justice Inyang Ekwo adjourned the matter till March 28.

Okorocha, who piloted affairs of Imo state from 2011 to 2019, was charged before the court following his alleged complicity in a N2.9billion fraud.

He was charged alongside a chieftain of the All Progressive, APC, Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, and five companies- Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited.

EFCC alleged that the Defendants conspired and diverted public funds into private accounts for their personal use.

According to the anti-graft agency, the Defendants committed the alleged offence between October 2014 and February 2016.

It alleged that the Defendants sequentially siphoned funds from the Imo State Government House account and Imo State Joint Local Government Project account, and diverted same into accounts of private firms.

It will be recalled that Okorocha who is currently the Senator representing Imo West, had recently declared his intention to contest for presidency in the 2023 general elections.

Pastor in Police net for raping church member during deliverance,"The suspect

By James Ogunnaike

ABEOKUTA – Operatives of Ogun State command of Nigeria Police have arrested a pastor in charge of Life and Power Bible Church, Ogijo, Pastor Mathew Oladapo, for ‘forcefully’ having unlawful carnal knowledge of a 19 year old member of the church (name withheld).

The command Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a statement in Abeokuta, the State capital, said, the pastor was arrested following a report lodged at Ogijo divisional headquarters by the victim.

Oyeyemi said, the victim reported that “while attending the church service on the 20th of February 2022, the pastor told her that he saw a vision that she is having a spiritual husband which she needs to be delivered of”.

“She stated further that the pastor told her she will undergo three nights of fasting and prayer in the church for total deliverance”.

“In addition, she was asked to come to the church with 1,000 naira note and anointing oil”.

“But on the first night of the fasting and prayer, she was taken to a room within the church where the pastor ordered her to pull off her clothes and undies and lay down on a piece of cloth on the floor which she obeyed”.

“While lying on the floor, the pastor started rubbing the anointing oil on her body and inserted his finger into her private part”.

“When she protested, the pastor pinned her down, covered her mouth and forcefully had sex with her with the claim that it is the only way to break bond between her and the spirit husband”.

“Upon the report, the DPO Ogijo division,CSP Onatufe Umoh, detailed his detectives to the scene where the randy pastor was promptly arrested”.

“On interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime but claimed to have been overwhelmed by spirit”.

Meanwhile, the State Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to anti human trafficking and child labour unit of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and diligent prosecution.

"By-election: Imo APC unleashing violence, abducting our leaders — PDP","Allegation blatant falsehood — APC

By Chinonso Alozie – Owerri

The Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Tuesday, alleged that the All Progressives Congress, APC, has unleashed violence on leaders of the PDP and is plotting to abduct some of their leaders ahead of the Ngor Okpala by-election scheduled for Saturday.

The state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Emenike Nmeregini made this known to newsmen in Owerri.

PDP raised the alarm, saying that the APC sent their thugs to cause havoc at a PDP rally in Ntu community in Ngor-Okpala, last Monday.

To this extent, the PDP said it has called the security agencies and international communities to come and monitor the happenings in Saturday’s Ngor Okpala bye-election.

According to PDP, “The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the state has observed a plot by the APC-led administration to disrupt voting in polling units across Ngor-Okpala, by stationing ten hoodlums per pooling unit, to perfect their plans of rigging the election.

Also exposed is APC’s plan to arrest and whisk away notable PDP leaders in the local government area just to ensure no one stands on their way to rigging the state constituency bye-election slated for Saturday in Ngor Okpala.

“The APC in Imo, realizing how unpopular it is and that it cannot win any peacefully conducted election, has now resorted to violence. The party candidate on Monday, 21st February 2022 unleashed havoc on PDP supporters using hoodlums and militia men and dispersed a PDP rally in the Ntu Community in Ngor-Okpala. They threatened to maim anybody who dares to attend the rally. But of course, Ntu people resisted them and came out in their hundreds.

“The PDP notes with dismay the desperate move by Uzodimma to give ten bags of rice to each polling unit to entice the voters. We, therefore, condemn vote buying and undue inducement of voters in Ngor Okpala.

Unfortunately, the APC government which brought untold hardship to lmo people is trying to use food as bait to catch votes. Ngor Okpala people are proud and hardworking, so their conscience cannot be bought with mere rice.

“Imo PDP, therefore, wishes to use this medium to alert the security agencies in the state of the atrocities the APC plans to perpetuate in Ngor-Okpala and calls on them to move in and ensure a hitch-free election and the security of lives and property of the people.

The PDP also uses this medium to call on the international community, civil society organisations and all lovers of peace and democracy to be at alert as APC plans to subvert the wishes of Ngor-Okpala people on Saturday, 26th February 2022,” PDP said.

When Vanguard called the APC State Publicity Secretary, Cajetan Duke, he said he was in a meeting and would call back.

But reacting to the development, the Imo State Government rubbished the claim by the PDP.

A statement by Declan Emelumba, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Imo State said: “The PDP’s Claim that Governor Hope Uzodimma is giving 10 bags of rice to each polling unit for the bye-election is an absurd baseless and complete falsehood, coming from a sinking party that foresees defeat on Saturday.

“The PDP knows that it will lose the bye-election, hence it is looking for an alibi. Governor Hope Uzodimma is a democrat who believes that people will always freely choose who they want in an election unhindered. He will never subscribe to vote-buying.

“At any rate, Ngor-Okpala people are sufficiently enlightened not to return an irresponsible party that abandoned their seat in the house of Assembly for two years, to the same House. The PDP should cover its face in shame and apologise to Ngor-Okpala people for treating them with utmost disrespect and disdain.”

Vanguard News Nigeria","Allegation blatant falsehood — APCBy Chinonso Alozie – OwerriThe Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Tuesday, alleged that the All Progressives Congress, APC, has unleashed violence on leaders of the PDP and is plotting to abduct some of their leaders ahead of the Ngor Okpala by-election scheduled for Saturday.
PDP raised the alarm, saying that the APC sent their thugs to cause havoc at a PDP rally in Ntu community in Ngor-Okpala, last Monday.
“The APC in Imo, realizing how unpopular it is and that it cannot win any peacefully conducted election, has now resorted to violence.

"Man, 36, sentenced to death for armed robbery in Akwa Ibom","By Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo

Akwa Ibom State High Court sitting in Uyo presided over by Justice Archibong Archibong

has sentenced a 36-year-old man, Destiny James Okon to death for armed robbery.

Okon native of Ikot Andem Itam in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, was condemned on Tuesday, February, 22 after the Court found him guilty of robbing Ubotex warehouse in Ifa Ikot Okpon, Uyo, on 15th December, 2015.

Justice Archibong, in a two-hour judgement however discharged and acquitted two other accused persons, 40-year-old Ikechukwu Eme from Anambra State and Nwaigbo Kelechi, 36, from Ebonyi State, of the charges.

The trio were standing trial on a three-count of conspiracy, armed robbery, and unlawful possession of firearms.

Destiny Okon had confessed to the Police that Ikechukwu Eme, who is the second accused person, told him that he had a job to monitor when he took him to Ubotex warehouse in a broad daylight and posed as customers and returned at night to rob the warehouse.

He explained that one “Hausaman, Musa” called him 15th day of December, 2015 to assist him to custody some Cameroon Zinc, which he accepted and took them to his father’s house in Okobo, Ibiono Ibom.

He also told the court that Eme, whom he claimed deals in buying scrap items, was invited to buy the Zinc but told “Musa” that he would not buy the items because they were not scrapped, except Musa would provide receipts of the Zinc.

The first accused said since then Musa has not come back until he was arrested on 18th December, 2015.

In a judgement in the suit number HU/63C/ 2015, Justice Archibong held that “it is obvious that the acclaimed Hausaman ‘Musa” is a fictitious person manufactured by the accused persons with the aim of misleading the Police in the course of investigation”

He described it “as a ploy to deceive this Court into considering that someone else committed the offense of armed robbery or that the first accused person did not participate in the robbery”.

The Court further held that the Prosecution by circumstantial evidence of the Doctrine of Recent Possession, has established its case beyond reasonable doubt.

“It was clear case of violation of the presumption in Section 419 of the Evidence Act 2019 now Section 107 (5) of the Evidence Act 2010, being the statutory version of the English Doctrine of Recent Possession.

” It could not have otherwise if a person is found in possession of property which was properly reported to have been recently stolen with or without violence from another person.

“From the total of the evidence, in this case, I can deduce that Musa is a fiction of the imagination of the accused persons. You are hereby sentenced to death. You shall die in a manner to be directed by Akwa Ibom State Governor. May God have mercy on your soul.” Court held.

Filling station queues vanish as fuel scarcity eases in Kaduna,"Car owners and other petrol users in Kaduna State can heave a sigh of relief as the long queues experienced for days have begun to disappear.

DAILY POST reports that many petrol stations across the state have opened for normal business as supply has gradually increased with the price remaining the same.

Commercial bus and taxi drivers have also reduce transport fares which were increased for days while the scarcity lasted.

Mrs Rhoda Achile, who works with the Federal Ministry of Labour along Muhammed Buhari Way, said she spent N500 to the office since the fuel scarcity started but today, she only spent N200 being the normal transport fare before the fuel scarcity.

Also, a taxi driver, Mr Nicodemus Nawaya told DAILYPOST on Wednesday in Kaduna that he filled his taxi with N20,000 since the fuel scarcity began, but as of Tuesday and Wednesday, he only spent N15,000 to fill his tank.

“Before the fuel scarcity, I filled my motor tank with N13,500 and N14,000 respectively. The fuel will take me till evening when I closed from work. But, since the scarcity began, I spent N20,000 or more before I close from work.

“However, now, the price has reduced and hope it will not increase any longer,” he said.

Most filling stations; Oando, Jampet, Omapet, filling stations were selling at normal prices, as most drivers did not spend up to ten minutes before being attended to.

Alhajji Salisu Magaji, a bus driver said, he only spent ten minutes before refilling his tank at Oando filling station.

According to him, he only met two drivers ahead of him, at the filling station, and that was because, NEPA ceased light, as they have to wait for some minutes to start the generator.

The manager of the Oando filling station, Mr James Obochi told DAILYPOST that any fuel supply is carefully monitored, checked to ensure it’s not contaminated.

This, according to him, was to avoid embarrassment from stakeholders.","Commercial bus and taxi drivers have also reduce transport fares which were increased for days while the scarcity lasted.

It’s not too late to reverse your anti-people policies – Pastor Giwa tells Buhari,"The senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to think twice and amend his mistakes on the anti-people policies introduced by his government since 2015 to date.

Giwa, who stated this in Akure, Ondo State capital, while addressing his members, urged President Buhari to amend his ways.

Specifically, the fiery pastor questioned why President Buhari deliberately plunged the country into disorderliness since 2015 to date.

“Let me also say this very clearly, before president Buhari runs out of time, he needs to amend his mistakes and think of his age.

“Ordinarily, when you get to the final stage of human development. I mean from age 65 until death, you ought to have changed for the better and do your best to lay a good foundation for others.

“But, as it is in Nigeria, our political leaders don’t think about legacies they are leaving behind. They want to finish Nigeria before they go, forgetting that we all have limited time.

“President Buhari, by now, is 80 years of age. What else does he want? Why can’t he change for the better to make the people laugh?

“Scarcity of fuel has hit Nigeria; banditry, terrorism and poverty have taken over the country. If you cannot lead us to our destinations, please, take us back to where you met us.

“Many of you were in this church at a programme around 2015 where I warned Nigerians from voting for the All Progressives Congress.

“I told you they were only desperate for power and nothing else. Did they not get the power? What did they use the power for? They used it against the masses who voted for them.

“Please, shine your eyes and wake up. These people don’t mean well for Nigerians, but God will rescue His people from the hands of oppressors in no time,” Giwa said.","The senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to think twice and amend his mistakes on the anti-people policies introduced by his government since 2015 to date.

"Learn from Ugwuanyi – HURIWA tells Nigerian governors, condemns attack on commissioner","Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has recommended the Governor of Enugu State for what it describes as the ‘Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi democracy model’.

The human rights advocacy group further hailed the administration for its zeal for consistent local government elections as currently practised in the state.

It said that Ugwuanyi’s leadership style should be replicated in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.

HURIWA said that the governors of the South-East must borrow a leaf on good governance and the ‘live and let live’ mantra of Governor Ugwuanyi as their leadership model.

HURIWA said this in a statement by its national coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf.

It compared what has happened preparatory to the Enugu council polls to what usually happens in an advanced democracy like Britain just before the British council polls.

“We are happy that here in the Nigerian state of Enugu, we have a political class that believes that legitimacy to exercise political and constitutional authority over the affairs of the citizens emanates from the good people of Nigeria,” the group said.

“The pragmatic campaigns initiated by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for the Council poll is a fantastic demonstration of leadership by example and we perfectly relate this to what obtains in advanced democracies like the USA; UK and Canada whereby the wheel of democracy derives its fuel from the electorate.

“This attitudinal and political modus operandi should be sustained and borrowed by other Federation units so we mainstream pragmatic constitutional democracy around the length and breadth of Nigeria in the shortest possible time frame”.

HURIWA has also relatedly, condemned the report of violent attack targeting a commissioner serving in Enugu whose two police orderlies were killed by gunmen in the neighbouring Anambra State.

The rights group further condemned the disquiet that happened in the state on Monday when the state Commissioner for Lands, Chidi Aroh, reportedly escaped death by the whiskers.

Gunmen were said to have attacked the commissioner and allegedly killed two police orderlies.

It was gathered that the incident happened on Sunday evening when Aroh was returning from the neighbouring Anambra State, where he was said to have attended a meeting on Saturday.

Although the Anambra State Police Command confirmed the incident, it, however, HURIWA said the whereabouts of the policemen were yet to be known.

HURIWA called on security agencies in the South-East to come together and combat the rising tension in the region and arrest the real perpetrators of violence on innocent citizens.","Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has recommended the Governor of Enugu State for what it describes as the ‘Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi democracy model’.

FG declares ASUU strike illegal after conciliatory meeting ends in deadlock,"There are indications that the conciliatory meeting called by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige to deliberate on the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, ended in deadlock early Wednesday morning, a development that may have prompted a declaration of the strike as illegal by the Federal Government.

While the government insists that the demands raised by the union were already being met, ASUU thinks otherwise.

Addressing stakeholders at the meeting, Ngige described the ongoing strike as a clear breach of the law, adding that the union did not go through the normal process before embarking on the industrial action.

He also faulted ASUU’s action, saying it did not give the Federal Government the minimum 14 days strike notice prescribed by the law, prior to the strike.

His words, “I saw their letter in my office on February 18, which is last Friday and as you know, they started their action on Monday, February 14. So, it is a clear breach of labour laws. There are violations.

“If you must notify us of intending strike action, you give us a minimum of 14 days’ notice. I pointed out to them that we are a country guided by laws. Nobody is above the law. They should obey it.”

Ngige also explained that the Trade Disputes Act permits him to apprehend the strike and having done so, the industrial action should seize.

The meeting between the warring parties may continue on Monday next week as Ngige vowed to approach the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) to also intervene.

“By Monday, we would have dealt with some of the issues they are talking about and return to them for further discussion. We will meet again with them and the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) and we take it from there.” Ngige had stated.

DAILY POST recalls that ASUU is adamant about the continuation of the strike until government fully addresses demands bothering on revitalization funds, implementation of the Integrated Personnel Payrolls System (IPPIS) among others.","While the government insists that the demands raised by the union were already being met, ASUU thinks otherwise.

Oil hits $97 on Russia-Ukraine war game,"Oil rose to its highest since 2014 yesterday after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, adding to supply concerns that are pushing prices towards $100 a barrel.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up $1.93, or two per cent, at $97.32, having earlier reached its highest since September 2014 at $99.50.

United States’ West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped by $2.96, or 3.3 per cent, from Friday to $94.03, with the market having been closed on Monday for a public holiday. WTI also touched a seven-year high on Tuesday as it peaked at $96.

“The potential for a rally over $100 a barrel has received an enormous boost.

“Those who have bet on such a move anticipated the escalation of the conflict, ” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.

Julius Baer analyst, Norbert Rucker, added: “We see the oil market in a period of frothiness and nervousness, spiced up by geopolitical fears and emotions.

“Given the prevailing mood, oil prices may very likely climb into the triple digits in the near term.”

The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, stated this yesterday at the Sixth GECF Summit in Doha, Qatar, where represented President Muhammadu Buhari.

The Senior Adviser (Media & Communications) to the minister, Horatius Egua, made this known in a statement.

The aide said: “The recent enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is an indication of our commitment to derive more value from natural gas by providing the required governance, regulatory and fiscal framework to support the growth of the industry.”

Buhari said Nigeria, a gas province with some oil, “is committed to sustainable growth of natural gas exploitation and utilization, both for domestic use and export via LNG and pipeline gas to sub-regional African countries” stressing that “Nigeria is embarking on different initiatives, projects, and policies to enhance the performance of the oil and gas sector”.

He listed some of the gas initiatives Nigeria is currently embarking upon to include the National Gas Expansion Program (NGEP), designed to provide framework and policy support to extend gas supply and utilization in power generation, gas-based industries, and in emerging niche gas sectors such as gas in transportation LPG for cooking and remote virtual gas supply using trucks to convey LNG and CNG to industries.

The others initiatives according to the president are the Ajaokuta-Abuja-Kano gas pipeline to support 5 billion cubic feet per day of domestic gas utilization in the near term and 5-Gigawatt power generation, the expanding of the current LNG production capacity to about 30 million tons per annum at Bonny with the on-going N-LNG Train 7 project and the declaration of 2021-2030 as the Decade of Gas towards a gas-powered economy, that would not only lower Nigeria’s GHG emissions but also reduce the country’s import bills.

The President noted that with natural gas projected to be the leading fossil fuel in the energy transition, “the GECF, given its member countries vast natural gas resources and experience in the oil and gas industry, is well positioned to provide stewardship and credible platform to promote natural gas as a sustainable fuel for an effective energy transition. ..We therefore need to continue to assess the gas and energy market dynamics both in the short, medium, and long-term timeframe with the aim of taking market opportunities and collectively address the challenges.

To achieve the set objectives, he called for the “need to work together as policy makers, investors, the energy industry decision makers, researchers, and technology developers to make modern energy sources such as natural gas available and affordable to all”.

While restating Nigeria’s commitment to Conference of Parties (COP26) Glasgow declaration towards zero carbon emissions, the president however noted the importance of natural gas for effective energy transition towards a low carbon future and as a fuel for socio-economic development, taking into consideration its credentials such as abundant, flexible, cleanest fossil fuel, and its versatility.

The Ukraine crisis has added further support to an oil market that has surged on tight supplies as demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, together known as OPEC+, have resisted calls to boost supply more rapidly.

A senior British minister on Tuesday said that Russia’s move into Ukraine has created a situation as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when a confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

Nigeria’s minister of state for petroleum on Tuesday stuck to the OPEC+ view that more supply was not needed, citing the prospect of more production from Iran if its nuclear deal with world powers is revived.

Talks are ongoing on renewing Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers, which could eventually boost Iran’s oil exports by more than 1 million barrels per day.","- Advertisement -“Those who have bet on such a move anticipated the escalation of the conflict, ” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.
Julius Baer analyst, Norbert Rucker, added: “We see the oil market in a period of frothiness and nervousness, spiced up by geopolitical fears and emotions.
..We therefore need to continue to assess the gas and energy market dynamics both in the short, medium, and long-term timeframe with the aim of taking market opportunities and collectively address the challenges.

"National convention: Finally, APC agrees on zoning","From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has agreed on a zoning formula that would swap its national offices held between the north and south in the last eight years.

The decision was part of the outcome of the meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and APC governors in Abuja, yesterday.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The governors had tabled their decisions on the forthcoming national convention of the party before the president during the meeting which lasted for about 15 minutes.

Speaking to State House Correspondents on the outcome of the meeting, Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, explained that all offices occupied by northerners in the last eight years would go to the south while the south would take up offices occupied by northerners under the new arrangement.

Going by the agreement, the positions to be swapped to the north are National Chairman, National Organising Secretary, National Youth Leader, National Auditor and National Deputy Publicity Secretary. In the same vein, the positions to be taken up by southerners in the party are National Secretary, National Treasurer, National Woman Leader, National Youth Leader, National Publicity Secretary, National Deputy Organising Secretary and National Special Leader.

El-Rufai said the agreement was reached in line with the zoning formula in the party.

“We have agreed to a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, the northern zone will have the positions the south have had in the last eight years. And vice versa. It is a very simple, equitable and fair formula.

“We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention,”

The Kaduna governor said the APC governors were divided over the timing of the national convention.

“There were some governors that felt that we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress’s issues in some states. As you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.

“In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra state agreeing on any issue. We can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we’re all on the same page.”

Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, however said the APC governors were not divided.

“Are governor divided? Not at all. The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President, we are appreciative of his leadership, we commend him for his leadership, we are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thanked them to the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.”

Bugudu said President Buhari was in favour of a consensus arrangement for the selection of candidates for party offices.

He said though the planned zonal congresses of the APC is not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.

Chairman, Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, dismissed fears that the ruling party will collapse at the end of President Buhari’s era.

At the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.","The decision was part of the outcome of the meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and APC governors in Abuja, yesterday.

"…Postponement: Kalu thanks Buhari, Buni for consideration of request","Chief Whip of the senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has applauded President Muhammadu Buhari and Chairman, Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, for the postponement of the party’s national convention earlier scheduled for February 26.

Kalu, who recently returned from Germany, said the decision was in tandem with his earlier request to the president and National Caretaker Chairman of the party. He noted that getting it right was more important than just holding a convention for the sake of it.

“For a stronger and a near perfect APC, it is important that the party seizes the opportunity this postponement has created to correct any abnormally in the party,” he said

Kalu, former Abia State governor, emphasised that his earlier call for the postponement of the convention was based on the realities that would hit the party should the convention hold unprepared .

“I was misunderstood in some quarters when I pleaded with the party to consider postponement of the convention. I am glad the President and Caretaker Chairman has considered the request because of it’s necessity,” he said

On December 16, 2021, Kalu had in his letter to Governor Mai Mala Buni, warned that holding the APC convention in February without sorting out minor disagreements that arose during the congress could lead to implosion.

He also, in the letter, appealed for the conduct of presidential primaries and election of National Working Committee (NWC) of the party same day.

According to him, some states are embroiled in crisis with multiple factions arising from the congress.

Excerpts of the letter read: “I must also commend your peaceful disposition and sense of commitment to the growth of our party which also saw very peaceful congresses across the states. However, it is pertinent to note that, some states are embroiled in crisis with multiple factions. These factions are not new to our politics, especially since the return of democracy in 1999. However, it is important to put into consideration, the consequences of these factions during and after elections. It is important to remind you that the ignoble creation of factions in our party in Rivers and Zamfara states cost the party the governorship elections in those states.”","Chief Whip of the senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has applauded President Muhammadu Buhari and Chairman, Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, for the postponement of the party’s national convention earlier scheduled for February 26.

"FG to spend N3.53trn on infrastructure, human capital development","From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja

Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, has said the Federal Government would spend estimated N3.53 trillion on infrastructure and human capital development in 2022.

She stated this during a town hall meeting organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture on the achievements of the Federal Government in infrastructure development in Abuja, yesterday.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The minister added that Nigeria’s economy and population remained the largest in Africa with over $400 billion in gross domestic product and over 200 million people.

She said the huge and growing population offered both an economic challenge and opportunity in the light of constrained revenue proceeds brought on by several multi-dimensional factors, including the global pandemic and its impact on the domestic economy.

Ahmed also said against the backdrop of the challenges, the current administration has successfully implemented a range of infrastructure programmes that have had a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of the citizenry.

She reiterated that quality infrastructure is important, not only to engender and accelerate economic growth, but also to ensure and enhance inclusive growth for all within a nation space.

Ahmed recalled that the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme (RITCS) was launched in 2019 to leverage private sector capital and expertise to construct, repair and maintain critical road infrastructure in key economic corridors and industrial clusters in Nigeria. She stated that the RITCS scheme was designed to complement and ameliorate the burden of funding significant capital outlays on road projects by the Federal Government.

Ahmed said as a model, the RITCS adopted the use of tax expenditures, via tax credits, to finance the construction of critical road and bridge infrastructure projects, while utilising an innovative PPP mechanism that is aimed at the incentivisation of private sector participation and capital investments.

“The Scheme commenced in 2019, with the president’s approval of 19 Road Projects covering 769.16 km and located in 11 states across the six geopolitical zones. Subsequently, construction commenced with the reconstruction of the Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota Road in Lagos State (34 km), re-construction of Obajana-Kabba road (43km) in Kogi State – both invested in and undertaken by Dangote Industries Limited, while the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited undertook the construction of the Bodo-Bonny road and the bridges across the Opobo channel in Rivers state (40 km).

“Since the inception of the RITCS, the president has approved 14 additional roads, bringing the total to thirty-three (33) Road Projects, covering a total length of 1,564.95 km as of 2021. These additional projects are in 19 States across the six (6) geo-political zones in the country. In the last three years (2019 – 2021), about N78 billion worth of tax credits have been issued to investors under the RITCS. In addition, the NNPC is to finance the construction of 21 roads across the country.”

On the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) Infrastructure Development Projects (NIF), Ahmed disclosed that over a period of seven years (2015 – 2021), the government invested and completed 13 projects across seven key sectors, including healthcare, education, agriculture, financial services, and housing.","From Aidoghie Paulinus, AbujaMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, has said the Federal Government would spend estimated N3.53 trillion on infrastructure and human capital development in 2022.

"Citing Emergence of Previous Chairmen, Buhari Okays Consensus for APC Convention","•El-Rufai denies division among colleagues

•Confirms they initially disagreed, but now on same page

•Party zones offices, adopts PDP formula, swaps positions between North and South

•Chairmanship goes to North-central, National Secretary South-west

Iyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, met with governors elected on the platform of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and okayed suggestions for a consensus option at the newly proposed March 26 national convention of the party.

Buhari met with the APC governors at the State House, Abuja, for about 15 minutes and discussed the current state of the party and the misgivings about its national convention. He noted that all former chairmen of APC, from Chief Bisi Akande, John Odigie-Oyegun, to Adams Oshiomhole, emerged through consensus.

But Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, dismissed insinuations that the 22 governors of APC and the Anambra State Deputy Governor were sharply divided over the date of the national convention, saying they merely disagreed. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen after the APC governors’ meeting with Buhari, however, noted that the governors had disagreed over the timing of the national convention, as some were of the belief that there were many unresolved issues. But he contended that they were all now on the same page.

El-Rufai said APC had adopted a formula, which was embraced by the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during its convention. Under the plan, APC would allow its northern and southern members swap positions from the ones held by the previous National Working Committee (NWC).

Judging by the copy of the zoning formula obtained by THISDAY last night, APC had resolved to have its national chairman come from the North-central, while conceding the office of National Secretary to the South-west.

Despite its recent challenges, Chairman of Northern States Governors’ Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, allayed concerns that the ruling party might collapse after Buhari’s tenure. Lalong believed APC would be stronger after the incumbent president.

El-Rufai, who was fielding questions from State House correspondents, said the governors had disagreed over the timing of the convention, because, “There were some governors that felt we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress issues in some states.

“As you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.

“Yes, there were differences in opinions about timing. Some of us are saying the constitution allows us to have convention even if three or four states have issues that are unresolved, while others are saying no, let us finish all the reconciliations and we do this convention. After all, there is no time limit for the convention as long as we do it before the time for the primaries.

“So, that was the difference. This is what the media has called divided governors. In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra State agreeing on any issue.

“We can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we are all on the same page.”

The Kaduna State governor also disclosed that APC had agreed on a zoning formula that would swap offices previously held between North and South.

By the arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last NWC will go to the South, and vice versa, in the coming dispensation.

El-Rufai affirmed that agreement had been reached on zoning.

He stated, “We have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south has had in the last NWC, and vice versa.

“It is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.”

Speaking also after their meeting with Buhari, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, revealed that Buhari was in favour of consensus in selecting candidates for party offices.

Bagudu said, “On consensus, Mr. President reminded us that we have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus: Baba Akande emerged as the pioneer chairman of the party by consensus; His Excellency, John Oyegun emerged by consensus; His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole emerged by consensus.

“So, he is a believer in consensus as one of the options for producing leadership, and he urged us to explore consensus, so that we can generate a list. While recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent, but knowing that just one person will occupy the office, consensus is part of our constitution, and he urged us to work towards consensus.

“And the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level; it’s almost certain that we will achieve it.

“Then, the date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday on their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have heard the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position.”

Bagudu explained that even though the planned zonal congresses of APC were not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.

According to him, “On proposed zonal congresses not in the constitution, I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday (Monday), there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn.

“So, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the constitution, particularly, how you do zonal congresses. And we have in the past done them with national convention, but nothing again in the constitution stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided.”

Asked if the APC governors were divided, Bagudu retorted, “Are governors divided? Not at all! The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President; we are appreciative of his leadership. We commend him for his leadership.

“We are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.”

On his part, Lalong maintained that the ruling party would not collapse after Buhari’s exit, saying, “I think that from the progress report read by our chairman, and from several assumptions, and also several reports that we are seeing what tremendous efforts the federal government is doing. We are already going around commissioning projects here and there in all the various states.

“There is no doubt, although, you are not specific as to which reason will make us not to come back again, but as far as we are concerned, based on assessment, and based on what the federal government is doing, there is every hope that this party, this government will move beyond our president and that is what he has been saying, that by the grace of God, this government will move beyond his tenure.”

Nineteen of the 22 APC governors were in attendance at the meeting held at the Council Chambers, which also had in attendance Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.

The governors in attendance were those of Yobe, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Cross River, Kaduna, Lagos, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Kano, Imo, Kogi, Ogun, Plateau and Anambra’s deputy governor.

Zoning Formula

According to the zoning formula obtained yesterday by THISDAY, APC has zoned its chairmanship position to North-central, which implies that the presidential ticket of the party might go to the south, in addition to the office of the National Secretary, which has been given to the South-west in specific.

Other positions zoned to the North-central are National Vice Chairman (NC), Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.

APC zoned the following positions to the South-south: National Vice Chairman (SS), National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader

The offices zoned to the South-west are National Secretary, National Vice Chairman (South-West), National Youth Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.

For the North-west, the positions given are National Vice Chairman (NW), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability – PWD) Leader, among others.

The party zoned the position of the Deputy National Chairman (S) to the South-east, with other offices like National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.

North-east would produce Deputy National Chairman (N), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (NW), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, among others.

Interestingly, the zoning plan has tactically knocked out a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and Sunny Monidafe.

The chairmanship aspirants favoured by the method are the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Musa; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; and former governors of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura and Abdudulahi Adamu.

Buni Threatens to Resign

But while APC may have succeeded in dousing the raging issues over its national convention, a new problem seems to be developing.

An insider told THISDAY last night that the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had threatened to resign his position, citing accusations of inefficiency from many APC governors accused.

The source said regarding Buni, “While some of the governors were ready to grab his resignation, others cautioned that accepting his resignation would draw the party back. And on the basis of that, the governors encouraged him to continue until the national convention is held.”

However, while the governors and the president agreed to swap offices between North and South, THISDAY gathered that the leaders of the party specifically agreed that the national chairman should go to the North-central.

According to the source, while the party’s leaders agreed on consensus option in electing the national officers, the governors agreed that the president should be given the privilege to pick the national chairman.

Thus, ahead of the national convention on March 26, the meeting yesterday also agreed to hold national caucus meeting to resolve all pending issues.

"Amid Raging Controversies At Home, Buhari's Minister, Abubakar Malami Jets Out To US","Nigeria's Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, is currently the United States of America amid many controversies, SaharaReporters has gathered.

The minister on Monday night ‘secretly’ travelled out of Lagos on Delta Airline 55 (DL0055) and arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Tuesday morning.

Abubakar Malami

Malami however had a stopover at Atlanta, capital of the U.S. state of Georgia.

He is expected back to the country on Saturday, February 26, 2022, by 9:20 am.

Though the reason why the minister is in the US is not clear, sources said it might be connected to the 2023 presidential election.

SaharaReporters has exclusively reported how a cabal led by Malami is strongly behind the push for the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, ahead of other strong contenders in the party. See Also Politics EXCLUSIVE: Story Behind How Buhari’s Minister, Malami, Media Guru, Obaigbena, Other Cabal Members Are Pushing Central Bank Governor, Emefiele’s Presidential Bid

A top source in the party had said that the “APC (All Progressives Congress) is torn between (Yemi) Osinbajo, (Bola) Tinubu and Emefiele’s people, each pushing their own candidate and agenda”.

A few weeks ago, Emefiele’s supporters, mainly youths, spotting white T-Shirts with the inscription MEFFY 2023, had at an occasion held in Lagos asked him to contest.

Convener of the group, Wale Fapohunda, told the gathering that since Emefiele’s appointment as CBN Governor, he had spent his energy building a resilient financial system that can serve the development needs of the economy, ignoring the glaring fact that Nigeria’s economy has dipped to its worst state ever during his tenure as CBN governor.

“The cabal led by AGF, Malami told Buhari they’ve settled for a Technocrat. This came after rejecting the President of African Development Bank, Akinwunmi Adesina, and (Nduka) Obaigbena is spearheading this,” a source had told SaharaReporters.

Malami, a lawyer from Kebbi State who was hardly known before 2015 when he was appointed into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, is today one of the richest men in Nigeria.

A series of detailed investigations carried out by SaharaReporters in 2020 showed that the Nigerian Chief Law Officer had acquired several properties whose value runs into billions of naira since being appointed by Buhari.

For example, the AGF has an underground hotel in Sokoto, three houses at Peace Estate, Abuja, a brand new state-of-the-art school in Kebbi, two houses for his sons worth N100 million each, and a new hotel under construction in the Jabi area of Abuja.

Malami also bought a house in 2020 worth N150 million in the Gwarimpa area of Abuja.

A newly constructed school is located at the back of NITEL in Gesse Phase 1, Birnin-Kebbi and a new house worth N600 million on Ahmadu Bello Way, Nasarawa GRA, Kano, are among properties acquired by Malami since he became a minister under President Buhari.

That is not all, Malami also built a N3 billion multipurpose event centre in Kebbi state named Azbir Arena for his son in Kebbi.

This is apart from Rayhaan Hotel located on Zaria Road, opposite Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, which the AGF massively upgraded.

Ever since SaharaReporters published a series of detailed reports exposing these illicit acquisitions, the online news medium has been a target for the AGF’s camp.

Apart from falsely claiming to have sued SaharaReporters over the expository reports he said had damaged his reputation before the world, Malami also issued a petition to the former Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on the issue, seeking the arrest of the Publisher of the online newspaper, Omoyele Sowore.

Despite the open display of unexplained wealth by the AGF and members of his family in recent times, President Buhari, who rode to power in 2015 on the back of a promise to crush corruption, especially in the government circle, has yet to offer any statement on the development.

SaharaReporters on Tuesday reported that a petition was sent to the Independent Corrupt Practice and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), calling for a probe into over N104 million which is missing from the office of the Attorney General, Malami.

The petition, started by the Integrity and Transparency Watch (ITW), a Nigerian non-profit organisation and society watchdog, urged the ICPC to investigate and prosecute the director of finance and account in the Ministry of Justice, Joshua Luka Kadmi who is in Grade Level 17 and one Abuh Danjuma who also works in the AGF's office.

The petition, dated February 15, 2022, was addressed to the ICPC Chairman, Bolaji Owasanoye by Shaibu Sodangi, the National Coordinator and Head of ITW's Investigation Department.

"EXTRA: Power failure is a thing of the past, says minister","Goddy Jedy Agba, minister of state for power, says power failure is a thing of the past in the country.

But Nigeria is still experiencing major power supply cuts.

Speaking at a town hall meeting in Abuja on Tuesday, Agba said by the end of the year, 85 percent of the citizens will have access to electricity.

The town hall meeting, organised by the federal ministry of information and culture, was meant to showcase the achievements of the Buhari administration on infrastructure development.

The minister said the federal government is working hard to ensure that all houses are metered in the country.

“Power failure is a thing of the past,” he said.

“By the end of the year, 85 percent of Nigerians will have electricity. Also, all the houses will be metered – you will only pay for what you consume.”

According to him, many of the power projects started by the federal government will be completed before the end of Buhari’s tenure.

On his part, Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, said his ministry is managing over 1,019 contracts involving 958 bridges and road projects across the country.

Fashola said roads are “critical infrastructure” necessary to develop the country.

“President Muhammadu Buhari clearly understands the necessity to invest in infrastructure, not just to support a growing population but as an economic driver,” the minister said.

“It is, therefore, not surprising that, through the federal ministry of works and housing, we are managing over 1,019 contracts involving 958 Bridges and Road Projects as we are also constructing houses in 34 states of the federation as well as new federal secretariats in Anambra, Nasarawa, Bayelsa , Zamfara, Osun and Ekiti states.”","Goddy Jedy Agba, minister of state for power, says power failure is a thing of the past in the country.

Wale Okediran: Bola Ige never taxed his political mentees -- he didn't make himself a godfather,"Wale Okediran, former member of the house of representatives, says Bola Ige, former attorney-general of the federation, was a respected mentor who did not portray himself as a political godfather.

Ige, who was the attorney-general of the federation under the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, was killed on December 23, 2001.

Speaking in an interview on ‘Parrot Xtra/Ayekooto’, a programme on Splash 105.5FM, Okediran said the late attorney-general groomed his mentees without harassment and threats.

The former lawmaker said he started out as a personal physician to Ige before he was persuaded by him to join partisan politics.

“Bola Ige was a mentor and he never behaved, conducted or portrayed himself as a godfather. He was my mentor and he was well respected by me. He was the one who persuaded me and the likes of Professor Sola Adeyeye to join politics,” he said.

“He was a respected politician and once he had groomed you, he would not harass or torment his mentees to bring him proceeds or threaten them with second term. He was a leader of leaders.

“I met Chief Bola Ige at his home during one of the meetings of our Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA). He was one of us because he had books he wrote and published.

“One day, he interviewed me to know more about me and I told him that I am a medical practitioner. He was thrilled. He then declared that he was appointing me as his personal physician.

“I accepted and along the line, I started to follow him to political meetings and campaigns. Their meetings used to amuse me and I used to laugh.

“He noticed and asked me what I felt about joining politics. He then encouraged me saying we professionals should not keep away from partisan politics.

We’re discussing how to spot NFT scams and MarketForce’s $40 million war chest.

How to spot NFT scams















Over the last few years, blockchain technology has shot into the limelight. With its promise of anonymity and speedy transactions not limited by national borders, there has been no shortage of adopters and even evangelists.

But that’s not all we have to thank the blockchain for, with NFTs generating almost as much attention as the technology. Where artists had to wait for their work to be commissioned — often by individuals in the same geographical location — they can now create and sell art for astonishing prices. Admittedly, art is not the only use case for NFTs, but it is currently the most popular.

With the often mind-boggling prices NFTs sell for, it is perhaps no surprise that they have been used in fraudulent activities, with wash trading and money laundering the most common cases.

Ideally, we would expect governments to curb these issues, but NFTs are not regarded as securities, and it has become difficult to establish what is a scam. Fortunately, our reporter, Bolu Abiodun has some tips on identifying NFT scams, and you can read all about it in Wash trading scams and money laundering; why NFT traders should be careful.

MarketForce raises $40 million to provide BNPL to merchants













MarketForce co-founders. Source: TechCrunch

Most African households depend on informal retailers for their supplies. As tech eased operations in other industries, a few entrepreneurs built solutions for the eCommerce space.

Initially, these solutions were B2C, but in the last few years, the focus seems to have shifted to serving the small businesses that drive commerce on the continent.

One of the players in this industry – MarketForce – has raised a $40 million Series A to offer buy now, pay later (BNPL) services to its customers.

V8 Capital Partners led the round, with Cellulant Co-founder, Ken Njoroge, Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, Vu Ventures, Vastly Valuable Ventures, Uncovered Fund, Reflect Ventures, Greenhouse Capital, Century Oak Capital, and Remapped Ventures participating.

Last year, the startup raised $2 million in a pre-Series A round, including $150,000 from Y Combinator. Following that, it launched in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. At the time, it had just launched RejaReja to enable retailers to get next-day deliveries for products.

With its latest raise, the startup plans to grow its team to 800 while growing the number of merchants on RejaReja to 250,000 in the next few months.

MarketForce is not the only startup digitising the informal retail experience, with TradeDepot, SokoWatch, Omnibiz, and Alerzo doing the same.

With low spending power and a lack of proper addressing systems limiting B2C startups, the focus has shifted to B2B. Yet, there remains a vast market opportunity for startups. A 2020 report by the International Trade Center found that ten countries accounted for 94% of all online businesses in Africa. As mobile and Internet penetration increases on the continent, more countries could get a piece of the eCommerce pie.

MTN goes tech: How data overtook voice revenue,"Last Wednesday, Africa’s largest telecommunications company, MTN, took an important step towards its ambition of becoming a full-fledged technology company and the biggest digital platform on the continent by 2025, with the unveiling of a new logo.

The logo is coming ahead of a re-branding event set to take place on Monday, February 28, 2022.

While the new logo retained the iconic yellow colour, the oval-shaped blue background with a red accent was replaced with an oval MTN in black lettering. It is a logo that is supposed to communicate the company’s new transition – from telco to tech.

Anyone who has followed recent developments in the company would not be surprised MTN is making the transition formal. It has been long in coming with the recruitment of Adia Sowho, the former interim CEO of Thrive Agric and a well-known face in the tech ecosystem.

MTN has been on a strong push in recent years to diversify its business, pursuing new revenue streams in mobile data, technology, and related communications services to businesses, wholesale network services, fintech, and digital services.

MTN is also in the job market looking to recruit 150 digital experts to ensure it keeps pace with growing digital demand.

According to the company, the move ties with MTN Group’s 2025 ambition.

“We intend to lead the delivery of a bold new digital world and are therefore looking to expand our teams to ensure we keep challenging what we do to always do better,” said Tebogo Maenetja, chief of human resources at MTN South Africa.

Some of the roles MTN wants to fill include UX and UI designers; product owners; performance marketers; digital content specialists; eCommerce experts; full-stack developers; scrum masters, and business analysts.

The telco’s intensity is coming from impressive growth in the data business. In 2021, MTN reported active data subscribers growth of 5.3 percent year-on-year to 34.3 million compared to its voice business, which declined by 10.6 percent in the same year due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations.

The growth in active data subscribers also reflected in the revenue, which rose to 55.3 percent in 2021, maintaining an accelerated growth trajectory in the fourth quarter as it continues to accelerate the expansion of its 4G coverage, enhance the quality and capacity of the network to support increasing data traffic, and grow active data users. The company also saw an average megabit (MB) per user grow by 62.7 percent, enabling overall data traffic growth of 85.3 percent. The telco claims its 4G network now covers 70.3 percent of the population, up from 60.1 percent in December 2020.

Voice revenue was not so impressive as it grew by only 8.4 percent year-on-year in 2021. The company’s fintech business rose by 57.3 percent due to sustained growth in the use of Xtratime products and broader fintech services by users.

MTN also expanded its MoMo agent network, through a one distribution strategy, with the addition of over 374,000 registered agents, bringing the total number to approximately 770,000, up to 94.8 percent. The growth led to transaction volume rising by 167.0 percent to 137.5 million from an active user base of 9.4 million, up 102 percent.

Experts say that for most telecom operators like MTN the shift to becoming full-fledged technology companies is driven by current economic realities and the influx of new disruptors that have seen most incumbents struggle to maintain their market leadership. In some cases, the new disruptors have swallowed supposed big old players.

In a recent report, Mckinsey noted that even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, telecom operators had been battling a decade-long disruption, one of which is the customer-back disruption led by digital natives such as Uber and Netflix. These digital natives set new standards for seamless online experiences that forced incumbents to redefine their interaction models.

There is also business-model disruption with technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and the internet of things rewriting the rules in service delivery and value-capture models. The telcos also faced the new-entrant disruption, which led to increased competition among traditional players as well as non-traditional players. This disruption has now shifted value toward technology-focused parts of the value chain.

“Most operators responded to these daunting challenges with a mix of efficiency measures, digitisation efforts, structural changes (such as network sharing), and productivity improvements,” the Mckinsey report noted. “In parallel, many expanded into new industries, such as TV and information and communications technology (ICT), to increase revenue streams. As demonstrated by pre-COVID-19 performance, though, that formula has been running out of steam.”

In the case of MTN, the disruptions drove the launch of new business verticals, most of which were aimed at increasing data consumption on the network. Generally, internet data consumption has been on the increase in Nigeria. The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) had in 2021 noted the huge demand for data.

“Nigerians are consuming in excess of 80,000 terabytes of data every month,” said Garba Umar Danbatta, executive vice-chairman, NCC, noting, “We have seen this trend for a while, with an increase in data usage associated with an increase in online activity.”

In Africa, Nigeria’s monthly data consumption of 80,000 terabytes (80m GB) is only surpassed by South Africa, which consumes about 269,000TB every month. Kenya and Ghana complete the four largest consumers, using 22,400TB and 8,100TB of monthly internet data, respectively.

With people consuming more data than calls, it is no surprise therefore that MTN is prioritising the former over the latter. Importantly, the company knows it needs to provide different services to ensure more people consume its data service.

In 2019 for instance, MTN launched its music streaming service, MusicTime, which it developed in partnership with Simfy Africa. The music streaming app, first introduced in South Africa in 2018, allows users to buy time on the service, data inclusive, as opposed to other streaming services that allow users to do a monthly subscription. However, the app is missing from the Play Store.

Other verticals launched by the company include Ayoba, MoMo, and recently a microinsurance service called AYo, which is already launched in Ghana, Uganda, and Zambia.

According to a BusinessDay report, AYo started out as a 50-50 partnership between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH). Over the past two years, MMH took its stake down to 25 percent before completely exiting the venture, leaving MTN as the sole owner.

“I believe part of what is driving the company’s decision is borne out of the fact that currently, they provide telecom support services that power Africa’s tech ecosystem,” noted Omosomi Omomia, a manager at KPMG. “MTN has over 277 million subscribers in over 20 African countries with Nigeria and South Africa being the largest market. Interestingly, MTN has business interests in tech but their core business revolves around providing telecom services such as voice and data services.”

Omomia said MTN would need to consolidate its different businesses into a single entity that could in no distant time begin to rival global tech companies like Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, and Alphabet’s Google.

MTN’s next big play is the launch of 5G in Nigeria. 5G even gives the company a massive advantage to grow its data market share. It is already among the companies in South Africa with the 5G licence and is deploying at speed.

In Nigeria, the company has already paid the $273 million licence fee and is waiting for the regulator NCC to make it official on February 24. It has also closed funding, which it plans to use to fund its infrastructure across the country.","MTN has been on a strong push in recent years to diversify its business, pursuing new revenue streams in mobile data, technology, and related communications services to businesses, wholesale network services, fintech, and digital services.

Five digital products propelling MTN towards tech,"MTN has been growing alternative sources of revenue outside voice, maintaining an accelerated growth trajectory, with massive adoption of its data, fintech, and digital services.

Its digital platforms provide services that expose and leverage its connectivity and payment capabilities as well as foster an ecosystem to help drive local innovation.

BusinessDay takes a look at five digital products propelling MTN towards being a technology company.

MoMo

MoMo is an acronym for mobile money, which allows registered agents to perform transactions for customers. It also allows cash transfers for people who do not have bank accounts and ATM cards.

This initiative by MTN is to ensure a secure electronic service linked to an MTN mobile phone number that enables the mobile operator’s Mobile Money wallet holders to store funds, send and receive money, make payments and do a number of other transactions simply using their mobile phone.

MoMo is used to send money to any MTN mobile phone user, registered or not, as well as to mobile phone users on other local networks. Also, it is used to withdraw cash at any authorised MTN Mobile Money agent, top-up MTN airtime, pay bills, buy and pay for insurance, payment of employee salaries, airline tickets, school fees, and other goods and services.

In November 2018, MTN MoMo launched in Uganda, and by May 2021, the programme was live across 12 African countries including Nigeria, with over 22 million subscribers in 15 countries.

While MTN currently awaits final approval on a payment service bank (PSB) licence that will enable it to deploy MoMo as a mobile money service in Nigeria, the company in an interview with BusinessDay said it planned to separate the business from its telco business in the country.

Ayoba

Ayoba is a free instant messaging app, built by MTN for Africans. The platform offers users free access to an ecosystem of digital and media services through chat and call features, channels, micro-apps, and payment solutions.

Ayoba is localised and tailored for African and Middle East consumer needs, supporting 22 relevant languages. It has incorporated sophisticated end-to-end encryption to keep its users’ data safe and ensure their privacy.

This means that messages in a conversation cannot be read by anyone else, not even the team at Ayoba. MTN’s inclusive approach to technology entails that Ayoba users will be able to communicate with anyone with a mobile device, even if they don’t have the Ayoba app yet.

Founded two years ago, Ayoba has reached a milestone of over 10 million monthly active users, with over 180 content channels ranging from sports news, music and artists, health and wellness, careers, fashion, and beauty, as well as education and travel.

RBM

RBM uses the rich and interactive features of rich communication services (RCS), which is the next generation SMS that allows sharing of audio, video, images, location, among others, to enable branded business messaging.

RCS messages are securely delivered to native messaging apps such as Google and Samsung messages on android phones. Available on 3G and 4G networks, RCS is the default messaging standard for 5G networks.

As of today, RCS is available globally with over 700 million monthly active users. In partnership with Google and Dotgo, MTN would leverage the services provided by Dotgo such as the RCS application programme interface (APIs), including chatbot directory, billing, payments, reconciliation, among others, to drive monetisation from RCS.

Insurance platform

MTN’s insurance platform is a solution that monitors driving behaviour and statistics to enable usage-based insurance.

The solution, developed by MTN Business in conjunction with technology partner Huawei, involves the installation of an on-board diagnostic (OBD) device that can feed information to the driver’s mobile phone and to a data centre for use by the insurance fleet management companies.

It monitors driving statistics, driver behaviour, and the state of the vehicle, enabling insurance companies to offer usage-based policies that are based on collected and analysed data.

According to the company, the service will initially use MTN’s 3G and 2G networks for connectivity but will ultimately use the NB-IoT network that the operator is building out with Huawei.

Music streaming app

MTN has a fully inclusive time-based music streaming service that offers users trending and locally relevant music through partnerships with music labels and providers.

The service, which is an offering from the team at Simfy Africa, is set to revolutionise Africa’s music industry with a fully inclusive music streaming offering that includes a countdown timer, top trending music, and data included in the price.

The service works based on a timer clock that counts down as users listen to music, and there is no subscription needed. Being an app in South Africa, MusicTime is available as either: 120 minutes for R5 or 300 minutes for R10, and both packages are valid for seven days from purchase.

Users can listen to the music with no hidden data costs, advertisements, or other interruptions.","BusinessDay takes a look at five digital products propelling MTN towards being a technology company.

African Leaders Must Learn To Work With Good People In Opposition Parties – Jonathan,"Former President Goodluck Jonathan and Chairman of the ECOWAS Council of the Wise( CoW) on Tuesday said it is high time African leaders realised that once they win election to become president of their country, they should see themselves as president to all, not to a section of the country.

Dr. Jonathan who is also the chief mediator on the crisis in Mali while briefing the press in Lagos of the activities of his council said one of the key pillars of the ECOWAS Peace and Security Architecture, the Council is involved in is preventive diplomacy and mediation interventions in regional conflict management, resolution and prevention.

He noted that, the major challenges African leaders are having is that they have chosen not to work with members of the opposition parties while in office, because they see them as enemies.

“Immediately you win the election you must be the president of everybody. And if we practice that and begin to work with every good citizen in the country that has something to offer then some of these conflicts that are somehow politically related or instigated will begin to go down.

“It is not going to be a one-day business, it is going to be a business that we will do for one year. Other members will take over and maybe they will modify our action plan and also move on. And if we continue to practice that for a period of five years to 10 years I believe some of these practices that are catalysing these crises in the sub-region will begin to go down,” Jonathan said.

According to him, as part of a strategy to put the development of the region in a fast lane, he said that the region was reconsidering re-capitalizing its regional bank.

“We also looked at some other things like, we have recommended that the ECOWAS Bank of Investment and Development should be capitalised properly and restructure it so that it will play a key role in assisting people in the private sector to build small and medium scale industries across the sub region. That will increase the opportunity of young people getting loans to develop businesses and also create jobs for others. ‘’

"Buhari delivers 3 major projects too hard for Obasanjo, Jonathan","By Rotimi Ijikanmi

President Muhammadu Buhari administration has delivered three critical infrastructure projects, which for decades defied solutions from past administrations of Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan.

The Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola listed the projects on Tuesday in Abuja at the 21st edition of Town Hall Meeting focusing on the achievements of the Federal Government in Infrastructure Development.

The town hall meeting was organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Orientation Agency (NOA).

In a presentation, Fashola said that Apapa-Oworonshoki road in Lagos state which was notorious for gridlock and in bad shape for decades was one of the difficult projects.

He said the road built in 1970 had failed intermittently and seemed to have defied solution in the history of the country.

Fashola said Buhari found solution to the critical infrastructure with the construction of a new 37 km road from Apapa Port to the Toll Gate which would last for at least 50 years after completion.

The minister also identified Bodo-Bonny Bridge in Rivers which was the only access to the site of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas.

“For decades, this place is only accessible by air and when there is bad weather which are a usual occurrence people cannot get there for days.

“Three attempts had been made by the previous administrations to construct the bridge but all failed,’’ he said.

Fashola said the Buhari administration succeeded in constructing the first road and bridge linking Bonny Island in highly challenging environment and soil condition

The third project according to Fashola is the Second Niger Bridge which he said would be delivered and inaugurated before the end of the year.

The minister said the second Niger Bridge had always come up as an election statement by past administrations and nothing happened until Buhari broke the jinx.

The minister said the administration awarded 1,019 infrastructure contracts covering 859 projects across the country and no state was left out without benefitting from the projects.

He said the administration also took an initiative to fix roads inside federal tertiary institutions and the impact had really worth the efforts.

“We are in 76 federal tertiary institutions we have completed and commission 29 and starting a round of 22 last year before the ASUU strike.

“Our promise of change as a party and government is manifesting in the area of road transport infrastructure

“The money we borrowed is being invested in all part of Nigeria and it is driving growth,’’ he said.","By Rotimi IjikanmiPresident Muhammadu Buhari administration has delivered three critical infrastructure projects, which for decades defied solutions from past administrations of Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan.

EU to admit travellers jabbed with WHO-approved shots,"European Union countries agreed on Tuesday to open their borders to travellers from outside the bloc who have had shots against COVID-19 authorised by the World Health Organization.

This move will ease restrictions on those who received Indian and Chinese vaccines.

The EU has so far authorised vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca (when produced in Europe), Johnson & Johnson and Novavax.

In addition to these shots, the WHO has also approved the vaccines produced by Chinese makers Sinopharm and Sinovac and by Indian company Bharat Biotech.

It has also authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India by the Serum Institute.

Until now, most EU countries have not admitted people from outside the bloc travelling for non-essential reasons if they have been vaccinated with shots not approved in the EU.

“Member states should lift the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU for persons vaccinated with an EU- or WHO-approved vaccine,” said a recommendation adopted on Tuesday by EU governments which would be applicable from March 1.

Restrictions will be lifted for travellers who received the final dose of the primary vaccination cycle at least 14 days and no more than 270 days before arrival. Boosted travellers will also be accepted.

EU states also agreed to lift a temporary restriction on non-essential travel for people who have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days prior to travelling to the EU.

For people inoculated with a WHO-approved vaccine, EU states could also require a negative PCR test taken at the earliest 72 hours before departure and could apply additional measures such as quarantine or isolation.","The EU has so far authorised vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca (when produced in Europe), Johnson & Johnson and Novavax.

Confirming the incident, Mrs Olayinka Ajayi, the Treasurer, Landlord Association in the community, told newsmen that she was one of the victims.

Ajayi claimed she was rushed to the hospital, adding that she was restored to life with inhaler when she could not breathe properly after inhaling the smoke.

She said the best option was to relocate the dumpsite from the community.

According to her, it has subjected residents of the community to various health hazards.

"Leaked Audio: How Zamfara Governor, Matawalle Wastes Taxpayers’ Money, Lures Relatives Of Political Opponent With N20 Million","According to leaked recordings, Bello Matawalle, the governor of Zamfara State, lavished N20 million on five relatives of Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa, a former federal legislator, in an apparent attempt to win them over.

At the time, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State was split into two factions, according to SaharaReporters.

One party swore allegiance to Governor Matawalle, while the other rallied to Marafa’s camp.

Matawalle switched from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the African Progressive Congress (APC) in June 2021.

In an audio clip obtained by SaharaReporters, roughly five Marafa relatives were overheard in Hausa discussing how the governor enticed them with N20 million.

According to them, the governor instructed them to inform the public that the former lawmaker failed to assist members of his family and promised to compensate them if they completed the task.

They were also overheard discussing how they split N1 million while waiting for the remaining N19 million.

“Are you aware that the N20 million has been set aside by the governor for us? We have shared the N1 million while waiting for the balance of N19 million. Our list has been submitted to the governor. We will join his camp,” one of them said in the audio.

However, one of them, Alhaji Sanusi Mayana Gusau, the lawmaker’s uncle, warned the other, saying they should be careful of the dangers of ingratitude.

Marafa, he claimed, had done and was still doing a lot to empower and help many family members.

He claimed that Marafa, whom the governor was attacking with government money, provided the vehicle and even the clothing that the five relatives drove and wore to the Government House.

Marafa is a descendant of Sambo Dan Ashafa, the founder of Gusau, the current capital of Zamfara State.

When SaharaReporters approached Zailani Bappa, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Enlightenment, Media, and Communications, for comment, he claimed the recording was made by the state’s opposition.

“Do you remember the alleged audio of former Inspector General of Police on the Security Report in the state? Was it not later debunked as bunkum by the same former IG where he distanced himself from the alleged audio?

“This is the style of the opposition in Zamfara state….trumped-up,” he said.","According to leaked recordings, Bello Matawalle, the governor of Zamfara State, lavished N20 million on five relatives of Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa, a former federal legislator, in an apparent attempt to win them over.

"Abia Killing Meant To Provoke North, Don’t Retaliate — Islamic Group Tells Muslim Traders","The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has reacted to the assassination of Northern businessmen in an Abia State cattle market.

MURIC advised Northerners not to retaliate in Abia State, where roughly eight traders and cows were slain last week.

The call, according to the Islamic organisation, is intended to ensure that peace reigns in the country.

The event occurred at Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of the State, at the New Cattle Market.

The organization claimed, however, that the killing was done to irritate the North.

A statement by MURIC’s Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, said: “About fifteen (15) Northern traders and 150 cows belonging to the victims were killed in Abia State last week. The killings occurred on Tuesday, 15th February, 2022 at the New Cattle Market in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of the state.

“Although we are aware that this is not the first time such dastardly act would occur in South-Eastern Nigeria, we strongly appeal to Northerners not to contemplate retaliation. Our main reason for the appeal is the need for peace in the country at this point in time when we are approaching the end of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.

“We charge Northerners to remain patient and law-abiding. This attack in Abia in particular was intended to provoke the North into counter-killings which may spiral into another orgy of violence culminating in a civil war. The North should not even bite the bait, talk less of swallowing it. The cost is too high.

“Our records show that this has occurred several times particularly in the last seven years without the North attempting to retaliate once. We salute both the Northern youths and elders and urge them to hold on and continue the display of maturity and reticence.”","The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has reacted to the assassination of Northern businessmen in an Abia State cattle market.

"APC Chairmanship: Consensus our best option, Buhari declares","Ahead of its March 26, 2022 national convention, President Muhammadu Buhari has urged governors and chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to explore the option of getting a consensus chairman to run the party’s affairs.

Chairman of the APC Governors Forum and Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu said this Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents at the end of a meeting between the APC governors and President Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.

“President Buhari is a believer in consensus as one of the options of producing leaders and he urged us to explore consensus while recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent but only one person will occupy the office at the end of the day. Consensus is part of our constitution and he urged us to work towards consensus.

“We have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus; Bisi Akande emerge as the pioneer chairman of the APC through consensus, John Oyegun emerged by consensus, Adama Oshiomhole emerged by consensus. So, the president reminded us of that.

“And the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level it’s almost certain that we will achieve it,” he said.

He said the APC governors had officially informed the president of the new date for the party’s national convention where officials are expected to be elected.

“The date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday of their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have had that, we have had the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position,” he said.

On the proposed zonal congresses which many argued have no provisions in the party’s constitution, the governor said all available options would be looked into.

“I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday, there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn. So, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the Constitution.

“Particularly, how you do zonal congresses? And we have in the past done them with National Convention, but nothing again in the constitution, stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided,” the governor said.

He said contrary to insinuations in some quarters, the APC governors are not divided.

“Are governors divided? Not at all, the 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President, we are appreciative of his leadership, we commend him for his leadership. We are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day,” he said.

Also speaking, Kaduna state Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai said the governors were hitherto divided on the issue of timing for the national convention.

“We were divided over the timing of the convention. Some governors felt we should not have the convention until we resolved all the congresses issues in some states because in some of the states, these matters are even in court.

“So some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved and that was not borne out of any agenda or selfish interest but just a realistic position to avoid violating any laws or putting our party structures or elected candidates in problem in future.

“But after our meeting last night to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee and our briefing with the president today, we are all on the same page,” he said.

He said the APC had resolved the zoning formula to be used for national offices of the party.

“We have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones and essentially, we swapped the positions such that now northern zone will take positions that the southern zone had in the last eight years and vice-versa.

“It is a very simple, equitable and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of preparing for the convention that will start in earnest,”he said.

Also speaking, Plateau state Governor Simon Bako Lalong said the APC would outlive the tenure of President Buhari by remaining in power beyond 2023.

Okorocha

In a related development, the immediate past governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha has proffered solution to the crisis rocking the APC over repeatedly postponed national convention.

Okorocha, who spoke to Senate correspondents after plenary Tuesday, specifically suggested that founding leaders of the party across the original four blocks should be allowed to nominate interested party members for sensitive positions such as national chairman, secretary, women leader, youth leader, organising secretary etc.

He said while President Buhari as leader of the Congress for Progress Change (CPC) bloc should be given the honour of deciding who becomes the next national chairman of the party , others like Senator Bola Tinubu of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria(ACN), Ogbonnaya Onu of the defunct All Nigeria People’s Party(ANPP) , himself as leader of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) faction then, should also be giving the honour of picking the national secretary and other important positions.

Sharing the party’s positions on that basis, he added , would help in preventing the ship of the party from hitting the rock.

He said: “Our party is a great party, APC is a great party, what is wrong with our party is that we have forgotten how we all started, we should not make the mistake of PDP of the old and I think that will be corrected with the party’s Convention now slated for March 26 , 2022.

“What we need to do is to go back to basics so that we adhere to the culture of unity and equity the party was known for at formation in 2013.

“There were four political parties that formed APC. CPC led by the former Head of State, Muhammadu Buhari who is now the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu came with ACN , Governor Abdulaziz Yari , Senator Ali Modu Sheriff (SAS) and former governor of Ebonyi state, Ogbonaya Onu who is now Minister of Science and Technology and Rochas Okorocha leading the APGA.

“Our initial position was that all positions would be shared among these four parties and DPP that came with few members and after the merger, the new PDP joined.

“Now, the wisest thing for all of us to do is to go back to the founding basis and distribute the political positions as we did it that time and there will be no rancour and it will be very peaceful.

“The father of the party now is President Muhammadu Buhari who should be given that respect to pick the person that will hold sensitive position in the party as Chairman, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu should always be made to produce some key positions in the party and the other parties and should also be made to have positions and when this is done there will be no problem in APC.

“But if we go into election at this time and of course it will open a Pandora of litigations because where 1000 people buy nominations form, APC can make an income of N2 billion on sales of forms and after that, APC can spend N3 billion on litigations.

“So the wise thing to do is to call the founding fathers of the party and give them key positions and carry everyone along, including the new people that joined the party.”","Chairman of the APC Governors Forum and Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu said this Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents at the end of a meeting between the APC governors and President Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.

BREAKING: Aisha Buhari Attends Plenary At National Assembly,"The First Lady, Mrs Aisha Buhari, on Wednesday attended the plenary sessions in both chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Mrs Buhari was at the National Assembly to throw her weight behind an item for amendment in the 1999 Constitution which seeks specific seats to be created for female legislators in the country.

She was accompanied to Senate Chamber by the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen; and the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed.

The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in a short remark after the report was laid by Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege said the visit by the First Lady was to show support for a bill to have more female parliamentarians at the federal and state legislatures.

“The First Lady’s visit is to show support for a bill for more female parliamentarians in both chambers in the Senate and the House and the State Legislatures.

“This, we believe, will help in nation building as such significant participation by our women will add value to not only legislation but the much desired and needed national development.

“For us as a nation, our motto is Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress. We believe that all hands must be on deck to ensure the participation of each and every segment of our society,” Lawan said.

UPDATED: Signing Of Electoral Act Amendment Bill Postponed Till Friday,"President Muhammadu Buhari will now sign the re-worked Electoral Act Amendment Bill on Friday, February 25.

A source close to the Presidency, who had earlier indicated that the President would assent to the bill on Wednesday, confirmed the new date to Channels Television.

According to the source, the new date will be honoured by the President.

This comes at a time when President Buhari presides over the Federal Executive Council meeting held at the State House in Abuja.

READ ALSO: Buhari To Sign Electoral Bill In A Matter Of Hours – Adesina

On January 25, lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives chambers of the National Assembly passed the harmonised version of the bill.

The harmonised version was received by President Buhari a week later, as confirmed by his Senior Special Assistant on NASS Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare.

He withheld his assent to the bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political players as part of the reasons for his decision.

But the President gave some conditions to give his assent – an action that prompted the lawmakers to re-work the bill, leading to the emergence of two versions in the green and red chambers.

The House had re-amended the bill to include the direct and indirect primary options while the Senate re-adjusted it to include the direct, indirect, and consensus modes of selecting political parties’ candidates.

Both chambers later passed the harmonised version – the final agreed version of the amendment to Clause 84 which included the direct, indirect, and consensus primary modes.

Amid an outcry from critics who raised concerns about the delayed signing over fears that the President might reject the bill again, a presidential aide, Femi Adesina, said his principal’s action was within the requirements of the law.

He stated that it would only be appropriate to say President Buhari has acted against the law if he exceeds the 30-day window provided by the Constitution to take a decision on the bill.

“It could be signed today; it could be signed tomorrow. In a matter of hours, not days. Hours could be 24 hours, it could be 48 hours; not days, not weeks,” Adesina had said on Tuesday’s edition of Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily.","President Muhammadu Buhari will now sign the re-worked Electoral Act Amendment Bill on Friday, February 25.

Russia ‘Highly Likely’ To Attack Kyiv – UK,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is highly likely to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and attack Kyiv, UK foreign minister Liz Truss said Wednesday.

The UK and US have repeatedly over the last weeks cited intelligence as indicating that Russia is planning an invasion of Ukraine.

“We think it’s highly likely that he (Putin) will follow through on his plan for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine”, Truss told Sky News.

Asked if the Russian leader would move on the capital Kyiv, she said: “We think it’s highly likely that that is in his plans.”

While Putin has said he is sending troops, “we don’t yet have the full evidence that that has taken place”, Truss said, calling the current situation “ambiguous”.

Truss held frosty talks earlier this month with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced the first tranche of UK sanctions targeting five Russian banks and three billionaire oligarchs.

Truss said Wednesday that the UK needed to “retain some sanctions in the locker” and had “more individuals that we will target in the event of a full-scale invasion”.

"Strike: FG’s Meeting With ASUU Ends Inconclusive, Negotiation Rescheduled","The reconciliatory meeting between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities has ended inconclusively.

Amid a warning strike declared by the lecturers, both parties failed to reach an agreement at the meeting held on Tuesday in Abuja.

The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, who convened the meeting, led the government delegation while ASUU President, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, attended alongside other leaders of the union.

Addressing reporters at the end of the discussion, Ngige said the meeting has been adjourned till Monday next week when the government hopes to get back to the lecturers on some of the issues raised.

He stated that agreement was reached on the issues around payment platforms, adding that the government was inclined to the University Transparency and Accountability System (UTAS) payment system developed by the university lecturers.

The nation’s education sector was hit with another setback last Monday when Professor Osodeke announced that the union had embarked on a warning strike.

As a result of the industrial action expected to last one month, academic activities have been grounded in various government-owned universities in the country.

ASUU declared the strike to re-echo its demands of revitalisation of public universities, payment of earned allowances, improved funding of state universities, and promotion arrears for members.

Another concern raised was the replacement of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) with the UTAS in the payment of emoluments to members, among others.

A week after the strike commenced, Ngige, while addressing Tuesday’s meeting, said the government was surprised that the lecturers could take such a decision.

According to him, commencing an industrial action was unnecessary at a time when the government is doing its best to resolve the issues raised by the lecturers.","The reconciliatory meeting between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities has ended inconclusively.

Ukraine Mobilises Reserves As Moscow Doubles Down On Demands,"Ukraine mobilised its military reserve Wednesday and urged its citizens to leave Russian territory as Moscow sharpened its demands, increasing fears of all-out war.

Kremlin chief President Vladimir Putin has defied an avalanche of international sanctions to put his forces on stand-by to occupy two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine.

In response, Kyiv’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has put Ukraine’s more than 200,000 reservists on notice that they will receive summons to return to their units.

Ukraine’s security council also on Wednesday called for a state of emergency in the country — a measure that still needs to be formally approved by parliament.

Meanwhile, Ukraine urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave, as the crisis deepened despite intense international pressure on Moscow, backed by new economic sanctions.

Western capitals say Russia has amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine’s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimean and on warships in the Black Sea.

Ukraine has around 200,000 military personnel and Wednesday’s call up could see up to 250,000 reservists aged between 18 and 60 receive their mobilisation papers.

Moscow’s total forces are much larger — around a million active duty personnel — and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.

– High cost of war –

But Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.

Shelling has intensified between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists, and civilians living near the front are fearful.

Dmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.

“She said: ‘Have you heard the news?’. How could I have known? There’s no electricity never mind internet. I don’t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I’m afraid,” he said.

Washington and Britain say Russia’s force is poised to strike Ukraine and trigger the most serious war in Europe for decades, but Putin says he is open to negotiation — within limits.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and is seeking to roll back the advance of Western influence in eastern Europe since the Cold War.

“The interests of Russia, the security of our citizens, are non-negotiable for us,” Putin declared, in a video address to mark the Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday.

On Tuesday, the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house, gave him unanimous approval to deploy troops to two breakaway Ukrainian regions now recognised by Moscow as independent, Donetsk and Lugansk.

Russia said it had established diplomatic relations “at the level of embassies” with the separatist statelets, which broke away from Kyiv in 2014 in a conflict that cost more than 14,000 lives.

Moscow also said it would evacuate diplomatic personnel from Ukraine to “protect their lives.”

Speaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.

US President Joe Biden later announced tough new sanctions against Russia for “beginning” an invasion of Ukraine, but said there was still time to avoid war.

Japan and Australia followed suit early Wednesday with their own stringent penalties for Moscow and individuals connected with the aggression against Ukraine.

Biden announced what he called the “first tranche” of sanctions, including steps to starve Russia of financing and target financial institutions and the country’s “elites”.

But he left the door open to a final effort at diplomacy to avert a full-scale Russian invasion.

“There’s no question that Russia is the aggressor, so we’re clear-eyed about the challenges we’re facing,” the US leader said.

Biden’s address followed a wave of sanctions announced by Britain and the European Union, after Putin recognised the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk separatist regions this week.

Germany also announced it was halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.

– ‘Full-scale invasion’ –

Kremlin officials have responded scornfully to the sanctions, and observers point out that energy-rich Russia has huge reserves of $639 billion and an $182-billion sovereign wealth fund to see it through a crisis.

Putin’s plans remain unclear, but Western officials have been warning for weeks he has been preparing an all-out invasion of Ukraine, a move that could spark a catastrophic war in Europe.

The White House signalled it no longer believes Russia is serious about avoiding conflict, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov scheduled for Thursday.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Putin said that Moscow had recognised the independence of Ukraine’s separatist regions within their administrative borders, including territory still controlled by Kyiv — raising the spectre of a clash.

He added that Western-brokered peace agreements on Ukraine’s conflict no longer existed and stressed that the deployment of Russian troops would “depend on the specific situation… on the ground.”

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had “every indication” that Moscow “continues to plan for a full-scale attack on Ukraine.”

British foreign minister Liz Truss told Sky News it was “likely” that Putin would “follow through on his plan for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine”.","Ukraine mobilised its military reserve Wednesday and urged its citizens to leave Russian territory as Moscow sharpened its demands, increasing fears of all-out war.

ECOWAS Rejects Mali’s Five-year Transition Proposal,"Nigeria’s former President and Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Council of the Wise (CoW), Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has said the sub-region would not accept the five-year transition period proposed by the military government in Mali because it is too long.

Jonathan, who is also ECOWAS Chief Mediator on the Mali crisis, said military regimes had become an aberration in the sub-region and could no longer be tolerated.

He spoke on Tuesday in Lagos during a press conference at the end of a two-day strategic retreat of the ECOWAS Council of the Wise.

Jonathan stressed that the proposal for a five-year transition period for the military regime by the Malian parliament was unacceptable because the time was not only too long, but also untenable.

The president stated, “If the parliament approves that, I don’t believe ECOWAS will accept it. I cannot say authoritatively because I am not the chair of the Authority of ECOWAS, but because I am the mediator, we feel that five years is too long for a transitional government. In 2012, when we had a similar experience in Mali, it was one and a half years within which elections were done, when the former speaker of parliament became the interim president.

“And within one and a half years elections were done. Niger, of course, that was 2011, when I was still head of state, when the military intervention happened, it was within 12 months, elections were conducted. We had a similar case in Burkina Faso within that period; within 12 months elections were conducted.

“We believe that ECOWAS does not want any coup d’état in the sub-region anyway. But assuming it happens, we believe that the period they will hold office should not be so long.

“In this February, they have spent about one and a half years already. Adding another five years is six and a half years. ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State will discuss it, but I believe ECOWAS may not accept it.

“We are going to negotiate it further with them and see that they reduce it because five years plus one and a half years, that is six and a half years, it is almost two tenures of an elected government. And I think for a transitional government it does not really add up.”

Jonathan said as part of a strategy to quicken the development of the region, ECOWAS was considering re-capitalisation of its regional bank.

He stated, “We also looked at some other things, like we have recommended that the ECOWAS Bank of Investment and Development should be capitalised properly and restructured so that it will play a key role in terms of assisting people in the private sector to build small and medium scale industries across the sub-region.

“That will increase the opportunity of young people getting loans to develop businesses and also create jobs for others. So we looked at other things, but basically none of these will bring immediate answer to a situation in a place like Mali. Already, the military are there and they want to stay for another five years. So that should be through negotiation, which the council of the wise will work with the commission, we will work with the Authority of Heads of State and Government to get that done.”

He added, “So when you now raise the issue of Mali parliament that have approved the five-year term transition, the parliament of Mali is a part of the government of Mali that is in operation. They are not elected members of the parliament and that is why ECOWAS parliament won’t even accept them to meet with the ECOWAS parliament. Because for you to be a member of the ECOWAS parliament you must be elected by your people.”

He said even though the CoW was constituted by the ECOWAS Commission as an important preventive, diplomatic, and mediation organ of the ECOWAS Peace and Security Architecture, it was not set up to immediately intervene in the security challenges facing the region.

Jonathan said, “I want the people to know that the purpose of the council of the wise is not to immediately intervene in the security challenges we have. We have three countries being run by the military, which is an aberration in the sub-region.

“But the main reason for the council of the wise is to come up with different ways that we should be doing things to reduce such infraction in our democratic setting. So that is the first.

“We will also make suggestions, but the council of the wise is mainly persuasive. It is like an organ of ECOWAS that will come up with advisory programmes and policies that will help the commission and, indeed, the Authority of Heads of State and Government to handle some of these issues.”

Jonathan said his council recommended for the region free and compulsory education for all children from primary to secondary school level as part of efforts to ensure that young people were no longer easily recruited into evil agenda.

Jonathan said the issue of bad leaders whose actions and inactions lead to crisis in their countries was also being looked into.","He spoke on Tuesday in Lagos during a press conference at the end of a two-day strategic retreat of the ECOWAS Council of the Wise.

"Nigeria: Citing Emergence of Previous Chairmen, Buhari Okays Consensus for APC Convention","Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, met with governors elected on the platform of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and okayed suggestions for a consensus option at the newly proposed March 26 national convention of the party.

Buhari met with the APC governors at the State House, Abuja, for about 15 minutes and discussed the current state of the party and the misgivings about its national convention. He noted that all former chairmen of APC, from Chief Bisi Akande, John Odigie-Oyegun, to Adams Oshiomhole, emerged through consensus.

But Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, dismissed insinuations that the 22 governors of APC and the Anambra State Deputy Governor were sharply divided over the date of the national convention, saying they merely disagreed. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen after the APC governors’ meeting with Buhari, however, noted that the governors had disagreed over the timing of the national convention, as some were of the belief that there were many unresolved issues. But he contended that they were all now on the same page.

El-Rufai said APC had adopted a formula, which was embraced by the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during its convention. Under the plan, APC would allow its northern and southern members swap positions from the ones held by the previous National Working Committee (NWC).

Judging by the copy of the zoning formula obtained by THISDAY last night, APC had resolved to have its national chairman come from the North-central, while conceding the office of National Secretary to the South-west.

Despite its recent challenges, Chairman of Northern States Governors’ Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, allayed concerns that the ruling party might collapse after Buhari’s tenure. Lalong believed APC would be stronger after the incumbent president.

El-Rufai, who was fielding questions from State House correspondents, said the governors had disagreed over the timing of the convention, because, “There were some governors that felt we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress issues in some states.

“As you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.

“Yes, there were differences in opinions about timing. Some of us are saying the constitution allows us to have convention even if three or four states have issues that are unresolved, while others are saying no, let us finish all the reconciliations and we do this convention. After all, there is no time limit for the convention as long as we do it before the time for the primaries.

“So, that was the difference. This is what the media has called divided governors. In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra State agreeing on any issue.

“We can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we are all on the same page.”

The Kaduna State governor also disclosed that APC had agreed on a zoning formula that would swap offices previously held between North and South.

By the arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last NWC will go to the South, and vice versa, in the coming dispensation.

El-Rufai affirmed that agreement had been reached on zoning.

He stated, “We have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south has had in the last NWC, and vice versa.

“It is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.”

Speaking also after their meeting with Buhari, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, revealed that Buhari was in favour of consensus in selecting candidates for party offices.

Bagudu said, “On consensus, Mr. President reminded us that we have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus: Baba Akande emerged as the pioneer chairman of the party by consensus; His Excellency, John Oyegun emerged by consensus; His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole emerged by consensus.

“So, he is a believer in consensus as one of the options for producing leadership, and he urged us to explore consensus, so that we can generate a list. While recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent, but knowing that just one person will occupy the office, consensus is part of our constitution, and he urged us to work towards consensus.

“And the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level; it’s almost certain that we will achieve it.

“Then, the date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday on their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have heard the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position.”

Bagudu explained that even though the planned zonal congresses of APC were not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.

According to him, “On proposed zonal congresses not in the constitution, I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday (Monday), there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn.

“So, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the constitution, particularly, how you do zonal congresses. And we have in the past done them with national convention, but nothing again in the constitution stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided.”

Asked if the APC governors were divided, Bagudu retorted, “Are governors divided? Not at all! The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President; we are appreciative of his leadership. We commend him for his leadership.

“We are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.”

On his part, Lalong maintained that the ruling party would not collapse after Buhari’s exit, saying, “I think that from the progress report read by our chairman, and from several assumptions, and also several reports that we are seeing what tremendous efforts the federal government is doing. We are already going around commissioning projects here and there in all the various states.

“There is no doubt, although, you are not specific as to which reason will make us not to come back again, but as far as we are concerned, based on assessment, and based on what the federal government is doing, there is every hope that this party, this government will move beyond our president and that is what he has been saying, that by the grace of God, this government will move beyond his tenure.”

Nineteen of the 22 APC governors were in attendance at the meeting held at the Council Chambers, which also had in attendance Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.

The governors in attendance were those of Yobe, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Cross River, Kaduna, Lagos, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Kano, Imo, Kogi, Ogun, Plateau and Anambra’s deputy governor.

Zoning Formula

According to the zoning formula obtained yesterday by THISDAY, APC has zoned its chairmanship position to North-central, which implies that the presidential ticket of the party might go to the south, in addition to the office of the National Secretary, which has been given to the South-west in specific.

Other positions zoned to the North-central are National Vice Chairman (NC), Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.

APC zoned the following positions to the South-south: National Vice Chairman (SS), National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader

The offices zoned to the South-west are National Secretary, National Vice Chairman (South-West), National Youth Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.

For the North-west, the positions given are National Vice Chairman (NW), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability – PWD) Leader, among others.

The party zoned the position of the Deputy National Chairman (S) to the South-east, with other offices like National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.

North-east would produce Deputy National Chairman (N), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (NW), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, among others.

Interestingly, the zoning plan has tactically knocked out a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and Sunny Monidafe.

The chairmanship aspirants favoured by the method are the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Musa; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; and former governors of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura and Abdudulahi Adamu.

Buni Threatens to Resign

But while APC may have succeeded in dousing the raging issues over its national convention, a new problem seems to be developing.

An insider told THISDAY last night that the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had threatened to resign his position, citing accusations of inefficiency from many APC governors accused.

The source said regarding Buni, “While some of the governors were ready to grab his resignation, others cautioned that accepting his resignation would draw the party back. And on the basis of that, the governors encouraged him to continue until the national convention is held.”

However, while the governors and the president agreed to swap offices between North and South, THISDAY gathered that the leaders of the party specifically agreed that the national chairman should go to the North-central.

According to the source, while the party’s leaders agreed on consensus option in electing the national officers, the governors agreed that the president should be given the privilege to pick the national chairman.

Thus, ahead of the national convention on March 26, the meeting yesterday also agreed to hold national caucus meeting to resolve all pending issues.

"Nigeria, Iraq Kick Against Hike in OPEC Oil Output as Prices Surge Towards $100","Nigeria and Iraq have said the strategy employed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to gradually raise oil production is enough to balance the market.

Both countries insisted that there was no need for OPEC to be more aggressive, despite crude oil surge this year to almost $100 a barrel.

The 23-nation alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, would meet on March 2 to decide the next line of action in terms of the amount of oil it expected members to pump in April.

Bloomberg quoted Nigeria’s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, as maintaining that the international cartel would not need to take any unplanned barrels to the market, stressing that the current plan perfectly serves the market as it is.

Sylva told reporters at an event in Doha, Qatar, according to Bloomberg, “We won’t do anything extraordinary at this time because we are expecting a lot of production from outside of OPEC+.”

He added, “There’s no need at all to bring on more barrels than the current plan. We are expecting more production if a nuclear deal with Iran works out (since) there will be production from them.”

Several of OPEC+’s biggest producers want to continue to add 400,000 barrels a day of crude to the market each month, Bloomberg reported.

In addition, Iraq’s Ihsan Jabbar said OPEC and its partners would make their decision for April at the March meeting, after reviewing fresh data on supply and demand.

The comments came even as Brent crude rose 2.3 per cent to $97.60 a barrel, extending this year’s jump to 26 per cent.

Tuesday’s gain occurred after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he was recognising two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Ukraine.

Iraq’s energy minister, Jabbar, said OPEC was factoring in growth in output from non-OPEC+ members, such as Brazil and Canada, and did not want to see any increase in commercially-stored oil around the world.

“The market will have more and more oil so we think there’s no need” to deviate from today’s strategy, Jabbar said in an interview in Qatar, where he was attending a natural gas conference, together with Sylva and others.

“We will not create any growth to the commercial storage. We will secure all the demand by making the required supply,” he added.

Russia, a major oil and gas producer, plans to send “peacekeeping forces” to the Ukrainian region in a dramatic escalation of the on-going conflict. Moscow has consistently denied having plans to invade Ukraine.

Some major oil importers have called on OPEC+ to pump faster and put pressure on the likes of Saudi Arabia to use up some of their spare capacity.

Jabbar said it would be “unfair” for any OPEC+ state to raise output beyond its quota, despite many members struggling to reach theirs.

Nigeria has been struggling to meet its OPEC allocation for months and has as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.

Despite the over 1.7 million barrels’ output allowed by the organisation, the country has managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, going by the latest OPEC review.

Although there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country’s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation’s oil and gas industry.

Last week, the International Agency Energy Agency (IEA), which advises rich countries, said OPEC+ was pumping almost one million barrels a day below its target.

“We have come from the recovery from COVID,” the Iraqi minister said.

“It is not fair that you will give the increase just for some countries,” he added.

Iraq undershot its output target last month because of bad weather at ports, Jabbar said. The country should meet its quota for February of around 4.3 million barrels a day, he noted.

Meanwhile, the Chief Executive of Vitol, one of the world’s biggest oil traders, expects oil prices to climb to $100 and remain at that level for an extended period of time.

This bullish prediction, he said, was driven by a belief that global demand would surge in the second half of the year and could surpass 100 million barrels per day.

On the supply side, he said it was the fear of shrinking spare production capacity and restraint from US shale that was driving oil prices higher. Oil prices will go higher, and they would stay there for an extended period of time, said the chief executive of Vitol, Russell Hardy.

“The 100 million-barrel number is probably going to be exceeded this year,” Hardy told Bloomberg, adding, “Demand is going to surge in the second half.”

According to him, demand for crude this year could surpass 100 million barrels daily.

Like many others, Vitol’s chief executive noted that the imbalance in global oil markets was fuelling inflation and threatening to interfere with the recovery of the global economy from the fallout of the pandemic.

However, more oil does not seem to be coming, as the US and European super majors are focusing on shareholder returns instead of production growth, and national oil companies in the OPEC+ countries are sticking to their original plan of adding 400,000 bpd to total production every month.

“Eventually we’re going to run out of spare capacity. That’s what the market is trying to work out,” Hardy noted.

Major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, had already recently predicted that prices would hit $100 a barrel.

‘Rest in Power’: Arbery’s Killers Guilty on All Federal Hate-Crime Charges,"The three white men convicted of chasing down and murdering a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, as he was out jogging in their suburban Georgia community, were found guilty on Tuesday of committing federal hate crimes and other offenses in the 2020 killing.

A predominantly white jury deliberated for about four hours over two days before returning the verdict against Travis McMichael, 36, his father, former police officer Gregory McMichael, 66, and a neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan, 52, in U.S. District Court in Brunswick, Georgia.

“Ahmaud will continue to rest in peace but he will now begin to rest in power,” Wanda Cooper-Jones, Ahmaud’s mother, said outside the courthouse after the verdict was read.

All three men were found guilty of violating Arbery’s civil rights by attacking him because of his race, and of attempted kidnapping, capping the latest high-profile trial to probe issues of vigilantism and racial violence in America.

The McMichaels were also convicted of a federal firearms charge. Bryan was not charged with a weapons offense. The hate-crimes felony, the most serious of the charges the defendants faced, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. The judge has not yet set a sentencing date.

The three men were convicted last year of murder and other crimes in state court and sentenced to life terms for the shotgun slaying of Arbery, 25, a onetime high school football star who worked for a truck-washing company and his father’s landscaping business.

Prosecutors in the state trial avoided characterizing the killing as racist, seeking only to prove that the McMichaels and Bryan were responsible for his death.

Cooper-Jones on Tuesday railed against the Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors, who had originally reached a plea deal with the defendants to avoid a trial, as typically happens in hate-crimes cases, such as with Derek Chauvin, the police officer who kneeled on George Floyd’s neck and was found guilty of murdering him.

In a rare move, the judge last month rejected the plea deal after Ahmaud’s family implored her not to accept it.

“What we got today, we wouldn’t have gotten today if it wasn’t for the fight that the family put up,” Cooper-Jones said. “What the DOJ did today, they was made to do today. It wasn’t because it’s what they wanted to do.”

The family and supporters plan to hold a vigil on Wednesday in the neighborhood where Arbery was killed to mark the second anniversary of his murder.","The three white men convicted of chasing down and murdering a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, as he was out jogging in their suburban Georgia community, were found guilty on Tuesday of committing federal hate crimes and other offenses in the 2020 killing.

West Unveils Sanctions with More Ready If Russia Launches Full-Scale Ukraine Invasion,"Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and threatened to go further if Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its neighbour.

The United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan announced plans to target banks and elites while Germany halted a major gas pipeline project from Russia in one of the worst security crises in Europe in decades.

Bitter about Ukraine’s long-term goal to join NATO and claiming it as historic Russian land, Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, according to U.S. estimates, and ordered soldiers into the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions to “keep the peace”.

The United States dismisses that justification as “nonsense”.

“To put it simply Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,” U.S. Presidnt Joe Biden said on Tuesday.

“This is the beginning of a Russian invasion.”

Satellite imagery over the past 24 hours shows several new troop and equipment deployments in western Russia and more than 100 vehicles at a small airfield in southern Belarus, which borders Ukraine, according to U.S. firm Maxar.

The Ukrainian military said early on Wednesday one soldier had been killed and six wounded in 96 incidents of shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east over the previous 24 hours. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian cancelled separate scheduled meetings with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday as weeks of frantic diplomacy failed to end the crisis.

Plans announced by Biden to bolster Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania include sending 800 infantry soldiers and up to eight F-35 fighter jets to locations along NATO’s eastern flank, a U.S. official said, but are a redistribution, not additions.

Putin did not watch Biden’s speech and Russia will first look at what the United States has outlined before responding, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, cited by Russian news agencies.

Putin said he was always open to finding diplomatic solutions but that “the interests of Russia and the security of our citizens are unconditional for us.”

Moscow is calling for security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, while the United States and its allies offer Putin confidence-building and arms control steps to defuse the stand-off.

Lavrov brushed off the threat of sanctions.

“Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia,” he said.

GAS PIPELINE HALTED

In perhaps the most significant measure announced on Tuesday, Germany halted the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom , a move likely to raise gas prices in Europe.

Built and awaiting German approval, the pipeline had been set to ease the pressure on European consumers facing record energy prices but critics including the United States have long argued it would increase Europe’s energy dependence on Russia.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that gas prices in Europe were likely to rise in the short term. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council, suggested prices could double.

“Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros per thousand cubic metres!” he said on Twitter.

The Kremlin said it hoped the Nord Stream delay was temporary and Putin said Russia “aims to continue uninterrupted supplies” of energy to the world.

U.S. sanctions target Russian elites and two state-owned banks, excluding them from the U.S. banking system, banning them from trading with Americans, and freezing their U.S. assets. They also seek to deny the Russian government access to Western financing.

The U.S. sanctions applied to VEB bank and Russia’s military bank, Promsvyazbank, which does defence deals. Russia’s two largest commercial lenders, Sberbank and VTB, would face American sanctions if Moscow proceeded with its invasion of Ukraine, a U.S. official said.

Biden said that while more sanctions were being prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, it was critical to ensure such measures did not hurt Americans in the form of steeper energy costs.

Crude oil futures on Tuesday reached their highest levels since 2014. A U.S. State Department official said sanctions that could be imposed in the near future “will not target oil and gas flows”.

Britain announced sanctions on three billionaires with close links to Putin, and five smaller lenders including Promsvyazbank.

The European Union has agreed to blacklist banks involved in financing separatists in eastern Ukraine and to cut the Russian government out of its debt markets. read more","The United States dismisses that justification as “nonsense”.

Youths warn sacked CoS against blackmailing Emmanuel,"Youth leaders from Akwa Ibom South (Eket) Senatorial District have warned the sacked Chief of Staff (CoS) to Governor Udom Emmanuel, Mr. Ephraim Inyang-eyen, to desist from blackmailing the governor.

They accused Inyang-eyen of maligning Emmanuel because of the governor’s insistence that the Senate seat of Akwa Ibom South (Eket) must go to Ikot Abasi Federal Constituency.

The youth said the Senate seat in the zone had always been on the basis of rotation among the three federal constituencies that made up the area, namely Ikot Abasi, Eket and Oron.

Inyang-eyen, a former commissioner for Works from Eket Federal Constituency, had indicated his interest to vie for the Senate seat despite it being zoned to Ikot Abasi Federal Constituency.

The Chairman, Youth Leaders of Akwa Ibom South Senatorial District, Mr. Theodore Williams, addressed a news conference yesterday on behalf of the youth.

Court annuls APC congresses in Anambra,"Anambra State High Court sitting in Awka yesterday nullified wards, local governments and state congresses held by the All Progressives Congress (APC).

The party last month conducted congresses, which produced Mr. Basil Ejidike as the chairman.

But delivering judgment in a matter before him, Justice Ike Ogu of High Court four Awka ruled that the exercise contravened initial interlocutory injunction earlier issued by his court.

Ogu, whose judgment on the suit filed by Lawrence Emegini and others, ruled that the plaintiff’s case succeeded.

The court said the tenure of wards, local governments and states executives elected during 2018 congresses in Anambra subsisted.

Ogu noted that whatever congress conducted by APC and its representatives in the state while the tenure of the 2018 elected executives subsisted, contravened the order of the court.

He said Emeka Ibe-led executives should be allowed to complete their tenure, which was illegally terminated.

Reacting, the Secretary of APC in a faction loyal to Ibe, Mr. Chukwuma Agufugo, described the judgment as victory for the rule of law.

He decried efforts by some members to disorganise the party and hijack its leadership, thanking God that the court had liberated the party.

Counsel for the plaintiff, Chief P. I. Ikwueto (SAN), said the court decision had vindicated his clients.

The legal adviser of one of the party factions dissolved by the judgment, Chinoso Chinwuba, said their next move would be determined after studying the judgment.","Anambra State High Court sitting in Awka yesterday nullified wards, local governments and state congresses held by the All Progressives Congress (APC).

Russian invasion: Nigeria urges citizens in Ukraine to protect themselves,"The Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine has urged citizens in the country to remain calm and be responsible for their own personal security.

It advised those who want to relocate to a safe place to ensure that they validate all their resident documents for ease of return to Ukraine when they desire.

This was contained in a statement on Thursday following the declaration of State of Emergency and Martial Law by the Ukrainian government over the invasion by Russia.

The statement read, “The attention of the Embassy has been drawn to a declaration of State of Emergency, and Martial Law on the entire territory of Ukraine, except the Donestk and Luhansk regions by the government of Ukraine, effective from mid-night of February 23, 2022, for a period of 30 days as well as the latest development on the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

“With this, regional (OBLAST) Commissions are to decide on the necessary security measures to adopt in strengthening the protection of public order and facilities for the safety of the citizenry and the running of the economy in their domain. It can be restriction of movement, an additional inspection and verification of certain documents of individuals among others. These are preventing measures aimed at ensuring that the country remains calm and the economy continues to function uninterrupted while it lasted.

“In view of the development, the Embassy urges Nigerian nationals resident in Ukraine to remain calm but be very vigilant and responsible for their personal security and safety.

“The Embassy wishes to add that should any Nigerian national consider the situation as emotionally disturbing, such national may wish to relocate to anywhere considered safe by private arrangements. They should, however, ensure that they do all the needful to validate all their resident documents for ease of return to the country when desired.

“In addition, in case of students seeking such temporary relocation, they are enjoined to seek proper clearance and guarantee from their respective institutions, authorities/agents on the way forward in respect to their studies during the period and/or thereafter.

“For those who still consider it appropriate to remain in the country, be assured that the Embassy remains open for its consular duties and responsibilities at all times. It will always avail you updates when necessary.”

"Insecurity: El-Rufai calls for land, air assault across affected states","The Governor of Kaduna, Nasir El-Rufai, has called for simultaneous air and land attack on the terrorists by contiguous states.

This is as he said the piecemeal attacks have not been effective enough to curb the spate of kidnapping in the Northwest.

El-Rufai said this on Thursday morning during the weekly ministerial briefing organised by the Presidential media team.

He revealed that when attacked and chased out of Kaduna, the terrorists seamlessly move to neighbouring states because of the vast forest range.

El-Rufai said the bandits, now terrorists, are engaged in kidnapping because of the lucrative nature of the “business” of kidnapping.

He explained that although a simultaneous land and air assault in all affected states may lead to the loss of innocent lives, his administration is willing to risk the collateral damage that comes with securing Kaduna State and its environs.

The Governor said his administration had invested in the technology that enables him to know where the terrorists were in real-time.

With a budget of over N200 million every month, he said his state remains one of the most committed to security.

He said before the end of May 2022, Kaduna will be covered with CCTV cameras and facial recognition technology that would enable easy crime investigation.

The Safe City project, he said, is powered by the Chinese company, Huawei, and others.

Details shortly…

"Without Buhari, Nigeria would have been like Venezuela —Ngige","Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, Wednesday described leadership as very critical to the survival of any human society, saying without President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been like Venezuela.

Ngige said Nigeria was passing through hard times, not because of the current government, but as a result of poor planning over the years.

Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan, in a statement said the minister spoke in his office after his induction as a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Leadership, Entrepreneurship and Corporate Governance, INSLEC, a leading global professional body of both present and aspiring leaders, entrepreneurs and people in corporate governance.

This came as the President/Chairman of the council, Professor Gabriel Emecheta, said the decision to elect Ngige as a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the INSLEC speaks volumes about his pristine and differentiated worth as a leader, mentor and bridge builder.

According to Ngige “A good leader must be an implementation man. He should be knowledgeable, because after the vision, he will dissect and crystalise them. He should be a jack of all trade and master of all. He may not score distinction in all but should be able to score distinction in many.

“He must also be courageous to implement hard decisions. If you don’t implement courageously, some of the visions will die or will not be implemented for the good of all. He must also be compassionate, knowing when to tamper justice with mercy, to show the human part of him. He should exude milk of human kindness.

“I know that our country is passing through a very rough time now because we have not planned well. It is not this administration. We know we were all dependent on oil. So, when oil prices came crashing and when security issues arose, disrupting production, we were caught napping. Because of that we went into recession. Later on, COVID-19 forced us to go into a second recession. We are not yet out of the woods.

“We thank God. I am part of this government. I know that if we don’t have the kind of leader that we have who is strong like President Muhammadu Bihari, the experience of Nigeria would have been like that of Venezuela.

The citizens of Nigeria would have spilled into the Cameroons, Niger and other places as refugees. We were looking forward to it. But he forced us all to go into agriculture. We made agriculture the first signature programme of the administration and provided food security so that we can eat whatever we grow here.”

Ngige noted that Nigeria has stopped the importation of rice, sorghum, millet, tomatoes and other things hitherto imported, all of which were dependent on the scarce foreign exchange.

According to him, the country’s GDP grew by 5.01 percent in fourth quarter 2021, the highest in the last seven years, marking three consecutive quarters of growth, following the negative growths recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.

“Services provided the lead, followed by agriculture, even though it had a deep and then, followed by Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

“So, we have to be grateful to the Government and our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, for standing firm that we will import food anymore here. Even if he didn’t stand firm, we didn’t have the money anymore to start importing potatoes, tooth pick, chocolate and others.”

Ngige dedicated the fellowship to the ordinary Nigerians, saying that he believes in the have-nots and would continue to fight for them wherever he found himself.

He thanked the institute and chairman of the governing board for the fellowship and pledged to be a good member, not only in terms of participation, but also loyalty and obedience to the institute.

Earlier, Professor Ayandiji Aina, the Chairman, Planning and Resource Committee extolled Ngige’s creativity, confidence, decisiveness, humility and trustworthiness, describing him as a conflict manager of great distinction.

I know that if we don’t have the kind of leader that we have who is strong like President Muhammadu Bihari, the experience of Nigeria would have been like that of Venezuela.

NBET hails CBN’s critical role in power sector,"…Says apex bank’s interventions stabilizing NESI

…Mulls coordinated way to deal with DISCOs’ default

By Chris Ochay

The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company, NBET, Dr. Nnaemeka Eweluka, has said that the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, played critical role in stabilizing the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry, NESI.

Dr. Eweluka noted that the CBN through its critical interventions in the power sector has performed a very positive role in trying to sort out the electricity market challenges.

Recall NBET, the off taker agency recently organized a two-day capacity building workshop for journalists covering the sector under the Power Correspondents Association of Nigeria, PCAN, and Civil Society Organisations, held at Lagos Continental Hotels, Victoria Island, Lagos.

Eweluka explained further that the apex bank working in collaboration with the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, and the Electricity Distribution Companies, DISCOs, was able to identify critical projects if quickly addressed would restore normalcy and increase production and supply of electricity.

According to him, “So basically what happened was that the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has actually performed a very positive role in trying to sort out this electricity market challenges.

“So what happened was that CBN working with Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, and the Electricity Distribution Companies DISCOs, CBN basically asked what are those critical projects that if they are addressed today can quickly yield results in the sector.

“This is even as the Federal Government government is doing this Siemens project and TCN is implementating the report, what are those critical projects that if they are done today, will unlock additional megawatts quickly.

“And so the DISCOs and TCN worked together to come up with a list of some critical projects and I can’t be specific on the amount, maybe we can furnish that subsequently but that is what is happening.

“CBN decided to find those critical interventions so that there can be some quick wins even as the bigger project is being implemented, let’s have some quick wins that will have impacts on the lives of Nigerians.”

On the issue of recouping DISCOs’ debts, Eweluka, the renowned technocrat, said, “Now some of these are being handled.”

“These committees that I mentioned, I noticed that this is just not an NBET issue, there are enforcement mechanisms that will reside in about, for about five different agencies that I mentioned earlier, NBET is there, we have our vesting contract.

The Bureau of Public Enterprise, BPE, signed performance agreements with these different DISCOs where they are also committed to giving certain things or face consequences.

“NERC issues their licences again with the commitment for them to meet licence conditions as well as regulatory orders or face consequences.

“The Market Operator, MO, that administers the market rules, again the market rule makes it clear that every market participants must meet certain obligations or face consequences.

“Now what we are doing is to, because we have seen that there is risk in having these different agencies acting without coordination, we said no.

“There is a meeting that will happen shortly because what we said is that let us have a coordinated way of dealing with DISCOs’ default.

‘I think it was today or was it yesterday that somebody mentioned about the business continuity because there are different tools that resides within government for dealing with non-performance.

‘And so what we are looking at is coordination of consequence management and in consequence management so we are looking at having a coordination of consequence management within the sector amongst all the players that interface with DISCOs.”","Dr. Eweluka noted that the CBN through its critical interventions in the power sector has performed a very positive role in trying to sort out the electricity market challenges.

Breaking: Court gives NDLEA 48 hours to respond to Abba Kyari’s bail request,"By Ikechukwu Nnochiri

The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, ordered the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, to within 48 hours, respond to an application the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, Abba Kyari, who is currently in its custody, filed to be released on bail on health ground.

Justice Inyang Ekwo made the order on a day the NDLEA claimed that it was not served with Kyari’s application.

Counsel to the agency, Mr. Mike Kasa, told the court that he had yet to receive a copy of the bail request that was attached to Kyari’s suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/182/22.

Consequently, a short ruling, Justice Ekwo, directed both parties to go back and put their house in order, even as he adjourned the matter till Monday to hear the motion for bail.

DCP Kyari, who hitherto headed the Police Intelligence Response Team, IRT, had in the suit he filed against the Federal Government, challenged his continued detention in the custody of the NDLEA.

He is among other things, praying the court to order FG to pay him N500million and also tender written apology to him in two national dailies for the unlawful violation of his fundamental human rights.

He is further praying the court for, “a declaration that arrest and continued detention of the Applicant by the Agent of the Respondent without bringing him before a court of competent jurisdiction from 12th of February 2022 till date, is Illegal, unlawful and a gross violation of Applicant’s fundamental right to personal liberty and freedom of movement guaranteed by Section 35(1) of the I999 Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and Article 6 of the African Charter on human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act.

“A declaration that announcing the Applicant in the Press without giving him right to fair hearing nor establishing a prima-facie case against him is illegal, unlawful and an infringement on his fundamental right.

“A declaration that declaring the Applicant syndicate of the suspect without establishing a prima-facie case against the Applicant is unlawful and an infringement on his fundamental right”.

“A declaration that torture, degrading and in human treatment given to the Applicant by the Agent of the Respondent is illegal, unlawful and an infringement on the Applicant’s fundamental human right

“A declaration that refusal to grant administrative bail to Applicant on alleged bailable offence is unlawful and infringement on the Apphcant’s fundamental human right.

As well as, “an order of this Honourable Court restraining the Respondent’s agents, servants proxies, police or anyone acting on their behalf from further harassing, detaining, intimidating, arresting the Applicant unlawfully”.

Besides, he prayed the court to order his release on bail to enable him to take care of his deteriorating health condition.

Kyari, told the court that he is suffering from “diabetes; high blood pressure and severe heart disease that may cause death”.

“That the Applicant was receiving medical treatment on daily basis due to seriousness of the illness.

“That since 12th of February, 2022, the Applicant has not accessed any medical treatment, which is very dangerous to his health.

“That failure of the Applicant to check his heart, high blood pressure will result in severe health problems or may even lead to heart failure and death. Medical report from National Hospital is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit A.

“That due to the Applicant being a diabetic patient and on medical diet, he does not eat outside his home and this is causing a very big hardship on the Applicant that is in NDLEA custody.

“That the health of the Applicant cannot be managed while in NDLEA custody due to the seriousness of his illness. That it is in the interest of justice that this Applicant be admitted to bail on health ground.

“That the Applicant will not jump bail if bail is granted him. That he had a reliable surety who is in court”, read an affidavit he attached in support of the ex-parte application he filed for bail.

Meanwhile, instead of granting the application, Justice Ekwo, ordered Kyari’s lawyer, Cynthia Ikena, to put FG which was cited as the sole Respondent in the matter, on notice.

Justice Ekwo noted that the suit contained some averments that would require FG’s response.

“Upon studying the process of the Applicant and averments in support thereon, I am of the opinion that the Respondent should be put on notice”, the Judge held.","Justice Inyang Ekwo made the order on a day the NDLEA claimed that it was not served with Kyari’s application.

Wike mocks APC over postponed convention,"Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.

By Davies Iheamnachor, PORT HARCOURT

Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, has mocked the All Progressives Congress, APC, over its postponed national convention.

Wike said a party that cannot organise its convention should be viewed as lacking the ability to rule the country.

The governor spoke at the special grand reception organised to celebrate the National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, by Imo State PDP Chapter at Kanu Nwankwo Sports Complex, Owerri, yesterday, according to a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri.

Wike said such inability as shown by the APC was another proof for Nigerians to rely in denying the APC any place of governance both at the federal level and in any state of the federation in 2023.

He said: “Nigerians are angry because the party (APC) at the national level is a failure. It’s a failure to the point that it is ruling Nigeria with tension. Ordinarily to sign the Electoral Act, they keep on postponing it everyday and Nigerians are tired.

“A party that cannot hold a national convention is it a party that can rule Nigeria? Ordinary convention, a party in power cannot hold one. Look at how we did our own. That is to tell you that PDP is the party that should rule Nigeria. This is the party that will rule Imo State too.”

Wike enjoined members of the PDP in Imo State not to succumb to any form of intimidation against them by any party, adding that days of such intimidation are gone.He emphasised that one of the reasons for attending the reception was to tell them of the need for PDP to strategise and reclaim the governorship of Imo State because the sitting governor has failed already.

Wike said: “The only mistake that we will make to allow the man to come back is for us not to work together, and we will not make that mistake. “Now, all of us must unite. If there is no party, there will be no governor. If there is no party, there will be no president.

“Let nobody fear, nobody can intimidate us. Can you be intimidated? All that time has passed when somebody that carried fourth will come first. It will never happen again.

“But if you want us to take back Imo State in the next election, all of us must work together. We are ready to support you to take back Imo State.”

Meanwhile, Chairman, Board of Trustees, BOT, of the party, Senator Walid Jubril, acknowledged the huge work done by the leaders of the party to ensure it waxes stronger.

Lawan was convicted by a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on June 22, 2021, on a three-count charge of soliciting bribes, agreeing to accept bribes and actually accepting a $500,000 bribe from a businessman, Femi Otedola.

The High Court of the FCT, in a judgment by Justice Angela Otaluka, sentenced Lawan to seven years on count one; seven years on count two, and five years on count three.

The court held that the prosecution failed to prove both counts relating to demanding for and agreeing to accept a $3 million bribe from Otedola.

The appellate court found that the prosecution was only able to prove the third count relating to his accepting bribe of $500,000.

The court then acquitted Lawan on counts one and two (on which he was sentenced to seven years per count), but convicted him on count three (on which he was sentenced to five years).

"Banditry, kidnapping in Kaduna would’ve been history if not for ICC – El-Rufai","Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, has said the menace of bandits and kidnappers would have been resolved once and for all by the military if it was not for the fear of being dragged before the International Court of Justice, ICC.

The Governor made the remark while speaking at the weekly ministerial press briefing organized by the Presidential Communications Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday.

According to him, while he had campaigned for the bandits to be classified as terrorists, there were some pushbacks on the ground that they do not have a recognized leadership structure.

El-Rufai said he was delighted over the court ruling, which recently declared the bandits as terrorists and therefore made them “a fair game.”

According to him, dealing with the criminality permanently would require simultaneous ground and air attacks in all the states hosting the criminals to prevent them from escaping.

He said the locations of the terrorists has never been a mystery, insisting that they must be wiped out at once rather than the present piecemeal approach if the problem must be solved.

He also said the Fulanis who are involved in the criminality will never abandon the business on their own because they make far more money from it than they would have made from the legitimate cattle business.

El-Rufai affirmed that kidnapping and terrorism had since become business but with the added element of collaborating with Boko Haram even as he said the effort to tackle the menace had been uncoordinated.

He said some state governors that thought negotiating with the criminals would end the problem later realized that it was a mistake.

He revealed that northwest state governments began a process of cooperation and co-financing the military operation against cattle rustling.

He regretted that the operation was not sustained as some of them backed out after some success was recorded only for kidnapping to take centre stage.

According to the el-Rufai, in the reported cases, while 937 were killed and 1,972 kidnapped by bandits in the state in 2020, a total of 1,192 were killed and 3,348 kidnapped in 2021, suggesting a deterioration in the situation.

He advocated the recruitment of more hands and procurement of sufficient equipment, adding that the lack of capacity of Nigeria’s security agencies in terms of adequate personnel and equipment was also creating a hindrance to ending insecurity.","Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, has said the menace of bandits and kidnappers would have been resolved once and for all by the military if it was not for the fear of being dragged before the International Court of Justice, ICC.

Russia had attacked Ukraine’s multiple borders, the state border service reports.

The border said the attacks are targeting border units, border patrols and checkpoints using artillery, heavy equipment and small arms.

The service added that Ukraine’s border guards, along with Ukraine’s Armed Forces and National Guard, are firing back and its air force shut down five Russian planes and several attack helicopters.","Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, has blamed the United States President, Joe Biden for Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

High ticket rates: ‘There’s fire on the mountain’ – Nigerian airlines,"The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has explained the increment in ticket rates, now N50,000 minimum for economy class.

The Air Peace Chairman told reporters that Jet A1 fuel which previously sold for N200 per litre now costs N430.

Onyema rejected the labelling of AON as a “cartel”, adding that they never agreed to fix a specific rate.

He recalled that airlines charged more than N50,000 occasionally including the Christmas period.

Onyema said Ground Handling Companies raised their charges by 300 per cent after the National Assembly’s approval.

“So if the cost of my operation has gone up by 300 percent, just from the ground handling services alone, what do I do?” he queried.

“If the cost of aviation fuel has risen by over 200 percent, what should I do? If the cost of forex has risen from N340 to N585, what should I do?”

The AON reminded Nigerians that the airline business is “dollarized”.

“In year 2000, the lowest fare was N2,200, equivalent to $100 then. Now 22 years down the line, Nigerian airlines, we were charging less than $30, $40.

Russia vs Ukraine: Attempts to interfere will lead to consequences – Putin warns countries,"Russian President, Vladimir Putin has warned other countries against interfering in its military action in Ukraine.

Putin on Thursday in a televised address announced a military operation in Ukraine, claiming it’s intended to protect civilians.

He noted that Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine but its military operation aims to ensure a “demilitarization” of Ukraine.

Putin urged the Ukrainian military to put down their arms, adding that they will be responsible for any bloodshed.

He warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action in Ukraine would lead to “consequences they have never seen”.

He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees.

Putin said the attack was necessary to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine swarmed that its allies will respond to the unprovoked attack by Putin.

Aregbesola’s man asks court to void Oyetola’s victory,"The battle for the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has shifted to the court.

Moshood Adeoti, who lost to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola in the primary election at the weekend, has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to declare him winner of the shadow poll.

In the direct primary conducted by a committee, chaired by Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRasak, the governor polled 222,169 votes to beat Adeoti, who scored 12, 921 votes and former House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Yusuff Lasun, who got 460 votes.

Adeoti was supported by Minister of Interior and former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola.

Supporters of the plaintiff had previously challenged the outcome of the ward and local government congresses in court at Osogbo and Ikire. The cases were dismissed.

Many stakeholders have lauded Governor AbdulRasak for conducting a free, fair and transparent exercise.

Before the commencement of the poll, he allowed the aspirants to crosscheck the party membership register to allay any fear of exclusion of their supporters from the register and from voting.

The voting, sorting, counting and poll announcement was also transparent.

Civil society groups who monitored the exercise urged other parties and states to learn from the Osun experience.

But Adeoti prayed the court for a declaration that he was the validly nominated candidate.

Adeoti further prayed the court to declare that Oyetola was not qualified to contest under the party’s constitution, because he is an officer of the party.

He also sought, among others, an order directing the APC to forward his name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the validly nominated candidate, rather than Oyetola.

Adeoti, the plaintiff, made the prayers in his originating summons in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/203 filed through his counsel, Chiesonu Okpoko, SAN.

The APC, Oyetola and INEC, who are the 1st to 3rd defendants respectively, are yet to file a reply.

Oyetola swept all the 30 Local Government Areas (LGA) and Ife-East Area Office in the primary.

In his suit, Adeoti raised seven questions for determination, to challenge Oyetola’s victory.

He contended, among others, that Oyetola was by virtue of his appointment by the APC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) as a member of the party’s Caretaker Extraordinary and Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), was an officer of the party.

According to him, Oyetola ought to have resigned his membership of the CECPC and leave office as an officer of the party at least 30 days prior to the date of the primary to qualify for participation in the primary.

He argued that this “refusal and/or neglect to resign his membership of the CECPC, disqualified him as a candidate in the primary.

The plaintiff prayed the court for 12 reliefs, including “A declaration that by virtue of Article 2 of the 1st Defendant’s Constitution (October 2014 as Amended), the decisions of the CECPC or any of its organs or any committee set up by it, cannot override the provisions of the 1st Defendant’s Constitution.

“A declaration that by the combined effect of section 222 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as Amended) and Article 31 (1li) of the 1st Defendant’s (October 2014 as Amended), the 2nd Defendant ought to have resigned his membership of the CECPC and leave office as an officer of the 1st Defendant at least 30 days prior to the date of the 1st Defendant’s Osun State primary election to qualify for participation in the sald 1st Defendant’s primary election.”

A declaration that by virtue of the Oyetola’s failure to resign or leave his office as a member of the CECPC at least 30 days before the Primary he was “disqualified from contesting in the said primary election of 19th February, 2022.

He further sought a declaration that Oyetola having participated in the primary “is a grave violation or breach of the principle of audi alterem partem and Nemo judex in causa sua”

Other reliefs are “a declaration that the 2nd Defendant is disqualified from contesting as an aspirant in the 1st Defendant’s Osun State Governorship primary of 19th February, 2022 in Osun State.

“A declaration that all the votes cast in favour of the 2nd Defendant in the 1st Defendant’s Osun State Governorship Primary of 19th February, 2022 are invalid and/or throw away votes and/or wasted votes., the 2nd Defendant being unqualified to contest in the said Primaries.

Electoral Act Amendment: Buhari to sign bill tomorrow,"From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari will at about noon on Friday assent to the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, sources in the presidency said, yesterday.

Twenty six civil society organisations (CSOs) had on Tuesday held a national day of protest calling on President Buhari to sign the bill into law.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in a statement recent statement had said Buhari having received the amended Bill on January 31, 2022, still had up till March 1 to assent to the bill as prescribed by the constitution.

However, sources in the presidency, revealed that arrangements had been concluded for the president to sign the bill into law on Friday, putting paid to all anxieties expressed by Nigerians.

“All the anxieties will disappear by Friday afternoon. He will be signing the bill around noon of that day. I believe he has taken his time so that the Act can be as unassailable as much as possible,” said the official who preferred not to be named.

President Buhari had withheld his assent to the bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct party primaries as provided by the National Assembly in the amended Act and the associated security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political players as part of the reasons for his decision.

He, however, gave some conditions to give his assent, prompting the lawmakers to re-work the bill which led to the inclusion of direct, indirect and consensus options for party primaries in the new bill.

Meanwhile, Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodimma has described as unnecessary the worries expressed by some Nigerians that President Muhammadu Buhari was delaying his assent to the amended Electoral Act as passed by the National Assembly.

Addressing the media in his office, yesterday, the governor said the hullabaloo over the shift on the date from Wednesday (February 23, 2022) to Friday (February 25, 2022) for the signing of the amended Electoral Act was uncalled for and the anxiety unnecessary “as President Buhari has ample time within the constitutional provision to assent the amended document into law.”

To give Nigerians the best, the president has to study the Amended Act before signing it into law, and if in the process he discovers things in the Act that are not in the interest of the people of Nigeria he has the constitutional mandate to move it back to the National Assembly for corrections before his assent.

“The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has expressly defined the processes a Bill or an Act must undergo before the President will consider it for assent and to the best of my knowledge as a parliamentarian none of those processes has been violated by Mr. President.

“The president should be allowed to do his job without being put under unnecessary pressure, particularly the worries and anxiety expressed by some Nigerians, especially through the media.”

Governor Uzodimma also explained that the Friday date should not also be seen to be sacrosanct, because the 30 days window from the time the amended Act was returned to the president still subsists.

Uzodimma advised Nigerians who are worried to understand that “there are very many other issues that call for attention of both the President and the National Assembly, what is before the President is an Amended Electoral Act and at the appropriate time the President will Assent to it.”

Commenting on the rescheduled All Progressives Congress (APC) Convention, the Governor said there was nothing to worry about.","From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, AbujaPresident Muhammadu Buhari will at about noon on Friday assent to the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, sources in the presidency said, yesterday.

"Rising Oil Prices Worry FG, Says Nigeria Not Gaining from Soaring Rates","•Sylva: Nigeria’s comfort zone is $70-$80

•Fuel scarcity: NNPC distributes 387.5m litres of petrol in one week

Emmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akoje in Abuja

The federal government yesterday expressed concern over the rising international prices of crude oil, saying the increase is not good for the country.

The government bemoaned waning foreign investment in the oil and gas sector, and reiterated the need to float an African Energy Bank to curb the continent’s dependence on Europe, Asia and America for funding.

Also, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited yesterday released details of how it distributed a total of 387.59 million litres of petrol in the last one week to bridge the gap caused by the withdrawal of methanol-blended products in circulation.

This was as the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream investigating the importation of off-spec premium motor spirit (PMS) grilled other importers and suppliers of the product.

Speaking on the rising crude oil prices in an interview with Bloomberg Television, monitored by THISDAY, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, maintained that Nigeria’s comfort zone in terms of oil prices was between $70 and $80 per barrel.

Although Sylva did not particularly explain why higher oil prices were bad for Nigeria, he stated that at the moment, Nigeria was not gaining anything from the soaring prices.

On the back of rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria’s benchmark, on Tuesday hit $99.03, the highest in the last nine years, almost touching the much-talked-about $100.

Clearly, the country’s controversial fuel subsidy regime, which would gulp N3 trillion this year, coupled with its inability to ramp up production to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have combined to limit the gains from the oil price hike.

However, Sylva blamed the inability of Nigeria to activate the oil wells it shut down when OPEC instructed producing countries to cut production as well as the lack of investment in the upstream sector for the country’s inability to increase production. At the moment, Nigeria is losing at least 300,000 bpd to its capacity challenges.

The minister stated, “I’m hopeful the prices will move around, maybe $80, maybe $70. We are hoping it will come down to somewhere around $70 to $80, which will be sustainable for us to the end of the year.

“We are working hard on that (production increase). What happened to us was the fact that we had to cut back at the time, and, of course, in such a way you can’t really cut back mathematically.

“So, you want to cut back 100,000 barrels that you shut out, maybe we’ll shut down about 200,000 to 300,000 barrels. So at the end of the day, we over-complied because we just couldn’t achieve it mathematically.

“In trying to cut down, we cut down too much. And now to come back, it’s not been easy for us to get the wells back to production.”

The minister noted that a lot of additional investments would be needed to ramp up production, but lamented that foreign funding was drying out for the industry.

“It’s not very easy these days to get the investments in. We really are not able to meet up our quota now. But I believe that we’re working so very hard to ensure that, because we are not happy at all.

“I mean, with the kind of prices we are seeing. We are obviously not happy about it. So we would like to definitely be back on track by later this year. It’s not been very easy to get investments. A lot of people can’t get investments into the sector.”

On what was being done to change the dire investment situation, Sylva stated that Africa was now beginning to realise that it could not be completely dependent on foreign funding.

He said, “So we’re looking at how we can get our African energy bank set up. Also, we’re looking at how we can rally multilateral funding into financial institutions.

“We are talking to Afreximbank. We’re working with other African producers to try to rally some funding for our sector in Africa, because we cannot continue to depend on funding that’s not coming.”

The minister reiterated that the world could not abandon fossil fuels when it had not built capacity to harness the alternative, noting that the decision to withdraw funding was hurting the industry and the countries of the world.

He said, “This is what we’ve been saying all the time. I mean that we have not been investing in the oil and gas sector for too long. And we expected that this was going to happen at some point, because there will be a gap, because now that gap cannot be filled by renewables.

“And that is because you are not also investing that quickly into renewables, you’re not developing renewables that quickly. So now there is a gap. And in addition to this gap, you have all the geopolitical tension.

“We are saying they must move gradually towards renewables, I mean, because if they take out the investment so quickly from fossil fuels, they cannot develop renewables at that same rate. That is what we are saying.”

Sylva further said he was not aware of discussions with the United States for Nigeria to increase supply of gas to Europe on the back of the Russia and Ukraine tensions, explaining that if it has to happen, it would take time and investment. But he explained that in the medium term, the country intended to begin supply to the continent through Algeria and Morocco.

Sylva said, “We are actually having those kinds of conversations with Algeria, we are building a pipeline, the Trans Sahara gas pipeline that is going to take up our gas all the way down to Algeria to Europe.

“We are also planning a pipeline to take our gas to Morocco. So we are planning two pipelines, one to Algeria, to Europe through Algeria, and one to Europe through Morocco.

“So we’re actually planning to take our gas to Europe. But I don’t know of any plan now to take gas to Europe because of the political tensions with Russia.”

On the Trans Sahara line, he stated that Nigeria had just signed with Algeria and had already started construction from the Nigerian end of the 614 kilometres AKK Pipeline, to take the pipeline all the way to Algeria to the border.

For the Morocco pipeline, he noted that it was still at the level of studies, with reports being expected.

“There’s a lot of excess capacity, but it will take some time to build the infrastructure and, of course, the LNG, it will also take a while. So, there is no spare capacity that we can immediately off-take to Europe now.”

Sylva, who spoke on the current OPEC supplies, stated that there was no need to increase quota at this time beyond the already agreed 400,000 bpd, which the cartel embarked upon last year.

He stressed that he planned to visit the headquarters of Chevron, ExxonMobil, ENI and the rest of the multinationals operating in Nigeria to get their commitments on additional investments in Nigeria, especially with the advent of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which has made investment more attractive.

Fuel Scarcity: NNPC Distributes 387.5m Litres of Petrol in One Week

The release of the document by NNPC coincided with the gradual easing of the long fuel queues, especially in Abuja, where traffic had been mostly grounded due to the closure of some roads by desperate motorists.

THISDAY observed that even the NNPC mega station along Olusegun Obasanjo Way, in Abuja, which had hitherto experienced intractable lines of vehicles before now, had lighter queues. At the Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar Way, in Wuse Zone 3, which for weeks did not have the product, motorists had also begun buying PMS.

Still in Abuja, retail outlets in the satellite towns, such as Bwari, Lugbe, Kubwa, Zuba, Kuje, and others, which hitherto witnessed product shortages, were seen dispensing petrol to motorists. The story was the same in some areas in Lagos and other major cities in the country.

NNPC said in a statement that the petrol bought by Nigerians through retail filling stations between February 14 and 20 represented an average daily distribution of 55.4 million litres. The weekly national evacuation report released showed that 80 per cent of all the petrol distribution took place at 20 high-loading depots, while 20 per cent took place at the others.

NNPC listed the top 20 high-loading depots used for distribution as Pinnacle-Lekki, which evacuated the highest volume of 70.8 million litres, and NIPCO, which distributed 22.6 million litres.

AITEO distributed 22.3 million litres; Swift, 16 million litres; 11 Plc, 15.9 million litres; Bovas Bulk, 15 million litres; and Frado 14.6 million litres.

Others were Keonamex, 13.7 million litres; MRS Ltd, 11.9 million litres; Rainoil 11.6 million litres; AYM Shafa, 11.2 million litres; TSL, 11.2 million litres; Rainoil Lagos, 11.2 million litres; and Matrix, 10 million litres.

Also on the list were Conoil Lagos, 9.7 million litres; AA Rano, 8.8 million litres; Bluefin, 8.4 million litres; HOGL, 8.2 million litres; Ibafon Calabar, 8 million litres; and Mainland, 7.5 million litres.

With the distribution of 385.59 million litres in one week, NNPC stated that scarcity of petrol was being arrested, with queues drastically reducing at filling stations in Abuja, Lagos, and other major cities.

According to the company, selling outlets that had been shut for over a week due to supply gap opened for operations since last Sunday.

The methanol-blended product, NNPC had earlier said, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four cargoes under NNPC’s Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) arrangement.

NNPC had last week promised that over 2.3 billion litres of the product would be delivered before the end of February 2022 to totally arrest the situation.

Group Executive Director, Downstream, of the national oil company, Mr. Adetunji Adeyemi, had further assured during a media briefing to announce the 2.3 billion litres expected cargoes, that Nigerians would heave a sigh of relief “in days.”

To lessen the pain and ensure that the long queues disappeared, Adeyemi stated that along with its partners, NNPC was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians can now buy the product round the clock at filling stations.

Furthermore, the executive director had announced that at the time, the country had over 1 billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe.

Many believe the bad fuel may have been fully withdrawn, as cargoes of clean petrol arrive the country daily to bridge the gap created by the withdrawal of the methanol-blended petrol.

NNPC further noted that a monitoring team had been set up with sister government agencies to ensure a seamless process, urging the security agencies to fully cooperate.

House Grills Other Suppliers, as Duke Oil, Oando Absolve Selves of Blame

The House of Representatives Committee on Downstream investigating the importation of off-spec petrol yesterday grilled other importers and suppliers of the off-spec fuel. The two oil companies, Duke Oil and Oando Plc, which were quizzed by the lawmakers, denied culpability in the importation of the bad fuel. Addressing the lawmakers, both companies said their product met the required Nigerian specification.

In his presentation, Managing Director of Duke Oil, Lawal Sade, said the product his company imported was certified okay both at the port of loading and the port of discharge by the relevant authorities. He said they were notified by NNPC a few hours after the discharge that the product had some particles, which made them to discontinue the process.

Sade said the company shared the pains Nigerians went through as a result of the discovery and quarantine of the methanol-blended PMS, adding that Duke Oil has already taken necessary steps to remedy the situation.

He told the House committee, “Mr Chairman, yes, there was a delivery of cargo by Duke Oil, like you have seen in the report, and that cargo met up with the Nigerian spec, as it is both at the loading and discharge ports. There was a confirmation by the regulator, which is the new Nigerian midstream, downstream authority, to discharge that cargo within the stipulated date.

“The cargo discharged and the vessel sailed. It was just after 24 hours of operation then, that Duke Oil was notified by the NNPC that there was a complaint from some of their customers that the cargo had some particles

“So, Mr. Chairman, with the notification from PPMC/NNPC, immediately, the management of Duke Oil authorised the NNPC not to evacuate the cargo any further and requested for a recertification. But it is important we reiterate the fact that the cargo has been certified by the midstream and then, there is a joint inspection before the discharge and the specification provided in the contract with NNPC meet up the Nigerian specification.”

He further said, “And then, some remedial actions were taken immediately, Mr. Chairman, to conclude the report and give an assurance to this House committee and, indeed, all Nigerians that Duke Oil, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the NNPC and commercially driven company, we are not just in business to make money, but also to guarantee the energy security of our great nation and we never compromise the quality of the product we supply to Nigeria and any other place we do business and we will always seek to maintain this positive position.”

On its part, Oando Plc representative, Afanga Afanga, also said their product met the Nigerian specification.

Afanga stated, “In line with our DSSP contract with the NNPC on January 16, 2022, we delivered 90MT worth of PMS on board the Vessel MT Elka Apollon. It is important to note that this PMS cargo that was supplied met and was in line with all the Nigerian and DSDP contractual specifications.

“This was confirmed by the mandatory tests that were conducted at the loading port in Europe and before discharge in Nigeria by independent NNPC quality inspectors and finally by agents of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority. It is on this basis that the cargo was certified and accepted for discharge by NNPC.

“As clearly stated by NNPC last week, when they were before this committee, its current inspection protocol does not include testing for methanol content and, thus, was not detected by the NNPC quality inspectors.

“The most important thing at this juncture for us is to work with NNPC as we are committed to ensuring that what is brought into the country is well treated and the issues around the situation are alleviated for Nigerians.

“We have given assurances and we have also been able to show to be following the right protocol and there was nothing that was breached as being alleged.”

Responding, the chairman of the committee, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, asked the companies to submit all relevant documents regarding their presentations, adding that they may be re-invited if necessary.

APC Zoning Presidency to South Puts PDP in Quandary,"•Bala Mohammed: Ruling party’s decision constitutes no threat to us

Obinna Chima and James Sowole in Abeokura

The decision, Tuesday, by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country, might have put the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a quandary for contemplating to leave its own ticket open and by implication, put the north at advantage.

But the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, yesterday, reinforced the PDP position, when he declared that the zoning of the presidency to the South by the ruling party posed no threat to the main opposition party ahead of the 2023 general election.

His reaction may however underscore a concern in the party even though he tried to put a brave face on it.

Unfortunately for the PDP, the APC seems to be playing a rather smarter card, given the current mood of the nation, and especially, because while most of the governors in both parties wanted power to shift to the south of Nigeria, the governors, being life of the political parties, are consciously working to the answer.

Although in the PDP, such leaders like former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, are among those, who want the PDP ticket thrown open. The Southern PDP governors are also inclined to power shift.

However, the possibility that the PDP too might still go South is high, because once the party had zoned its chairmanship to the North, it is only ideal that its presidential ticket is taken South, a situation that would further give the APC an advantage of southern votes.

This is not to dismiss the understanding alleged to have been reached by PDP leaders at the point of making Dr. Iyorchia Ayu the national chairman of party, that if the equation changed at the point of choosing a presidential candidate, the chairman would resign if interests clashed.

Interestingly, and based on simple logic, many of the PDP governors knew that the APC would have an advantage in the south if the presidency was zoned to the south.

But the danger in this is that the party could lose the votes of some northern states as THISDAY had previously extrapolated, a development that could automatically put states like Rivers, Delta and Akwa Ibom in play for the APC that is fielding a Southern candidate.

What this means is that with a Southern presidential candidate by the ruling APC and without a concurrent Southern presidential standard bearer in the PDP, those key oil-rich Southern states could be won by APC, while not losing much ground in the north.

Another factor that many are currently considering as likely to work in favour of the APC is the Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso’s national movement, otherwise known as the third force.

The movement could divide the PDP further as well as shave valuable votes from the PDP in the North. In other words, the advantage the PDP hopes to gain in the north by potentially fielding a Northerner might be significantly eroded by Kwankwaso’s third force.

This, nonetheless, Mohammed, who spoke with journalists, shortly after a meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the PDP would continue to strategise to rescue Nigeria from the present situation she has found herself.

The governor, who described Obasanjo as a man with a lot of wisdom and an elder statesman per excellence, said he had come to seek his opinion on some of the things going on in the party.

His words: “To me, the zoning of Presidency to the South by the APC is not a threat to the PDP, because each party is trying to strategise, to plan and organise. If they zone to the South, it is open to us to see how it is going to give us more electoral victory or if we put it to the North, it will give us more electoral victory.

“This is the kind of things we are doing: the leg works, the permutations and so and so forth. So that, at least, whatever we are going to do, is to provide for Nigerians to choose between the best alternatives.”

While stressing the past relationship with Obasanjo, Mohammed said the issue of PDP, was basically one of the reasons for his visit.

He said, “We know that Baba is non-partisan; we know he is an elder statesman per excellence. But, we are rebuilding our party to remove rancour, division and so on. So, we still need him, because his words of wisdom are always very useful.

“So, I have come to sound his opinion on some of the things going on in the party; to close ranks and make sure that we provide Nigerians with the opportunity to rescue the country, from the present division going around, which we have found ourselves,” he said.

The Bauchi governor expressed optimism about his chances of getting the PDP presidential ticket to contest the 2023 election.

He said, “To me, presidency is a consensus – a stakeholder and a statesmanship – it is responsibilities. Of course, every Nigerian should try to contribute his or her quota to the growth and development of the nation.

“More so, when leadership recruitment should be based on merit, should be based on making sure that, we bring everybody on board and should not be based on manifestation of separatist, which are the instruments and the disgruntlement that are capable of dividing us further.

“Nigeria is too large and too important to be ignored. Some of us have benefited so much. It is not about me and my expression, but about the country.”

"EXCLUSIVE: New Group in APC Cabal Moves To Bury Tinubu, Emefiele’s 2023 Presidential Ambitions, Adopts Ex-President Jonathan To Be Consensus Candidate","A new group in the cabal of the All Progressives Congress has asked ex-President Goodluck Jonathan to contest for President in 2023, a move that will bury the presidential ambition of former Lagos State governor and APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, SaharaReporters has learnt.



The new APC group, SaharaReporters further gathered on Wednesday, prefers former President Jonathan to be the party’s candidate in the 2023 presidential election, which will also see the presidential ambition of the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, be buried altogether.

CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele

SaharaReporters learnt that a former Minister of Defence, Gen. T.Y. Danjuma (retd.), was one of those who met with Buhari to oppose Emefiele’s presidential ambition.



“A new group in the APC cabals has ruined Emefiele’s plans as they asked ex-president Jonathan to contest and that he will be selected by consensus. They are assuring that there would not even be primaries.



“The plan is meant to finally put Bola Tinubu’s ambition to rest,” a top source privy to the developments revealed.

SaharaReporters had in January 2022 reported that against widespread belief that President Buhari was preparing to hand over power to Tinubu or Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in May 2023, he might be looking in another direction.



Buhari was reported to have reached out to Jonathan on taking over power from him and was already working with some of his most trusted lieutenants to actualise this plan.



A trusted source around the President had told SaharaReporters that the idea had already received the backing of some prominent politicians from the North, including state governors as the arrangement would enable power to return to the region in 2027 when Jonathan would have served out his single four-year term after previously occupying same position from 2011 to 2015.

President Buhari and Jonathan had met a week earlier before that time and according to the source, modalities of this new arrangement were discussed at length with further meetings to take place in the coming weeks to cement plans to help achieve the target.



“Pressure came from two Northern governors for President Buhari to allow Jonathan to complete his term and return power to the North for another eight years beginning from 2027,” the source had revealed.



“It is for this reason that Buhari had requested Jonathan to see him last Thursday following the conclusion of discussion with the two governors, one of whom is Mai Mala Buni of Yobe and APC Caretaker Committee Chairman.



“This same Buni worked against Tinubu's interest in the electoral act to ensure Buhari did not sign it. Tinubu had hoped to ward off challenge from Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi and others to get the APC presidential ticket through direct primaries.



“Buni is also working to organise national convention to create substantive national executives, all a ploy to ensure a Jonathan candidacy. He's masterminding a likely micro-zoning to the South-South to ensure Jonathan is the sole aspirant during the primary.



“Following the successful meeting on Thursday with Buhari, Jonathan has also moved swiftly to hold a strategic meeting with South-South ministers and will hold a national ministers' meeting under his government afterwards as a prequel to a formal declaration.



“The meeting which held under the South-South 2023 Presidency group headed by Jonathan's associate, Mr Dikivie Ikiogha, took place at Mrs Patience Jonathan's Aridolf Hotels and Spars.



“If the plan goes well, Jonathan will choose a serving Northern governor as running mate.

Appeal court affirms Farouk Lawan’s conviction -- but reduces jail term,"The court of appeal in Abuja has affirmed the conviction of Farouk Lawan, former lawmaker, over the $3 million bribery charges preferred against him by the federal government.

Lawan was the chairman of the house of representatives ad hoc committee probing the multi-billion naira petrol subsidy fraud in 2012.

He was accused of demanding $3 million from Femi Otedola to remove Zenon Petroleum and Gas Limited (Otedola’s former company) from the list of oil companies allegedly involved in the petrol subsidy fraud in 2012.

Lawan, who was arraigned on seven counts of bribery by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), was alleged to have collected a $500,000 bribe from Otedola.

The charge was later amended to three counts.

On June 22, 2021, Angela Otaluka, judge of a federal capital territory high court in Apo, convicted the accused on all three counts and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment.

However, delivering judgment in the appeal filed by the convict, the court discharged and acquitted the former lawmaker on two out of the three counts on which he was convicted.

"Rising oil prices not good for Nigeria, says Sylva","Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, says the increase in prices of global crude oil is not good for the country.

Speaking on the rising crude oil prices in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Sylva said that Nigeria’s comfort zone in terms of oil prices was between $70 and $80 per barrel.

On Thursday, the global oil benchmark, Brent crude, rose over 5 percent to trade at $102.27 a barrel with escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

The minister said Nigeria was not gaining anything from the soaring prices.

TheCable had reported that subsidy burden, pipeline shutdowns are among the reasons why Nigeria is not benefitting from high crude oil prices.

“I’m hopeful the prices will move around, maybe $80, maybe $70. We are hoping it will come down to somewhere around $70 to $80, which will be sustainable for us to the end of the year,” he said.

Last year, Nigeria agreed to voluntarily cut its daily crude oil production by 939,000 barrels between January and March after a meeting with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies.

TheCable had reported how subsidy payments, pipeline shutdowns affected Nigeria from benefitting from high crude oil prices.

Sylva said the inability of Nigeria to activate the oil wells it shut down when OPEC instructed producing countries to cut production as well as the lack of investment in the upstream sector is affecting the country’s ability to increase production.

He said Nigeria is losing at least 300,000 bpd to its capacity challenge.

“We are working hard on that (production increase). What happened to us was the fact that we had to cut back at the time, and, of course, in such a way you can’t cut back mathematically,” he said.

“So, you want to cut back 100,000 barrels that you shut out, maybe we’ll shut down about 200,000 to 300,000 barrels. So, at the end of the day, we over-complied because we just couldn’t achieve it mathematically.

“In trying to cut down, we cut down too much. And now to come back, it’s not been easy for us to get the wells back to production.”

According to the minister, a lot of additional investments would be needed to ramp up production, but he lamented that foreign funding was drying fizzling out for the industry.

Answering questions on the supply of gas to Europe, Sylva said he was not aware of discussions with the United States for Nigeria to increase the supply of gas to Europe amid Russia and Ukraine tensions.

According to him, if it has to happen, it would take time and investment.

He said the country intended to begin supply to the continent through Algeria and Morocco in the near term.","Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, says the increase in prices of global crude oil is not good for the country.

"Russia-Ukraine war: Be responsible for your safety, Nigerian embassy tells citizens","The Nigerian embassy in Ukraine has asked Nigerians residing in Ukraine to remain calm and be responsible for their personal security amid the Russia invasion.

Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, had announced a special military operation in Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Shortly after Putin’s announcement, explosions were reportedly heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kramatorsk and in other parts of Ukraine.

Earlier, the Russian president had ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what he called a “peacekeeping” mission — after signing decrees recognising the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.

The development has caused apprehension among Nigerians who are currently residing in Ukraine, especially students.

Reacting to the development, the Nigerian embassy in Kiev, in a statement on Thursday, asked Nigerian nationals who want to temporarily relocate from Ukraine to ensure they validate their resident documents for ease of return.

The embassy added that it remains open for consular duties for Nigerians who decide to stay in Ukraine during the crisis.

“In view of this development, the embassy urges Nigerian nationals resident in Ukraine to remain calm but be very vigilant and be responsible for their personal security and safety,” the statement reads.

“The embassy wishes to add that should any Nigerian nationals consider the situation as emotionally disturbing, such nationals may wish to temporarily relocate to anywhere considered safe by private arrangements.

“They should, however, ensure that they do all the needful to validate all their resident documents for ease of return to the country when desired.

”In addition, in case of students seeking such temporary relocation, they are enjoined to seek proper clearance and guarantee from their respective institutions, authorities/agents on the way forward in respect to their studies during this period and/or thereafter.”","The Nigerian embassy in Ukraine has asked Nigerians residing in Ukraine to remain calm and be responsible for their personal security amid the Russia invasion.

The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit,"Share this article:













If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that our online data is being tracked, one way or the other. From the sites we visit to the apps we download, there’s a lot we share on Obasanjo’s Internet — inadvertently or not — that end up in the most unlikely places.

Let’s put this in perspective, say you want to buy your dad a birthday gift. You go to your favourite eCommerce store and pick out some shoes and a nice wristwatch, but you aren’t ready to pay. So you add it to your cart and decide to wait till salary week. After all, dad’s birthday is not for a couple of months.

You clock off the website and go back to your favourite game. Two minutes into the game, you see an ad for some men’s shoes and even a suit. Strange? Maybe not.

Some say data privacy is a myth, and in a world where the free online services you enjoy require some information in exchange for your non-payment, you might be tempted to agree — sometimes I am too.

In the last four years, since the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) began, some headway has been made to protect personal data. The use of cookies, emphasis on consent, elaborate — but still insufficient — rules on data processing, transfer, and tracking are receiving attention.

Big tech companies have become the subject of extreme scrutiny. They have had to backtrack and find ways to protect user privacy due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing.

As of December 2021, per Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free. On the Apple App store, that number goes down to 94%.

In April 2021, Apple finally implemented its App Tracking Transparency privacy policy which meant app developers needed to seek the consent of users before their data could be tracked or given to a third party.

Before this, Apple allowed app developers to track user data either through its Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA) or using their own trackers. With ATT, however, once a user chooses to opt-out, app creators would have no access to the IDFA and are urged not to track them on their own.













Source: The Verge

For privacy advocates and enthusiasts, this was a welcome development. As we’ve discussed in previous articles, consent is one of the fundamental tenets in protecting online privacy. Seeing it put front and centre brought tears of joy to the eyes.

But not everyone was on board with this. For companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), whose 2021 revenue was 97% ads, this was most definitely a stumbling block. With 98.5% of Facebook users accessing the platform via mobile phones, this was, of course, quite worrying.

So, in February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for “small businesses everywhere.” However, this was not enough to save them because, by October 2021, investigations by Financial Times showed that Meta, Snap, Twitter, and Google’s YouTube had lost $10 billion in revenue due to Apple’s ATT.

Interestingly, Meta believes that they could lose upwards of $10 billion in revenue due to the ATT by the end of 2022.

However, while Meta’s actions in February 2021 might not have been entirely altruistic, it did have a point. Meta is the second-biggest digital ad platform after Google. It is heavily relied upon by pretty much everyone for data to run ads and gain insights into customer satisfaction and usage.

From publishers to small and medium scale businesses to large corporations, advertising is an essential source of revenue. And to run the targeted ads which Meta promises, real-time/recent data is critical.

The question now is, how can these companies balance the competing needs of privacy and profit-making?

A sandbox, but for privacy













Plotting the privacy graph

As of January 2022, 83% of smartphone users in Africa use Android; 70% worldwide. And on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, in a blog post, Google announced that it would be extending its Privacy Sandbox to Android.

According to Google, “The Privacy Sandbox initiative aims to create technologies that both protect people’s privacy online and give companies and developers tools to build thriving digital businesses. The Privacy Sandbox reduces cross-site and cross-app tracking while helping to keep online content and services free for all.”

Since its inception in 2019, Google’s Privacy Sandbox has been mired in controversy. Considering that the company is the largest digital ad platform on the planet and is said to track user behaviour over two-thirds of the Internet, issues were bound to arise.

In January 2022, the company announced that it was scrapping the controversial Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) and introducing Topics. FLoCs was Google’s plan to phase out cookies using technology that aggregated users into groups of users with similar interests.

Side Note: This excerpt from this article by the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains the issues surrounding the use of FLoCs. TL;DR It was a big tattoo on your digital forehead because it tracked your Chrome browser history.

Side Side Note: Unlike my favourite chocolate chip snacks, cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Using our earlier example, cookies made it easy for them to target those ads at you after logging off the eCommerce website.

By extending the Privacy Sandbox to Android phones, Google introduces four tools into the equation: Topics, Fledge, SDK Runtime, and Attribution Reporting. These are expected to replace the need for the Google Ad ID (GA ID) — the equivalent of Apple’s IDFA; although the GA ID is expected to be operational for two more years.

According to Daniel Junowicz, Managing Director of LATAM & Africa at AppsFlyer, “The announcement of the deployment of Google’s Privacy Sandbox on Android is an expected continuation of an ecosystem that continues to prioritise user privacy.

“Since Apple’s ATT Framework set the tone for these changes last year, the mobile marketing landscape has continued to innovate and embrace privacy-privacy preserving ways to drive mobile marketing performance.”

X-raying these tools













Google Topics

In this video by Debby Reynolds, data privacy & protection expert strategist, she gives a high-level explanation of these four tools. According to her, these tools could “create less asymmetry in the relationship between consumers and marketers” while still providing some level of information to the marketers.

Topics is a bit similar to FLoCs in that it categorises your interests based on your browsing history. Currently, Google says there are 300 human-curated topics, and it would be adding to the list as it goes on.

Topics gives you the option to delete topics that are associated with you. In addition, when you first visit a site that has integrated the Topics API, you can choose which topics you are interested in on the website. This helps target specific people without revealing specifics like age, gender, or race for ad companies.

Say one of the Topics is ‘Food” using our earlier example. If the eCommerce website had integrated the Topics API, you could have chosen only to be associated with Food and would not have seen any ads relating to suits or shoes once you logged off.

Fledge gives ad companies access to a custom audience of customers that have expressed interest in a particular product before or have bought a product before.

Attribution Reporting prevents companies from getting specific data of a customer that bought a product. So say after you received your salary, you went on to buy your dad the shoes and wristwatch; Google would prevent the ad company from seeing that it was Sophia who lives on 61, Opebi Road, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria that bought a gold wristwatch and size 43 male shoes.

Side Note: Attribution is a way for ad companies to gain bonus points for ads that have converted. Basically, if you buy a product through an ad that was targeted at you, the ad company can use this to gain brownie points and know which ads work or not.

SDK Runtime is a firewalled section of the phone to isolate ad tools to limit their ability to see and record what people do. An SDK (software development kit) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system, or programming language.

They help developers focus on running their own programme without worrying about having expertise in things like ads or analytics.

Balancing privacy and profit















Google’s stake in the ad industry seems to have informed much of what it has proposed. Unlike Apple’s “one size fits all” approach, Google’s method appears to be more balanced and considerate of all parties.

Google says it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to finetune the Privacy Sandbox as this is not the final iteration. According to the company, this would take a couple of years before it is ready for implementation.

Meanwhile, Android users can manage activity on their Google dashboard and delete web and app activity or location history or whatever they wish to keep anonymous.

Reynolds advises that companies find ways to increase their first-party data using giveaways to help foster that.

As she says, “Nothing stops companies from providing incentives to develop first-party relationships with consumers. I think businesses that cannot show how this data exchange benefits consumers will have a hard time getting people to give them data.”

A position Junowicz holds, “For Android mobile marketers, having the right technology in place will be crucial in order to continue generating valuable insights without compromising on privacy. For example, the use of predictive measurement solutions in conjunction with creative approaches will be vital to retain, engage and monetise users while providing personalised user experience in a privacy-compliant environment.

“In addition, the development of data cleanroom technologies will offer a neutral, safe space for multiple entities to collaborate using first-party user data.’’

Side Note: First-party data is information a company collects directly from its customers and owns.

This would, of course, lead to more companies having to comply with data protection regulations and perhaps better data protection and privacy policies.

However, these actions serve to further cement Google’s and Apple’s hold on the industry. Something to chew on and perhaps worry about.

TradeDepot acquires Green Lion













TradeDepot. Source: Supplied

Since my induction into the tech ecosystem, I’ve considered the African market unprepared for eCommerce.

However, recent investments, acquisitions, and a renewed business model is boosting my confidence in the sector.

While we are on the topic, African eCommerce and embedded finance platform, TradeDepot has acquired Green Lion, Ghanaian B2B eCommerce startup.

This comes two months after TradeDepot raised $110 million in equity and debt financing to offer its buy now, pay later (BNPL) services for African informal businesses.

TradeDepot has a presence in Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana. And this acquisition sees the absorption of a significant Ghanaian competitor in a $24.4 billion retail market.

Twinning: Founded in 2018, Green Lion digitises the operations of neighbourhood retailers and ensures a constant supply of essential goods. Interestingly, both companies operate the same B2B eCommerce model.

TradeDepot wants to leverage Green Lion’s data, technology, and robust logistics to connect more neighbourhood retailers in Ghana to suppliers.

A profitable model? TradeDepot has grown the merchants on its platform by 150% — 40,000 to 100,000 — in just one year. Its B2B model combined with its BNPL feature allows retailers to get goods without payment.

Currently, the B2B eCommerce model appears to be the rave of the moment, with platforms like Alerzo, Omnibiz, and Marketforce playing in the space.

Nigerian data science startup, Voyance, has raised $500,000 in a pre-seed round led by Beta.Ventures.

What does Voyance do? Founded in 2019 by Ebot Tabi and current Mono CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, the startup provides a no-code data infrastructure for businesses. The platform requires little to no data science expertise to analyse essential data.

In a 2019 interview with Techpoint Africa, Hassan described the company as “a machine learning platform which allows businesses to upload their data and predict what matters to them.”

In addition to the pre-seed raise, Voyance has also launched two flagship products, Manhattan DB and Sigma. Per Benjamin Dada, Manhattan DB can help data scientists and engineers process large data and build machine learning models.

Its second flagship product is a risk operations platform that can help businesses discover and address problems.

Ovo Emorhokpor, General Partner, Beta.Ventures reiterated the startup’s mission to simplify and democratise access to data science.

He said, “Voyance is building critical infrastructure to enable small and large businesses to turn their raw data into advanced analytics and design machine learning models to make insightful business predictions.”

Oil crosses $100 for first time since 2014 after Russia orders troops into Ukraine,"Oil crosses $100 for first time since 2014 after Russia orders troops into Ukraine

Brent oil surged past $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 as Russia’s dramatic escalation of the Ukraine crisis sparked fears of a disruption to the region’s critical energy exports.

Futures in London jumped as much as 3.3% after a report that President Vladimir Putin’s bloody gamble to conduct a special operation to “protect” the Donbas region before falling back below the key threshold.

Putin announced this week he’d send “peacekeeping forces” into the two separatist regions recognized by Moscow, heightening fears among western governments of a full-blown invasion of Ukraine.

In a nationally televised address early Thursday, Putin appealed to Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and go home. He said Russia doesn’t plan to “occupy” its southern neighbor, but that Russia must “defend itself from those who took Ukraine hostage” — the U.S. and its allies who had crossed Russia’s “red line” with expansion of the NATO alliance.

President Joe Biden called the move “an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces” and said the “world will hold Russia accountable.” Biden added that he would meet his Group of Seven counterparts Thursday and then speak to the American people to announce further punishments that would be placed on Moscow.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.”

Russia is a key supplier of energy to global customers, with Europe relying on the nation for about a quarter of its oil supplies and a third of its gas.

The escalation spooked a market that was already under stress, as oil supplies around the world fail to keep pace with the vigorous recovery in demand from the pandemic.

The OPEC+ coalition led by Saudi Arabia is struggling to restore production quickly enough, prompting some of the biggest market players to warn of an increasingly tight market.

Oil prices are likely to average $110 in the second quarter as tensions over Ukraine continue to escalate, said JPMorgan Chase & Co. this week.

The crude market is likely to see sustained higher prices in the next quarter, before retreating to average $90 at the end of the year, it said.

The Biden administration is considering tapping its emergency supply of oil again in coordination with allies to counter a surge in prices brought on by Russia’s moves against Ukraine.

The White House earlier announced sanctions on some Russian banks, sovereign debt and elites.

Crude’s return to triple digits completes a prodigious recovery — barely imaginable a year ago — as the market flips from surplus to scarcity. It reflects a global economy rushing back to normality from Covid-19 faster than it can secure supplies of raw materials of all kinds.

“As demand recovers to pre-Covid levels, supply is really having a hard time,” said Giovanni Serio, global head of market analysis at Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader.","Oil crosses $100 for first time since 2014 after Russia orders troops into UkraineBrent oil surged past $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 as Russia’s dramatic escalation of the Ukraine crisis sparked fears of a disruption to the region’s critical energy exports.

"BUA Foods, Notore, UPDC on track to sell controlling shares","In a bid to make more of their equities available to the investing public, newly listed BUA Foods plc, Notore Chemical Industries plc, UPDC plc and Transcorp Hotels plc are among the seven companies that have set timelines to sell down the shares of their controlling investors.

Other companies that have provided their compliance timelines are Arbico plc, LivingTrust Mortgage Bank plc, and Prestige Assurance plc.

The NGX Regulation Limited’s (NGX RegCo) X-Compliance Report shows that no fewer than 21 listed companies on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) have majority of their shares still in the hands of controlling-interest investors as against being in the hands of public investors thereby making them deficient in the free-float requirement in line with listing rules.

What is a free float?

Free float represents the portion of shares of a corporation that is in the hands of public investors as opposed to locked-in shares held by promoters, company officers or controlling-interest investors. It provides a more accurate reflection of what public investors consider the company to be worth.

The float is calculated by subtracting the locked-in shares from outstanding shares. For example, a company may have 20 million outstanding shares, with 6 million of them in a locked-in position; this company’s float would be 14 million.

For instance, the listing of BUA Foods on the NGX creates access for public participation in the ownership of the company, contributes to the growth of the NGX and positions the company to access long-term capital.

They are to provide quarterly disclosure reports

“The Board of NGX RegCo considered and approved an extended time frame for the companies to regain compliance with the listings requirement. The companies are however required to also provide quarterly disclosure reports to NGX RegCo detailing their level of implementation of the compliance plans,” the report stated. BusinessDay check shows that only seven companies (about 33.3%) of the 21 companies the NGX Regulation Limited (NGX RegCo) listed provided their compliance due dates.

“The listing creates liquidity and tradability of BUA Foods’ shares for existing shareholders and an opportunity for the public to participate in the growth of BUA Foods. The liquidity and tradability will create price discovery for the shares over time.

“The Exchange has very thorough Corporate Governance standards that all listed entities must align with. BUA Foods is already dedicated to best Corporate Governance practices. The Listing provides a chance for the Company to further ensure transparency across its operations,” Ayodele Abioye, acting managing director, BUA Foods, said at the Facts Behind the Listing presentation.

The companies’ shares outstanding as against free float

These companies, their free float percentage and compliance due dates include Arbico (19.96%/June 15, 2023). Arbico, which has 148.5 million shares outstanding, trades at N1.03 per share on Tuesday, February 22. The company is listed on the building construction subsector of the Construction/Real Estate sector of NGX.

Shares outstanding refers to the total number of shares a company has issued, while the free floats are its shares that are publicly owned, unrestricted and available on the open market.

BUA Foods, which is listed on the foods products subsector of the Consumer Goods sector, trades at N61.4 per share. BUA Foods has outstanding shares of 18 billion units. BUA Foods free float is 0.17 percent and its timeline for compliance is January 4, 2023. The company on January 5, 2022, listed by introduction on the Main Board of The Exchange its 18 billion shares at N40 per share.

Here are banks that offer loans without collateral,"Here are banks that offer loans without collateral

Some Nigerian Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) are pushing for unsecured lending, a loan that does not require collateral, as demand rises among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and households.

As seen in the latest data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), demand for unsecured lending has been on the rise but lower than the demand in the pre-COVID-19 years.

The CBN’s latest consumer credit report shows that demand for unsecured credit cards lending rose to 9.4 index points in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020 from 4.9 points in the first quarter of the same year.

BusinessDay’s visit to some agency banking operators reveals that one of their challenges is on how to get loans without interest to expand their businesses.

“If we can get cash in terms of non-interest loans from the bank, it will help me to meet the rising demand for cash by my customers,” a woman (Mrs Lawal) who sells drinks in addition to PoS operations, told BusinessDay on Tuesday.

However, here are some of the banks that offer loans without collateral as seen in their websites. They include Access Bank, which offers up to N10 million without collateral to SMEs; Fidelity Bank (N10m), First Bank (N10m), GTBank (N30m), Polaris Bank (N10m), Standard Chartered Bank (N20m), Union Bank (N50m), and Zenith Bank (N10m), among others.

“Whether you are a school owner, a health practitioner or you are into IT, or any other business you can access up to N10 million without collateral,” according to the banks.

Standard Chartered Bank recently launched a product known as Smart Business Loan (SBL), a non-secured lending product, targeted at supporting the growth of SMEs, David Idoru, head, consumer, private and business banking, noted.

“At Union Bank, we support your whole value chain of suppliers and buyers with short-term loans for SMEs that are key and sub-distributors,” the bank stated.

Union Bank offers Cash Flow Lending, which is a working capital to help meet short-term business needs of customers. Its features include no collateral required, affordable interest rate, maximum tenor of 12 months, maximum loan amount of N10 million.

The bank also offers invoice discounting Finance Quick cash flow for businesses, featuring no collateral, affordable interest rate, and maximum amount of N50 million.

Z-Woman is Zenith Bank’s (N10m) single-digit loan product for female-owned businesses for all sectors primarily geared toward growing the SME sub-sector and diversifying its customer base.

The loan is for female-owned businesses with shareholding of 50 percent or any majority shareholding provided it is owned by a woman.

According to the CBN’s latest data, availability of unsecured credit provided to households increased in Q4 ‘2020 and is expected to increase in Q1 ‘2021. Improving economic outlook and increased market share objective were contributory factors for the increase.

As lenders resolve to tighten the credit scoring criterion for total unsecured loan applications in Q4 ‘2020, the proportion of approved total loan applications for households increased. Lenders expect to also tighten the credit scoring criteria in Q1 2021 and anticipate that the proportion of approved loan applications will also increase.","Here are banks that offer loans without collateralSome Nigerian Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) are pushing for unsecured lending, a loan that does not require collateral, as demand rises among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and households.

Abudu – A non-governmental organisation, under the aegis of Abudu Diaspora Group (ADG) said it would commence the second phase installations of solar streetlights at Abudu, administrative headquarters of Orhionmwon local government area of Edo state soon.

The group which had earlier installed about 250 solar streetlights across Abudu in January said it intends to reach out to areas in the community that are yet to benefit from the project.

A leader of the group, Eghosa-Kings Igbinoghodua who made this know to our correspondent recently via a telephone chat said, “we want to ensure it (solar streetlights) goes round to the people. Also, there are some of the installations done on wooden poles; we plan to change them with concrete poles.”

Igbinoghodua maintained that, apart from the solar streetlighting, the group would support health centers in the community, to boost healthcare delivery.

According to Igbinoghodua, healthcare is a huge challenge in Nigeria, hence they plan to render the needed assistance to the medical facilities.

Igbinoghodua who disclosed that the Abudu diaspora group has commenced formal registration with Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) dissociated the group from ‘Abudu G.R.A project’.

“Some people in this group are trying to get land from Abudu elders which they say they are going to build as G.R.A, we are not part of the group, because we told them not to do it”, he said

However, initiator of the GRA project, Godwin Igho-oga Imafidon explained that the project is targeted at developing a ‘GRA’ at Abudu towards the realization of ‘Abudu must move forward’ development slogan.

“the project will serve the housing interest of “all Abudu indigenes both at home and in diaspora and also serve our neighboring communities of Evbuobanosa, Evbohen, Iru, Oza, Ogan, Iguiya etc and indeed every Orhionmwon indigene who will like to live away from the hustles and bristles of the city while taking advantage of Abudu proximity to Benin and the Express highway, while at the same time encouraging urban rural drift”, Imafidon stated

He added that Abudu diaspora group and the Abudu GRA project group were formed for the overall development of Abudu having realized the need to give back to the community where members were born and raised.

It is expected that the Abudu diasporans come together under one umbrella to forge a common front, as the various projects embarked on would be for the development of Abudu, and by extension Orhionmwon.

Brent crude hits $100 as Russia invades Ukraine,"Oil prices rose more than 4% on news of the military operation on news that Russia was launching a military attack in Ukraine.

U.S. crude futures jumped by 4.73% to trade at $96.46 per barrel, CNBC reported.

Brent crude futures were up 4.69% at $101.93 per barrel, crossing the $100 level for the first time since 2014.

Natural gas prices jumped 4.7%. Spot gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, rose 1.82% and last traded at $1,942.26.

Explosions were heard in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv, NBC News reported.

The United Nations Security Council met in New York late Wednesday as representatives from member states pleaded with Putin not to attack Ukraine.

Putin warned other countries that there would be “consequences they have never seen,” if there’s an attempt to interfere with Russia’s action, Reuters reported.

Goldman Sachs said in a Wednesday report that the impact on energy prices should be limited. “While Europe imports a large share of its natural gas consumption from Russia, the US is a net exporter of natural gas and any spillover effects on US gas prices should be modest, analysts at the Wall Street bank said.

“Our commodities strategists also expect only a modest impact on oil prices, though they see the risks as skewed to the upside because the oil market is already tight.”

Russian prePutin declared a “special military operation” in Ukraine, and Kyiv has confirmed the start of hostilities in a devastating new chapter for Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday morning local time that he is launching a “special military operation” in Ukraine, a move that was followed up by reports of explosions around cities, including Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, and the capital, Kyiv, vox.com reported.

The Ukrainian foreign minister also confirmed that “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strike.”

Putin’s attempt to redraw the map of Europe could lead into the most devastating conflict on the continent since World War II. It could cost thousands of civilians lives and create hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in Ukraine.

Putin’s declaration came while the United Nations Security Council held a special session in New York on the Ukraine crisis, and bombing began shortly thereafter, according to multiple news reports. In his address, Putin claimed “to defend people who for eight years are suffering persecution and genocide by the Kyiv regime,” a reference to a false claim about the government in Ukraine. Putin claimed that the Russian military seeks “demilitarization and denazification” but not occupation. He demanded Ukraine lay down its weapons or be “responsible for bloodshed.”

Exactly what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine is hard to know. And the world may not fully understand what is happening on the ground as it’s unfolding. Russia has already used misinformation tactics and will likely jam up local communications. But it’s hard to interpret what Putin said as anything other than a declaration of war, according to Vox.com

The tension over Ukraine has been building for months, but escalated quickly this week, when, on Monday, Putin delivered an hour-long and combative speech that essentially denied Ukrainian statehood. He recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine where Moscow has backed separatists since 2014, and sent in so-called peacekeeping forces into the region. As experts said, this was likely beginning, not the end, and the stage for a much larger conflict.

Putin’s escalation comes after the United States warned, again and again, that a larger invasion by Putin was imminent, and after the US and its European allies imposed significant — but far from all-encompassing — sanctions on Moscow.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” President Joe Biden said in a statement following Putin’s announcement. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

But Ukraine — and the world — is right now in a perilous and unpredictable moment. moment. Hours before Putin’s announcement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an impassioned speech against war, one directed to Russian audience, as a final plea: “War takes away guarantees for everyone,” he said. “No one will have any kind of guarantees of security. And who will suffer from that the most? People.”

Over the last few months, Putin had amassed close to 190,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, a force that military analysts said was clearly prepared and ready to launch an invasion.

Ukraine is also a larger stage for Russia to try to reassert its influence in Europe and the world, and for Putin to cement his legacy, and reclaim a semblance of the Russian empire that was lost after the fall of the Soviet Union following the end of the Cold War.

Last year, Russia presented the US with a list of demands, some of which were nonstarters for the United States and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin demanded that NATO stop its eastward expansion and deny membership to Ukraine, and also made other demands for “security guarantees” around NATO.

Ukraine is the fourth largest recipient of military funding from the US, and the intelligence cooperation between the two countries has deepened in response to threats from Russia. But Ukraine’s NATO membership is not at all an imminent possibility. Still, Moscow’s demand was largely seen as a non-starter by the West, as NATO’s open-door policy says sovereign countries can choose their own security alliances.

Though Putin has continued to tout the threat of NATO, his speech on Monday revealed that this is much more than that. He does not see the government in Ukraine as legitimate: “Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,” Putin said.

As experts said, it is difficult to square that speech with any sort of realistic diplomatic outcome to seriously avert conflict — for Putin, regime change in Ukraine appeared to be the underlying goal. Putin’s speech Monday was essentially a confession that this wasn’t really about NATO, said Dan Baer, the acting director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) from 2013 to 2017. “It was about that he doesn’t think Ukraine has a right to exist as a free country,” he said before Putin’s escalation Wednesday night.

What we know so far

Whatever Putin has unleashed is still unfolding. The Ukrainian interior minister has told CNN that the “invasion has begun.” There are reports of explosions around major cities, something Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed.

Reuters also reported Russian troops landing in two Ukrainian cities, Mariupol and Odessa, and a Ukrainian official confirmed to MSNBC that troops were in at least one of them.

But the start of wars are messy and chaotic and confusing, often deliberately so, and so there is not a lot that we know right now, and we may not know for some time.

The United States has said it will not involve troops in any Ukrainian conflict, though the US has added troops to NATO’s eastern flank. That leaves sanctions as the main tool against Russia, and the US and its European allies are likely to place another round of much tougher sanctions on Russia following a first round of penalties that did little to deter Moscow.

Zelensky convened a security council meeting in the early hours of Thursday to impose martial law, according to multiple news reports.

What this all means for Ukraine, for Europe, for all the world is still really unclear. The Biden administration has warned that a war in Ukraine could kill as many as 50,000 civilians, and spark a refugee crisis that forces between one and five million to flee. This comes with a cost for Russia too, as it could face thousands of casualties. A pathway to out of this crisis does not appear to exist right now, and to get there may mean incalculable and unpredictable costs for Ukraine, and for Russia.","Oil prices rose more than 4% on news of the military operation on news that Russia was launching a military attack in Ukraine.

National Library To Embark On Indigenous Language Campaign,"Chief executive officer (CEO) of the National Library of Nigeria (NLN), Professor Chinwe Anunuobi has said the apex library in the country will embark on the collation and documentation of Nigerian families ancestry in indigenous languages as a means of preserving indigenous mother tongues.

The national librarian made this known at the conference on the “Use of Technology for Multilingual Learning: Challenges and Opportunities,” organized by the apex library to mark UN International Mother Language Day celebrated annually on February 21.

Lamenting the state of indigenous languages in Nigeria, Anunobi noted that only 3,000 texts in indigenous languages are available in the entire repository of the national library, noting that both the library and the Nigerian people are doing a poor job in preserving indigenous languages.

She, however noted that all hope was not lost as Nigeria can learn how best to preserve and digitalize her indigenous languages from countries as Bangladesh, and Bulgaria.

To collate Nigerian families ancestry in the major indigenous languages of Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba, the national library will deploy its national Reading Promotion Campaign, RPC, but this time to reach the hard to reach areas documenting popular personalities, events and edifices in the various communities. The library will also work with researchers and scholars to document ancestral histories.

“I know that so many families, institutions, cultures and socio-political and sociocultural issues have gone past us without remembrance. I sat down to look at some edifice and some prominent people in Nigeria, and even those who may not be deemed prominent nationwide, but in their localities and communities they are very strong and powerful people. However, there is no one to tell their stories, or to tell what they have contributed to their communities and to the nation. Hence, the decision to start the family book club.

“This is a tall order but we have to start somewhere. I believe in the next twenty years, we will be able to tell a great grandchild of, say Sanusi Dantata, ‘your daddy was a great man,’ and be able to trace his family history and achievements.

“We will do sensitization to tell them what we have to do, and collaborate with them, with the aid of the traditional rulers,” she said.

Bulgarian Ambassador to Nigeria, Yanko Yordanov noted that the national library is collaborating with the Bulgarian National Library in developing meaningful partnerships between Nigeria and Bugarian libraries.

“The National Director of the Bulgarian Library is exchanging experience and good practices f what we do in this field with Nigeria. They are two great ladies contributing much to bringing closer our two nations in terms of culture and knowledge.”

Responding to the apex library’s quest for the preservation of indigenous languages, Director American Center, US Embassy in Nigeria, Aondoana Orlu, advised that the languages be preserved in its purest form, both sound and written form, via digitacuration for authenticity’s sake.

"ICSS ’95 Set Holds 5th Reunion, Donates Sandals, Uniform To Students","Old students of the Itire Community Secondary School in Surulere, Lagos State, have donated uniforms and sandals to over 100 students of the school as part of activities to mark their 5th reunion.

They also held a career talk for the senior students to sensitise them on the need to shun divisive tendencies and face their studies.

The 1995 Set led by assistant coordinator, Joke Abass, said the items were donated as part of give-back to their alma mater where the foundation of their careers and businesses were formed, adding that it was the fifth anniversary of their reunion.

She disclosed that the items were donated by the members of the 1995 Set scattered across the world even as she explained it was not the first time as they had donated books, chairs, desks, and free coaching in the past.

One of them, Dr Lukman Ajijola, a senior lecturer at the University of Lagos, told the students to jettison claims that western education is a scam and a mere waste of time, even as he reiterated that good behaviour and education helped to shape him and his school mates.

He said, “shun ritualism and all that talk that school is a scam, no it is not. Your foundation today will determine how far your roots tomorrow. Hardwork does not kill, study hard and tomorrow you will stand to address younger people. Please shun crime and get-rich-quick syndrome, obey your teachers and your parents, and don’t bully other students.”

Another alumnus, Friday Chigbu, an Accountant by profession, told the students that everything he learnt from the school helped to shape him into a responsible member of the society, even as he appealed to them to shun criminal vices and bullying.

The Principals of the Junior and Senior sections of the school commended the old students for reaching out to their alma mater, promising that the staff and management will continue to uphold the tenets of good education.

The gathering brought the ex-students of the 1995 Set from different parts of the country and the Alumni, thereafter, retired to a party where they shared life lessons.","Old students of the Itire Community Secondary School in Surulere, Lagos State, have donated uniforms and sandals to over 100 students of the school as part of activities to mark their 5th reunion.

"2023 Presidency: Group Endorses Yerima, Says He’s Best For Nigeria","Ahead of the 2023 general election, the youth and women wings of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), have endorsed a former governor of Zamfara State, Senator Ahmed Sani Yerima, for the office of president, stating that he is the best choice for Nigeria come 2023.

The President of Youth Wing of CAN and the national director, Christian Strategies, Simon Doliy, made this known during Yarima’s meeting and consultation with the Women Wing of CAN (WOWICAN) in Abuja.

Donliy said: “Yarima knows the importance of women and youths, that is why he started the consultation with the women group and our youth group.

“He’s a Muslim and now he has started with the Christians for the 19 northern states and Abuja. So, the essence is for them to know him, how to know his vision as an aspirant for the president of Nigeria come 2023.

“Everyone has their own aspirations. I feel that he is the best for the nation this time around because of his long-time experience during his stints as governor and as a Senator, he has all the experiences.”

For her part, the chairperson of the Women Wing of Christian Association of Nigeria, Mrs Elizabeth Ajegena, stated that the former Zamfara State governor has a positive track record and if given the chance to lead the country as president, he would ensure that peace prevails in Nigeria.

She said: “We’re here today to the glory of God, for our son Ahmad Sani Yarima, that had been the Governor of Zamfara State. For this, we have had testimony of goodwill about him.

“He is a man of peace, a man of integrity, he’s a man that accommodates, a man that tolerates. Because of these, he motivated us to come and share with him since he has come out that he wants to become the next president of Nigeria.

“We pray that as he did it in Zamfara State, may the will of God be done and he will continue with that.”

Meanwhile, the WOWICAN Deaconess, Mrs. Victoria Bola Ihesiulor, expressed confidence in the person of Senator Yarima, noting that by this consultation, he has shown that he was ready to work with everyone and he belongs to the class of people whom religious or sectional divide do not influence his decision.

“Yarima is a man of peace, tranquility and he is someone who believes in the oneness of Nigeria, you can see from the attendance today, women of the Christian background from all the northern states are consulting with him in order to have a proper decision on who to vote for come 2023,” she said.

Prayers were said for the country and also in his response, Senator Ahmad Sani Yarima expressed satisfaction and assured the groups of his capacity to unite and bring peace to the country.

“If I become the president of this country, I will ensure we work with you to ensure unity and progress of this country, you will find in me a good leader who will be fair and just to everyone in this country,” Yarima stated.","Ahead of the 2023 general election, the youth and women wings of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), have endorsed a former governor of Zamfara State, Senator Ahmed Sani Yerima, for the office of president, stating that he is the best choice for Nigeria come 2023.

Hope Of Igbo Presidency Dims Over Killings In South East,"The hope of the South East region producing the next president in 2023 could be thwarted as the insecurity caused by the activities of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the paramilitary wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra separatist movement, continues in the region.

Security sources who spoke with LEADERSHIP said the gruesome activities in ESN camps are enormous and there is urgent need to tackle this menace.

Just last week, gunmen suspected to be members of ESN killed eight traders in Abia market at New Cattle market in Omuma-Uzo in Ukwa West local government area of Abia State.

Abia State commissioner for information, Eze Chikamnayo, who confirmed the incident, said gunmen attacked traders at the cattle market on February 15, at about 11:35pm.

The commissioner said the government responded swiftly by mobilising security agencies to the scene to secure the lives and property of the traders and fish out the assailants.

Speaking on attacks like this, the source said this is unsettling the security apparatuses in the country and causing tensions in other regions.

The source, however, said there are already plans underground to ensure that the South East does not produce the next president as there are fears of escalation of ESN activities if someone from the region becomes president.

To salvage the situation, the source said leaders from the region must come out and condemn the alleged criminal activities of ESN and IPOB.

Former Senate president and secretary to the government of the federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, is one of the prominent persons from the southeast contesting the presidency in 2023. Our source claimed that he may have fallen out with his major supporter, the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, but Anyim is still going on with his ambition.

ADVERTISEMENT

Though there are some cases of alleged corruption against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Anyim is still a prominent voice in southeast hoping to be president come 2023.

The Coalition of Northern Groups in Nigeria (CNG) and the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) have condemned the gruesome murder of the traders.

CNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the state government must act quickly to bring the culprits to book even as he warned that the North would no longer tolerate unwarranted attacks on its people living as minorities in the South East or any other part of the country.

“We have studied the unfolding events carefully and with considerable restraint and maturity to the point of condoning and accommodating several unreasonable and unacceptable actions that have been perpetrated against northerners in the South East in particular.

“The recent attack in Abia has taken matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option in the face of unprovoked evictions, attacks and killings of northerners in various parts of the South East,” he said.

On his part, the national president of the AYCF, Yerima Shettima, said the group was deeply concerned about the killing of the traders doing their legitimate businesses.

ADVERTISEMENT

While condemning the attack, he welcomed the prompt response of security agencies and urged the state government to pursue its promise to bring the killers to book, in the spirit of national unity and stability.

He said: “The AYCF will be closely following the efforts of the Abia State government to fulfill its promise of providing compensation for the families and survivors of the attack. We pray this should be the last bad news we would hear about innocent northern traders, from not just Abia but the entire South East, in the spirit of national unity and stability.”

Meanwhile, the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, had commended security agencies for arresting about 30 suspected kidnappers who he described as ‘cannibals.

Ongoing insecurity in the S/E Not Enough To Deny It Presidency, Says Ohanaeze

However, the apex Igbo social-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday insisted that the current insecurity in the South East was not enough to deny the zone the presidency in 2023.

Spokesman of Ohanaeze, Alex Ogbonnia disclosed this in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Enugu.

Ogbonnia insisted that what was happening in the Northern part of Nigeria before Nigerians decided to concede the presidency to President Muhammadu Buhari cannot be compared with what is happening in the South East now.

He further pointed out that by the time Nigerians conceded presidency to the South West, they were in agitation over the issue of the late Abiola’s presidency and that the presidency was yielded to them as part of ways to compensate them over the issue.

Ogbonnia further stated that there was serious youth restiveness in the South South when Nigerians conceded the vice president to the zone.

He therefore insisted that over 99 percent of people of the South East are agitating for president of South East extraction, adding the less than one percent making negative impact cannot nullify the interest of the majority

Tasks Ahead Of 2023 Elections Challenging – INEC

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has described the task ahead of 2023 and other off-cycle elections in the country as challenging.

This is even as the nation’s electoral body noted that it will continue to raise the bar of credible elections in Nigeria. INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, said this during a meeting to welcome six new national commissioners and to swear in a resident electoral commissioner in Abuja yesterday.

He, however, urged them to quickly settle in and familiarise themselves with the rules, procedures, and responsibilities of their offices.

Yakubu also urged them to uphold the tenets of integrity, rule of law, and service to the nation in the discharge of their duties.

“Our success in this arduous task draws largely from our integrity as election managers. We must be strict in the application of the law, firm in handling the public trust bestowed on us, and fair in our dealings with political parties, candidates and other stakeholders and all Nigerians,” he told the new members of the election management body.

Shortly after administering the oath of office on the new national commissioner, Olaniyi Babalola Ijalaye, a legal practitioner from Ondo State, the INEC chairman deployed him to Ogun State as the new resident electoral commissioner (REC).

He said, “The current REC for Ogun State, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, is redeployed to Lagos State where a vacuum was created with the appointment of Mr Sam Olumekun, the immediate past REC of the state as one of the new national commissioners.”

The other newly sworn-in members of the Commission are Mrs May Agbamuche-Mbu, Malam Mohammed Haruna, Mr Kenneth Nnamdi Ukeagu, Prof. Rhoda Gumus, and Maj. Gen. Modibbo Abubakar Alkalu (retd.)

Yakubu noted that four of them were not new to the Commission.

He said “Agbamuche-Mbu, a lawyer, and Malam Mohammed Haruna, a journalist, have been re-appointed to serve for a second term.

“Olumekun, a retired civil servant, has served for two terms as Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in many states, including Lagos, while Mr Kenneth Nnamdi Ukeagu has been a career staff of the Commission, rising to the rank of director.

“The other two national commissioners are Gumus, a professor of Engineering, and Alkali, a retired major general of the Nigerian Army.”

The INEC boss said that the newly appointed and reappointed officials bring to the Commission their cumulative experiences in diverse fields that will no doubt strengthen the work of the Commission for the reform of the electoral process and the conduct of free, fair, and credible elections.

With the current appointment, he said the Commission now has the full complement of 12 national commissioners.

“In discharging our enormous responsibilities, we must abide by our oaths of office. We must continue to defend the choice made by Nigerians at the polls by protecting the sanctity of the vote without which the value of democratic election is diminished,” he added.

Electoral Bill Will Be Signed In Days, Not Weeks – Adesina

Meanwhile, the special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media, Femi Adesina, has stated that the President will assent to the electoral Bill in a matter of days.

Adesina stated this at the 21st Century Chronicle Roundtable with the theme “Going for Broke: Fighting Insecurity in Nigeria.”

He cautioned politicians against heating up the polity and pointe out that people had commenced campaigns against the laid-down rules, even as he remarked that election in Nigeria is a natural tension generator.

He called for sanctions on those breaching the law by campaigning.

“Campaign had already started against the laid-down rules; it started as early as the second term of the president began. Today it is now worse as people are crisscrossing the country. I think those jumping the gun should be penalized.

“It is very important we should follow the rules; when INEC says we should start campaigns we should. It pays nobody to generate tension. Like I said, the electoral bill would be signed in a matter of hours. It could be days but certainly not weeks.

The 2023 election would show if we are improving or have not learnt anything,” he added.","Abia State commissioner for information, Eze Chikamnayo, who confirmed the incident, said gunmen attacked traders at the cattle market on February 15, at about 11:35pm.

Russia’s Putin Announces ‘Military Operation’ In Ukraine,"On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military action in Ukraine, followed by explosions heard across the country, sparking fury from Joe Biden, who warned of “catastrophic loss of life.”

Weeks of intense diplomacy and the imposition of Western sanctions failed to deter Putin, who had massed between 150,000 and 200,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine.

“I have made the decision of a military operation,” Putin said in a surprise television announcement shortly before 6:00am (0300 GMT) in Moscow.

He also called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms, claiming he wanted a “demilitarisation” of the former Soviet state but not its occupation.

An AFP reporter in Kyiv heard explosions within about 30 minutes of Putin’s announcement. Explosions were also heard in the eastern city of Mariupol, according to AFP.

US President Biden announced he would address the nation Thursday on “consequences” for Russia and said the world would “hold Russia accountable” for its actions.

He said a Russian attack would cause “catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”.

Putin’s announcement statement came after the Kremlin said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.

In response, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional late-night appeal to Russians not to support a “major war in Europe”.

Speaking Russian, Zelensky said that the people of Russia are being lied to about Ukraine and that the possibility of war also “depends on you”.

“Who can stop (the war)? People. These people are among you, I am sure,” he said.

Zelensky said he had tried to call Putin but there was “no answer, only silence”, adding that Moscow now had around 200,000 soldiers near Ukraine’s borders.

Earlier on Wednesday the separatist leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk sent separate letters to Putin, asking him to “help them repel Ukraine’s aggression”, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The two letters were published by Russian state media and were both dated February 22.

Their appeals came after Putin recognised their independence and signed friendship treaties with them that include defence deals.

– ‘Moment of peril’ –

Putin has defied a barrage of international criticism over the crisis, with some Western leaders saying he was no longer rational.

His announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.

The 27-nation bloc had also imposed sanctions on Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu and high-ranking figures including the commanders of Russia’s army, navy and air force, another part of the wave of Western punishment after Putin sought to rewrite Ukraine’s borders.

The United Nations Security Council met late Wednesday for its second emergency session in three days over the crisis, with a personal plea there by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Putin going unheeded.

“President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,” Guterres said.

The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that an all-out Russian invasion could displace five million people, triggering a new European refugee crisis.

Before Putin’s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.

“We are united in believing that the future of European security is being decided right now, here in our home, in Ukraine,” President Zelensky said during a joint media appearance with the visiting leaders of Poland and Lithuania.

Western capitals said Russia had amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine’s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea and on warships in the Black Sea.

Ukraine has around 200,000 military personnel and Wednesday’s call up could see up to 250,000 reservists aged between 18 and 60 receive their mobilisation papers.

Moscow’s total forces are much larger — around a million active-duty personnel — and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.

– High cost of war –

But Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.

Shelling had intensified in recent days between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists — a Ukrainian soldier was killed on Wednesday, the sixth in four days — and civilians living near the front were fearful.

Dmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised the two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.

“She said: ‘Have you heard the news?’. How could I have known? There’s no electricity, never mind internet. I don’t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I’m afraid,” he said.

In a Russian village around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the border, AFP reporters saw military equipment including rocket launchers, howitzers and fuel tanks mounted on trains stretching for hundreds of metres.

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.

Speaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.

Washington Wednesday announced sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Germany had earlier effectively suspended by halting certification.

Australia, Britain, Japan and the European Union have all also announced sanctions.","“I have made the decision of a military operation,” Putin said in a surprise television announcement shortly before 6:00am (0300 GMT) in Moscow.

"Strike Continues, ASUU Insists As Ngige Pleads With Union","Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, President of ASUU, and Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment

Dr. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has urged the Academic Staff Union of Universities to end its four-week strike before the deadline.

It was reported that Ngige had met with the leadership of ASUU during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday.

During the meeting which lasted for several hours, the minister accused ASUU of claiming that the government had failed to implement some long standing agreements.

Ngige in an interview told one of our correspondents that ASUU demands were being reviewed, saying he would meet with ASUU and the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council next week.

He said, “We have discussed quite a number of things and I am urging them to brief their members and call off the strike before the expiration of the one-month duration of the warning strike. By Monday, we would have dealt with some of the issues they are talking about and return to them for further discussion. We will meet again with them and the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council and we will take it from there.”

Meet all our demands first, ASUU replies FG

However, the national president of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke in an interview with The PUNCH insisted that the union would not call off its strike if all its demands were not met.

Osodeke said, “We can call off the strike tomorrow if the FG implements and meets all our demands. It is in their hands to meet all the demands not in our hands. If they want it called off this week, next week, it is possible if they should do what they are supposed to do and not all these empty promises that we are not sure they will not implement. But If you call off the strike, as usual, they will abandon everything.”

But Ngige cautioned the union not to intimidate the committee and Ministry of Education, saying if they did, their document would not fly.

“We had a committee we impanelled in the ministry of education to take matters up because they are the direct employers of the lecturers. The committee was headed by Professor Manzali and there was a draft proposal which the education ministry has to agree on with them and then break it up to the higher bodies of the government, the Presidential Committee on Salaries, and from there, it goes to FEC for approval.

“ASUU should not intimidate the education ministry or the committee to come up with things that are not in tandem with the normal rate. if they do that, the document will not fly. The ministry of education will resuscitate that committee within two weeks to look at the draft proposal it had with ASUU so that they can come up with something for the PSC to have a look at and send to FEC”.

Osodeke replied that all the union wanted was for the FG to implement the agreements.

“We have no problem and we are busy people he might have all the time, our own is for them to implement.

“If our union could negotiate during the military era and had agreements signed but in the civilian era they are telling us what to do and what not to do, that means something is wrong with this system. What they are doing now is to be blackmailing us and intimidating us.

“We are just waiting they have said this over and over. If they are serious let them implement all that we have agreed on. We can call off tomorrow if they implement. Nigerians should tell them to implement the agreement, we don’t gamble.” ,,","Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, President of ASUU, and Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and EmploymentDr. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has urged the Academic Staff Union of Universities to end its four-week strike before the deadline.

"Zamfara: Hours after panel report, Sen. Nasiha sworn in as deputy governor","Few hours after receiving the report on the activities of the embattled Zamfara state Deputy Governor Mahadi Aliyu Gusau and his consequent impeachment by the state legislature Wednesday, a serving lawmaker, Senator Hassan Mohammed Nasiha was sworn in as his replacement.

The impeached deputy governor is the son of General Mohammed Gusau (retd), a powerful military operative and influential Nigerian otherwise known as Mr Spy.

Nasiha, was until now, the lawmaker representing Zamfara Central at the National Assembly.

The report

The investigating panel submitted the report to the House of Assembly and read on the floor by Speaker of the House Rt Hon Nasiru Mu’azu Magarya.

Magarya told the plenary that the committee set up to investigate the former deputy governor found him guilty of all the charges levelled against him, and directed his colleagues to proceed with individual voting of affirmation for the deputy governor to be impeached as required by the law.

There and then, the House Clerk, Shehu Saidu Anka constituted a voting panel where each and every member was being called in alphabetical order of their constituencies to affirm his vote.

At the end of the exercise, twenty (20) out of twenty members (22) voted in favour of the impeachment while the only Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member of the House Hon Salihu Usman Zurmi was conspicuously absent during today’s plenary.

Having secured the required number of the votes as directed by the constitution, Speaker Magarya announced the impeachment of Gusau from office.

“By virtue of section 1999, the members hereby affirmed the nomination of Sen. Hassan Mohammed Gusau as the new Deputy Governor,” the Speaker declared.

At this point, the House adjourned plenary for one hour to pass the resolution to the executive and also expected a communication for the nomination of the new deputy governor from the executive for screening and confirmation by the legislature in accordance with the law.

Subsequently, Nasiha was screened by the lawmakers and confirmed as the substantive deputy governor.

Inauguration

Inaugurating the new deputy governor, Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle charged him to support his administration in the development of the state.

Matawalle, who assured of a cordial working relationship with the deputy governor, also urged the former lawmaker to come up with initiatives to address the lingering insecurity bedevilling the state.

“I will work closely with you to find out modalities on addressing the insecurity situation for peace to thrive,” Matawalle stated.

He said the choice of Nasiha was an outcome of series of consultations and also based on his dedication to the development of the state at the National Assembly.

Governor Matawalle commended the state lawmakers for their steadfastness and for staying by the Constitution they swore to uphold.

Matawalle further charged the deputy governor to ensure unity among people of the state and create open door policy to all, regardless of their political inclinations for the development of the state.

In his acceptance speech, Deputy Governor Nasiha promised to work harmoniously with the office of the governor for the unity and progress of the state.

Rift over defection

Gusau’s travails started following his refusal to join Governor Matawalle who, sometime last year, defected from the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).

The duo assumed office on the platform of the PDP following the Supreme Court judgement which disqualified the candidates of the APC earlier declared winners in the 2019 elections.

The House had served the deputy governor the impeachment notice through the Secretary to the State Government before asking the Chief Judge to constitute an investigative panel to verify the allegations against him.

Offences

The House, through its Chairman, House Standing Committee, Shamsudeen Basko, said the deputy governor was accused of three offences.

These are “abuse of office, criminal self-enrichment using public funds and failure to discharge official duties.”

Mr Basko said: “Abuse of office. This includes Constitutional breach of sections 190 and 193 (1), (2) (a) (b)(c), of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).

“Criminal self-enrichment using public funds; includes criminal diversion of state funds, conspiracy to defraud the state and approval of dubious retirement in his office.

“Failure to discharge constitutional duties, which give rise to insubordination,” he added.","The impeached deputy governor is the son of General Mohammed Gusau (retd), a powerful military operative and influential Nigerian otherwise known as Mr Spy.

Putin’s Russia Invades Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday with explosions heard soon after across the country and its foreign minister warning a “full-scale invasion” was underway.

Weeks of intense diplomacy and the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia failed to deter Putin, who had massed between 150,000 and 200,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine.

“I have made the decision of a military operation,” Putin said in a surprise television announcement that triggered immediate condemnation from US President Joe Biden and sent global financial markets into turmoil.

Shortly after the announcement, explosions were heard in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and several other cities, according to AFP correspondents.

Putin called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and justified the operation by claiming the government was overseeing a “genocide” in the east of the country.

The Kremlin had earlier said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.

The extent of Thursday’s attacks was not immediately clear, but Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the worst-case scenario was playing out.

“Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,” Kuleba tweeted.

“This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

Biden Says ‘World Will Hold Russia Accountable’ Over Ukraine Attack

Ukrainians Wake Up To Sounds Of bombings As War Hits Home

Biden immediately warned of “consequences” for Russia and that there would be a “catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”.

NATO’s chief condemned Russia’s “reckless and unprovoked attack” on Ukraine.

Putin’s move came after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional appeal late on Wednesday night to Russians not to support a “major war in Europe”.

Speaking Russian, Zelensky said that the people of Russia were being lied to about Ukraine.

Zelensky said he had tried to call Putin but there was “no answer, only silence”, adding that Moscow now had around 200,000 soldiers near Ukraine’s borders.

Earlier on Wednesday the separatist leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk sent separate letters to Putin, asking him to “help them repel Ukraine’s aggression”, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The two letters were published by Russian state media and were both dated February 22.

Their appeals came after Putin recognised their independence and signed friendship treaties with them that include defence deals.

– ‘Moment of peril’ –

Putin had for weeks defied a barrage of international criticism over the crisis, with some Western leaders saying he was no longer rational.

His announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.

The 27-nation bloc had also imposed sanctions on Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu and high-ranking figures including the commanders of Russia’s army, navy and air force, another part of the wave of Western punishment after Putin sought to rewrite Ukraine’s borders.

The United Nations Security Council met late Wednesday for its second emergency session in three days over the crisis, with a personal plea there by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Putin going unheeded.

“President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,” Guterres said.

The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that an all-out Russian invasion could displace five million people, triggering a new European refugee crisis.

Before Putin’s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.

“We are united in believing that the future of European security is being decided right now, here in our home, in Ukraine,” President Zelensky said during a joint media appearance with the visiting leaders of Poland and Lithuania.

Western capitals said Russia had amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine’s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea and on warships in the Black Sea.

Ukraine has around 200,000 military personnel, and could call up to 250,000 reservists.

Moscow’s total forces are much larger — around a million active-duty personnel — and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.

– High cost of war –

But Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.

Shelling had intensified in recent days between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists — a Ukrainian soldier was killed on Wednesday, the sixth in four days — and civilians living near the front were fearful.

Dmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised the two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.

“She said: ‘Have you heard the news?’. How could I have known? There’s no electricity, never mind internet. I don’t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I’m afraid,” he said.

In a Russian village around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the border, AFP reporters saw military equipment including rocket launchers, howitzers and fuel tanks mounted on trains stretching for hundreds of metres.

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.

Speaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.

Washington Wednesday announced sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Germany had earlier effectively suspended by halting certification.

Australia, Britain, Japan and the European Union have all also announced sanctions.","The Kremlin had earlier said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.

He is further praying the court for, “a declaration that arrest and continued detention of the Applicant by the Agent of the Respondent without bringing him before a court of competent jurisdiction from 12th of February 2022 till date, is Illegal, unlawful and a gross violation of Applicant’s fundamental right to personal liberty and freedom of movement guaranteed by Section 35(1) of the I999 Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and Article 6 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act.

As well as, “an order of this Honourable Court restraining the Respondent’s agents, servants proxies, police or anyone acting on their behalf from further harassing, detaining, intimidating, arresting the Applicant unlawfully”.

Besides, he prayed the court to order his release on bail to enable him to take care of his deteriorating health condition.

Kyari told the court that he is suffering from “diabetes; high blood pressure and severe heart disease that may cause death”.

“That the Applicant was receiving medical treatment on daily basis due to the seriousness of the illness.

“That since 12th of February, 2022, the Applicant has not accessed any medical treatment, which is very dangerous to his health.

“That failure of the Applicant to check his heart, high blood pressure will result in severe health problems or may even lead to heart failure and death. The medical report from National Hospital is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit A.

Russian Military Vehicles Cross into Ukraine from Annexed Crimea,"Security camera footage on Thursday shows a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Russian-annexed Crimea.

Russian troops launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen.”

Big explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an invasion that could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent.

Ukrainians started fleeing some cities, and the Russian military claimed to have incapacitated all of Ukraine’s air defenses and air bases within hours.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine’s military infrastructure. Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault, while never knowing precisely when it would come, were urged to stay home and not to panic even as the country’s border guard agency reported an artillery barrage by Russian troops from neighboring Belarus.

President Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy.

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to “demilitarize” it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Biden in a written statement condemned the “unprovoked and unjustified attack,” and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would “hold Russia accountable.” The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a “full-scale invasion” and said Ukraine will “defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.

“We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?” 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin “will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.”

The Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that “there is no threat to civilian population.”

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

After the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets. Then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to start in relative calm.

The consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.

Asian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, “whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.”

Putin urged Ukrainian servicemen to “immediately put down arms and go home.”

In a stark reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin warned that “no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.” He emphasized that Russia is “one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.”

Though the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.

Putin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian “aggression,” an announcement that the White House said was a “false flag” operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.

Putin’s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow’s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. “But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.”

Zelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin’s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to “maintain peace” in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that “this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.”

“Any provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,” he said.

He challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that “you are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.”

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin’s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: “Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”

NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning “Russia’s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.”

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.

“In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,” they said on Twitter.

Even before Putin’s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that “Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.”

The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine’s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.","Security camera footage on Thursday shows a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Russian-annexed Crimea.

"Nigeria Airline Operators Deny Fixing Base Fare, Lament Loss of $60m to Bird Strikes, Flight Cancellations","The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has denied fixing base fare for economy flight tickets at N50, 000 as travellers insisted that the sudden increase in fares suggested collusion by the association.

The operators also complained that in 2021, they lost $60 million (N24 billon) to bird strike alone. The amount was used to replace their aircraft engines destroyed by bird strike.

In addition, they said cancelled flights due to lack of lack of night landing facilities at some airports, known as sunset airports, cost them over N20 billion in 2021.

However, indications showed that air travellers have started shunning the airports as airlines have been recording low passenger traffic due to high fares.

Speaking during a media conference, in Lagos, on Wednesday, the Vice President of AON and Chairman/CEO of Air Peace, Allen Onyema said the N50, 000 ticket price had always been in the airlines’ systems in the last five years, adding that airlines only adjust ticket cost based on their operational costs.

Onyema said what the airlines did was to work out unit cost per seat, which he said determined their basic ticket price.

Onyema who was representing the President of AON, pointed out that cost of aviation fuel was increased by over 200 per cent, with over 100 per cent depreciation in exchange rate in the last two years, while ground handling companies had increased their rates by over 300 per cent, yet cost of air ticket remained below $100.

“People have asked us how we maintain our planes with the fares we charge. In as much as we are rendering services, our business must be sustained. The repair of just one aircraft engine can take everything an airline makes in one month. Airline business is not a profitable business,” Onyema added.

He said that no airline loves to delay flights but factors beyond the airlines’ control cause flight delays.

Some of the causes of flight delays he mentioned included bird strikes, airport apron congestion, lack of space for check-in of passengers, poor airport infrastructure, air traffic flow control, bad weather and unruly behavior of passengers.

Onyema said that bird strike incidents in Nigeria was on the increase despite efforts by the Federal Airports of Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to stem it, thus forcing airlines to ground aircraft that should be operating and losing huge revenue.

He, therefore, called on the concerned authorities to provide airport equipment to help reduce bird strikes in Nigeria.

The AON said it strongly objected to the multiple designation granted foreign carriers such as Qatar Airways and Ethiopian Airlines by the federal government.

“Designating foreign airlines to multiple airports in Nigeria impede growth of domestic airlines and the aviation sector. All foreign airlines put together do not provide 10 per cent of jobs provided by the smallest airline in Nigeria.

“Multiple designation granted foreign airlines would lead to job losses and domestic airlines closing shops,” Onyema added.

Meanwhile, THISDAY investigations have confirmed low turnout of passengers at the airports since Monday, following the hike in airfares to N50, 000.

This meant that one way tickets would cost over N50, 000 and might increase to N80, 000 to N90, 000 per ticket.

This was confirmed by some protocol personnel who spoke to THISDAY at the domestic wing of the Lagos airport.

They revealed that the increase in fares have reduced passenger traffic at the airport.

“You have to know that the minimum ticket you can buy now is N50, 000. In the last two days I have sold tickets as high as N85, 000; some N75, 000 and some N70, 000. But the traffic is dropping fast. I am sure that if passenger traffic continues to drop, airlines will be forced to bring down their fares,” the source who pleased to remain anonymous said.

THISDAY spoke to a passenger who travelled from Abuja to Lagos, on Wednesday, who disclosed that many of the seats in the aircraft that brought him to Lagos were empty.

“I was surprised at that time of the day, first flight from Abuja there was so many empty seats. The airlines have to understand that there is no money in this country. It is the middle class that flies. If they shun air travel the money bags cannot sustain their operations,” he said.

A spokesman of one of the major airlines confirmed to THISDAY that passenger traffic has dropped and he was worried that it would drop further.

"Shell, Total Energies Advocate Incentives to Boost Investments in Nigeria’s Gas Sector, Seek Review of Petroleum Act","Multinational oil and gas companies, Shell and Total Energies, have stressed the need for the Nigerian government to provide some incentives to attract more investors into the nation’s gas sector.

The international oil companies (IOCs) specifically called for an amendment in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to provide more clarity and better fiscal terms for Deepwater gas investments, insisting that more clarity on gas marketing terms would help to attract more investors into the gas space.

The Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Alboni and the Deputy Managing Director, Total Energies Deepwater, Mr. Victor Bandele, jointly opined that such incentives were needed now that the country is moving aggressively towards gas, having chosen gas as Nigeria’s transition fuel.

They spoke at a panel at the ongoing sixth edition of Sub-Saharan African Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (SAIPEC 2022) with the theme: “Fostering Collaboration to Create Cross Border Partnerships across the Oil, Gas and Energy Spectrum”.

The topic of the panel session was: “IOCs: Dynamics of Sub-Saharan Africa’s Energy, Oil, Gas Industry, as We Strive to Low Carbon Future.”

Responding to a question on how the PIA would impact investment in low carbon economy in Nigeria, Bandele said, “So, there is a drive for gas. We are still asking for the terms of the gas, the terms for the marketing part of the gas, to be such that it would be extremely attractive for the investors.

“But when you look at the Act itself, it has brought a lot of clarity to the fiscal terms. So, all the investors can now come in and look at the terms and decide whether it is comfortable, that they feel good about it, and want to invest in this country.

“I think that the area that is silent in the Act that I want to really point out is the one around, if one has a solution, that you can actually approach government with the solution and get incentives from government.

“So, this is something that is not so obvious. But I think they tried to as much as possible bring that out. I think in the coming years or coming months, we would see clarity on how we can move forward on new projects that will be attractive to the investor, and that will be very good for the country itself.”

He, however, stated that the PIA brought clarity as to where government wants to drive the industry to, adding that most of the government’s aspirations and initiatives being pushed on gas were all expressed in the legislation.

On her part, Alboni, who was represented at the panel by the General Manager, Business Development and Government Relations, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Bashir Bello, said issues around Deepwater gas provisions in the PIA need to be reviewed to bring in better fiscal terms.

She explained that the review of the PIA for a better fiscal terms for gas investment would allow investors to support government efforts in achieving low carbon economy and increasing gas production.

Nigeria: Buhari to Sign Reworked Electoral Bill on Friday,"Barring any last minute changes, President Muhammadu Buhari may assent to the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him last month by the National Assembly, on Friday.

Presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, on Wednesday, confirmed to THISDAY that the signing of the bill was on Buhari’s schedule for Friday.

Shehu said, “Yes, the president will sign on Friday, God willing. It’s on his programme.”

Another reliable presidency source had earlier confirmed that the president was scheduled to assent to the bill at the State House, Abuja, about noon on Friday.

THISDAY had exclusively reported on Monday that the President was seeking assurances from the National Assembly leadership to amend clause 84 which barred political appointees from voting or being voted for in their party convention or congresses without first resigning from office. This was interpreted as an infringement of their constitutional right. The President was seeking assurances that the lawmakers would amend this clause to bring it in conformity with the constitution after he may have signed the bill. THISDAY checks indicate, those assurances may have been given.

Top government officials, including the leadership of the legislative arm, namely President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, would witness the signing ceremony for the electoral bill.

The top presidency source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, stated that arrangements had been finalised for the president to sign the amendment bill into law Friday.

According to the source, “All these anxieties will disappear by Friday afternoon. He will be signing the bill around noon of that day. I believe he has taken his time so that the Electoral Act can be as unassailable as much as possible.”

Public anxiety had mounted in the last few weeks over Buhari’s delay in assenting to the re-amended bill, as some members of the public as well as critical stakeholders had concluded that he was deliberately withholding assent again.

The National Assembly transmitted the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 to Buhari on January 31, a second time, having reportedly revised the bill, which he had withheld his assent to for some noted reasons.

The president was yet to assent to the bill, more than 20 days after it was transmitted to him, though he constitutionally has a 30-day window till March 1, within which he is mandated to either assent or state reasons for not doing so.

Buhari had first withheld his assent to the bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of the electoral process by political players as part of the reasons for his decision. He, however, gave some conditions for his assent, prompting the federal lawmakers to re-work the bill, which initially led to the emergence of two versions from the green and red chambers of the assembly.

Thereafter, the two chambers, in a conference committee, harmonised their position before transmitting the reworked bill to the president last month.

Meanwhile, Benson, in a chat with journalists in Abuja, argued that the clause, which sought to act as a leveller, did not in any way undermine the rights of political appointees to hold office or participate in primaries or main elections. He said the timeframe given by the clause (three months) for appointees to resign from their positions before conventions or congresses was only meant to place every aspirant on the same pedestal, and not to stop them from contesting, as being alleged in some sections of the public.

Benson stated, “Assuming without conceding that, that’s what it says in section 84(10) that appointees must resign three months before primaries or convention, let’s say it’s geared towards stopping political office holders from contesting, there’s a section of the constitution, which says that you shall resign 30 days before the general elections. If that constitutional provision clashes with the Electoral Act, which supersedes?

“So there’s no need to even worry about that clause if that’s the way they perceive it. But what we are trying to do is that for a convention or a congress, you have statutory delegates. But a governor will go and appoint 1,000 political appointees to participate in the congress, whom do you think will win? The governor will.

“So, we are saying no, you can’t do that. Let’s have a fixed number, manageable number. Let’s give a fair chance to you, you and you, and not to the stooge or the preferred candidate of the governor. So, that’s what that clause is trying to prevent. It is not trying to prevent political office holders from running. And I said even if does prevent political office holders from running, there’s a provision in the constitution that protects them.”

Nigeria: APC Zoning Presidency to South Puts PDP in Quandary,"The decision, Tuesday, by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country, might have put the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a quandary for contemplating to leave its own ticket open and by implication, put the north at advantage.

But the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, on Wednesday, reinforced the PDP position, when he declared that the zoning of the presidency to the South by the ruling party posed no threat to the main opposition party ahead of the 2023 general election.

His reaction may however underscore a concern in the party even though he tried to put a brave face on it.

Unfortunately for the PDP, the APC seems to be playing a rather smarter card, given the current mood of the nation, and especially, because while most of the governors in both parties wanted power to shift to the south of Nigeria, the governors, being life of the political parties, are consciously working to the answer.

Although in the PDP, such leaders like former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, are among those, who want the PDP ticket thrown open. The Southern PDP governors are also inclined to power shift.

However, the possibility that the PDP too might still go South is high, because once the party had zoned its chairmanship to the North, it is only ideal that its presidential ticket is taken South, a situation that would further give the APC an advantage of southern votes.

This is not to dismiss the understanding alleged to have been reached by PDP leaders at the point of making Dr. Iyorchia Ayu the national chairman of party, that if the equation changed at the point of choosing a presidential candidate, the chairman would resign if interests clashed.

Interestingly, and based on simple logic, many of the PDP governors knew that the APC would have an advantage in the south if the presidency was zoned to the south.

But the danger in this is that the party could lose the votes of some northern states as THISDAY had previously extrapolated, a development that could automatically put states like Rivers, Delta and Akwa Ibom in play for the APC that is fielding a Southern candidate.

What this means is that with a Southern presidential candidate by the ruling APC and without a concurrent Southern presidential standard bearer in the PDP, those key oil-rich Southern states could be won by APC, while not losing much ground in the north.

Another factor that many are currently considering as likely to work in favour of the APC is the Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso’s national movement, otherwise known as the third force.

The movement could divide the PDP further as well as shave valuable votes from the PDP in the North. In other words, the advantage the PDP hopes to gain in the north by potentially fielding a Northerner might be significantly eroded by Kwankwaso’s third force.

This, nonetheless, Mohammed, who spoke with journalists, shortly after a meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the PDP would continue to strategise to rescue Nigeria from the present situation she has found herself.

The governor, who described Obasanjo as a man with a lot of wisdom and an elder statesman per excellence, said he had come to seek his opinion on some of the things going on in the party.

His words: “To me, the zoning of Presidency to the South by the APC is not a threat to the PDP, because each party is trying to strategise, to plan and organise. If they zone to the South, it is open to us to see how it is going to give us more electoral victory or if we put it to the North, it will give us more electoral victory.

“This is the kind of things we are doing: the leg works, the permutations and so and so forth. So that, at least, whatever we are going to do, is to provide for Nigerians to choose between the best alternatives.”

While stressing the past relationship with Obasanjo, Mohammed said the issue of PDP, was basically one of the reasons for his visit.

He said, “We know that Baba is non-partisan; we know he is an elder statesman per excellence. But, we are rebuilding our party to remove rancour, division and so on. So, we still need him, because his words of wisdom are always very useful.

“So, I have come to sound his opinion on some of the things going on in the party; to close ranks and make sure that we provide Nigerians with the opportunity to rescue the country, from the present division going around, which we have found ourselves,” he said.

The Bauchi governor expressed optimism about his chances of getting the PDP presidential ticket to contest the 2023 election.

He said, “To me, presidency is a consensus – a stakeholder and a statesmanship – it is responsibilities. Of course, every Nigerian should try to contribute his or her quota to the growth and development of the nation.

“More so, when leadership recruitment should be based on merit, should be based on making sure that, we bring everybody on board and should not be based on manifestation of separatist, which are the instruments and the disgruntlement that are capable of dividing us further.

“Nigeria is too large and too important to be ignored. Some of us have benefited so much. It is not about me and my expression, but about the country.”

Funmi Ogun: Why I rejected Ekiti PDP's deputy governorship position,"By Idowu Ariwodola

Mrs Funmi Ogun, a close ally of ex-Ekiti Gov. Ayo Fayose on Thursday in Ado-Ekiti explained why she rejected her nomination as the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) deputy governorship candidate for the state’s June governorship election.

Mrs Ogun wo was Ekiti State Commissioner for Works during Fayose’s second term of office said the letter was not meant to slight anybody.

The rejection of the nomination letter, dated Feb. 24, 2022, and entitled: “Re: My Nomination as Deputy Governorship candidate’’ was and addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu.

“This is to formally inform you that I am not unaware of my nomination by Ekiti Stakeholders for the position of the Deputy Governorship Candidate in the June 18 2022 gubernatorial election.

“Notwithstanding their good intentions, I formally write to reject the nomination for personal reasons.

“However, I appreciate the uncommon recognition and I assure the party that no effort will be spared at ensuring our victory at the election,’’ she wrote.

Youthful Mrs Ogun was an influential member of cabinet in Fayose’s administration between 2016 and 2017.

Her rejection of the nomination came barely 24 hours to the submission of party nominations to INEC ahead of the June 18 governorship election.

Deadline for submission of nomination to the electoral body is June 25.

When contacted, the former commissioner confirmed authorship of the letter.

She explained that the leadership of the party in Ekiti State endorsed her as the deputy governorship candidate to Chief Kolawole and forwarded same to the party’s national secretariat.

“I confirm the authorship of the letter. It wasn’t meant to slight anybody.

“All the stakeholders in Ekiti State PDP endorsed me and forwarded my name to our national leadership, but the latter did not act on it.

“So, I have decided to reject my nomination so as not to be on a collision course or ruffle feathers with our national leaders.

“I have written this letter while awaiting the reaction of our leader, Ayo Fayose and the national leaders. This doesn’t suggest any trouble in Ekiti State PDP,’’ she said. (NAN)

"Ukraine: Remain neutral, foreign affairs expert urges Nigeria","The President of the Association of Foreign Relations Professionals in Nigeria, Ambassador Ganiyu Lawal, has urged the Nigerian government to remain neutral as the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its second day.

The News Agency of Nigeria reported that Lawal, on Friday, told reporters that diplomacy remained the best way to resolve conflicts.

The PUNCH had reported that Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022.

According to NAN, Lawal advised that, rather than taking sides, Nigeria should join other nations in suing for peace.

“At this time, it is important that the Nigerian government should remain neutral, as we have been non-align all along.

“Nigeria should join other countries suing for peace, because the world needs peace at this time more than ever.

“The Nigerian government has made arrangements for her citizens who want to leave to leave as soon as the airports are opened.

“Where it is not possible, a safe corridor will be negotiated for evacuation of civilians,” Lawal said.

Commenting on the crisis, Lawal berated actors for not observing rules of engagement or towing the path of diplomacy.

He said that the world had a strong diplomatic architecture put in place to forestall bullying of smaller countries by bigger powers, through collective security efforts.

He said further, “However, in the face of glaring bullying by bigger power, the whole world will rise against it under the principle of collective security.

“And the bigger power will be defeated, no matter how strong, since it cannot simultaneously do battle on multiple fronts.

“The implication is to allow peace to reign and refrain from provocative moves that threatens world peace, respect for the rule and spirit of the rule of engagement,” Lawal added.

The AFRPN president further said that the ongoing crisis would have a ripple effect on the economies of Africa, and Nigeria in particular, as African countries rely on importation, NAN reported.

Lawal stated that it is high time African nations started trading internally amongst one another to avoid the kind of effect that conflicts like this would have on import-based economies.

BREAKING: Buhari signs Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law,"The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 into law.

President Buhari signed the Bill at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, on Friday.

The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, were present to witness the signing of the Bill.

In his address, President Buhari said in line with established tradition, he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes in Nigeria.

He said, “It is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.

“The Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.

“These commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.

“Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.

“This, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.

“Section 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election. The section provides as follows: “No political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election”.

“This provision has introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.

“The practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).

“It is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.

“Hence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties’ conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.

“Arising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly.”

DJ Cuppy's regrets!,"A popular disc jockey, Florence Otedola also known as DJ Cuppy, may have regretted her decision to go back to school last year. This is because the move has seriously affected her career in music.”



The daughter of billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola, had in March last year announced that she was going back to school to pursue her master’s degree in African Studies at the University of Oxford, England.



She shared a picture of her letter of offer as well as a video informing her parents about the development on Instagram.



But in a tweet in the early hours of Wednesday, the “Gelato” crooner lamented that the programme is seriously affecting her growth in the country’s music industry.



“Some days I’m at @UniofOxford deeply regretting doing a 3rd university degree because I feel like it’s affecting my progress in the music industry. But some days like this, I’m really proud of myself and I know that education empowers me to be greater in every aspect of my life,” she tweeted in her dilemma. This would be Cuppy’s second master’s degree. She bagged one in Music Business from the New York University in 2015, including her first degree.

I thought my career had ended after Synagogue encounter — Jim Iyke,"•Jim Iyke relives memories of his Synagogue deliverance

Nine years after his alleged deliverance at late TB Joshua’s Synagogue Church Of All Nations, Nollywood actor Jim Iyke has relived memories of the encounter, saying “It almost ruined his acting career.”



The actor was at the church in 2013, following his quest to find a permanent healing for his ailing mother then.



Reliving his ugly experience during an interview with Chude Jideonwo, which was shared on Instagram, Jim Iyke said whatever happened at the church on that fateful day was not a stunt contrary to news that made rounds.



According to him, he was in dire straits over his mother’s ailment, hence his visit to the church.



Iyke said when orthodox medicine failed them after he took his mum to Houston and India in search of healing for her ailment, a senator friend of his advised him to take her to Synagogue led by late TB Joshua.



“When orthodox medicine failed us from Houston. I took my whole family to India to be with my mum and she started getting better. This is the light of your life for crying out loud, I am not going to wager it for theatrics, for melodrama.”

“At some point, an offer was made to us to take her to synagogue by a senator friend of mine. I refused but after much pressure from my family, I said okay, I want to go if they will save her, I will go,”



“They told us to put her in a hospital close to the church. There was a Presidential Suite I was accorded. While I was there, I said okay, let’s get started, they said I must come down to join the service . I said I don’t have to come down to join the service and that you people promised to heal her. Do God need me to be there…”



“I said I will live in this church for two years if you heal my mum.( ( So after a while, they had a meeting and said you need to come down. I remember I was there, my sister was behind me when this guy came and was doing stuff. When he crossed me, I chuckled.”

( “Then he came back to me, my brother I don’t know what happened after that.”



“This world is deep, there’s a spiritual something I’ve come to notice about this world that is way beyond us.”



“What happened I don’t know, I saw the video and said that’s not me but that was me. I am not an island of knowledge. I have done my part. But one thing that’s of a truth is that until I die, I am the true son of Gladys. I will never and ever do away with her memory and legacy by telling lies. I have said it time and again that if what I have said is not true, let somebody come and prove that he gave me money. My mum was in a coma in the hospital. What disappointed me was the fact that TB Joshua didn’t touch her, he didn’t even see her eye to eye. I thought my career has ended after that day,” Jim Iyke narrated.



Jim iyke’s synagogue deliverance session went viral in 2013 and nine years after that horrible experience the actor still feels hurt even though he has forgiven all those who were involved in the melodrama. He was said to have confessed that an evil spirit was tormenting his life during the session.

"NCC boss, Danbatta gives insights on Revenue Assurance Solution approved by FEC","The Executive Vice Chairman, EVC, of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Umar Garba Danbatta, has provided some insights into the development of Revenue Assurance Solution, RAS, which is designed to improve a very important aspect of the Commission’s regulatory initiatives.

The EVC and Chief Executive Officer spoke during a virtual interactive session with stakeholders on the deployment of RAS in the Nigerian telecommunications industry.

Danbatta explained that the annual Operating Levy, AOL, is a very important tool in the regulation of the telecommunications industry, adding that in Nigeria, its importance is well expressed in the Nigerian Communications Act 2003.

“AOL can be described as the taproot of an efficient and effective telecommunications regulatory environment,” the EVC said, adding that the “mechanisms for collection and computation of AOL, are of interest and importance to both the regulator and the operating networks.”

Speaking further, Danbatta explained, “Since the NCA 2003 came into force, various efforts have been made towards achieving a very effective AOL administration, pursuant to the powers of the Commission under Section 72 of the NCA Act 2003.

“One of these key efforts include the making of the Regulations 2014, which is also currently undergoing review.

“Some of the major objectives of the AOL Regulations, as provided in Part 1 (2) of the AOL Regulations 2014, are to:

(a) Create and provide a regulatory framework for the effective and efficient administration by the Commission of the Annual Operating Levy regime and all matters related thereto;

(b) Stipulate the mode and methods of assessment of Annual Operating Levy and the payment modes thereof; and,

(c) Specify guiding standards and principles for the administration by the Commission of the Annual Operating Levy regime.

“The Commission has committed time and efforts to give vent to the provisions of this regulation in particular, and the administration of AOL, generally, in the best interest of the industry.

“The Commission believes that the deployment of appropriate revenue assurance solutions would enhance monitoring and regulatory activities around AOL administration, and confer higher levels of integrity and fidelity on the AOL figures obtainable in the industry.

“In some countries where the systems have been deployed, including some African countries, appropriate revenue assurance systems have resulted in higher revenues and plugging of leakages.

“Modern revenue assurance systems have also shown to be equipped with additional capacities to generate and analyse information beyond those required for revenue computation.

“Hence, our desire to deploy the most appropriate revenue assurance systems in the Nigerian telecommunications industry began in 2015 when Commission published an invitation to bid for the services.

“With the emergence of a preferred bidder, 3R Company Nigeria Ltd, the Bureau of Public Procurement, BPP, offered no objection but further advised that due to the scope of the project, the solution would be more appropriately procured under a Public-Private Partnership, PPP, arrangement and further recommended that the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, ICRC, be invited to guide the process as mandated by its regulations.

“Pursuant to this development, the Commission set up a Project Delivery Team, PDT, which worked with a consortium of legal advisers, financial modellers and PPP experts under the guidance of ICRC, took the appropriate steps required under the ICRC Regulation 200

“Part of the process, include proper due diligence of the preferred partner, which received a clean bill of health from the Office of the National Security Adviser, NSA.

“The Commission also subjected the software and hardware components of the proposed system to the certification of the National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA.

“On December 17, 2021, the transaction received the Certificate of Compliance from the ICRC in line with the Provisions of the ICRC Act 2005.

“On the strength of this status, our Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isah Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) graciously presented the NCC RAS project to the Federal Executive Council Meeting of January 26, 2022, where the final approval form the implementation of the solution was finally approved.

“We have invited you to share in this major milestone. We want to carry the industry along this very important path towards effective revenue assurance in the industry.

“We are very pleased that the Federal Executive Council, FEC, considered it appropriate to approve this transaction.

“We also considered this approval as a very significant milestone that needs to be shared with you, our key stakeholders for purposes of cooperation and collaboration to make a success of this initiative.

“The Nigerian telecommunications industry, and revenue events engaged by the network operators, demand effective, accurate, and technology-driven revenue assurance solutions which NCC-RAS represents.

“Therefore, this project relieves the Commission of the initial financial burden that will be required for the deployment of the RAS project.

“It will also ensure that accurate revenue generated by the licensed network operators are tracked, analyzed and utilized for the benefit of the industry.

“Beyond revenue assurance, when deployed, the NCC RAS will bring a lot of solutions to the industry, including more effective and enhanced monitoring and regulation of the licensed telecommunications operators by the Commission.

“The system is designed to be connected to the licensed telecommunications operators’ systems and will have the capability of capturing and reporting in near real-time billing activities by the operators for the purposes, amongst others, of computing and assuring with minimal, if any, error margin, the accrued AOL payable to the NCC by the licensees.

“Therefore, in addition to plugging possible loopholes and leakages in the revenue computation and collection processes, the RAS would enable the Commission to validate the information, records and data that are supplied to the Commission by the licensees from time to time regarding, amongst others, the revenue stream and profitability of the telecommunications industry.

“The RAS project is very significant to the telecommunications industry.

“The private partner, a consortium is known as 3R Revenue Assurance Solution Ltd, (3RRAS) will be responsible for the system for a Ten Years tenure as provided in the requisite Full Business Case (FBC) under a Design, Finance, Build, Operate, and Transfer, DFBOT and the Public-Private Partnership Agreement, PPPA.

“We are also particularly delighted that this private partnership initiative contributes to our commitment to strategic partnering which is one of the key pillars of our Strategic Management Plan 2020-2024.”","“In some countries where the systems have been deployed, including some African countries, appropriate revenue assurance systems have resulted in higher revenues and plugging of leakages.

Ganduje has many corruption cases to answer – Anti-corruption committee,"The Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, PACAC, has said Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has some cases of corruption to answer.

PACAC Executive Secretary, Sadiq Radda, said Ganduje has many cases to answer while in office and at the end of his tenure.

Radda disclosed this at the 26th Anti-Corruption Situation Room (ACSR) assessment held in Abuja yesterday.

He recalled how the governor’s son dragged his mother to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.

In October last year, Ganduje’s wife, Hafsat, was arrested by the EFCC over alleged fraud.

She was arrested following a petition by her son, Abdulazeez.

Abdulazeez had accused his mother of receiving bribes and involving herself in a fraudulent deal.

However, Radda said: “The governor has many cases to answer while in office and even more after leaving office.

"Fish out policeman who killed our member – OPC tells IGP, Oyo Police Commissioner","The Oyo State chapter of Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) has urged the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, and the Commissioner of Police in the state, Ngozi Onadeko, to without waiting more time fish out the policeman who killed a member of the organisation.

The association noted that the need to bring the erring policeman to book is necessary so as the death of their member is not in vain.

DAILY POST had earlier reported that a member of OPC identified as Morufu Ganiyu on Saturday, died as a result of gunshot wounds he sustained during an encounter with a policeman in Ibadan. Our correspondent gathered that Ganiyu was, until his death, a leader of a private security outfit in the area.

Our correspondent gathered that the policeman attached to Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (F-SARS), Lagos State, Obasanjo Atoyebi shot Ganiyu on Thursday, 17th February this year. The incident occurred at Imalefalafia junction, Oke-Ado area of Ibadan.

Atoyebi is reportedly fond of shooting into the air twice every night whenever he is in Ibadan, where his family resides.

Investigation revealed that around 11:30 pm on Thursday, 17th February, when Atoyebi came back home, he fired twice in the air. It was gathered that Ganiyu was in the vicinity that night to supervise his boys when he heard the gunshots.

Some of the residents of the area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Ganiyu moved to the area to confront Atoyebi on why he was shooting unnecessarily.

Our correspondent gathered that the policeman allegedly shot the OPC member twice in the process. The deceased later died on Saturday as a result of the injury he sustained.

OPC coordinator in the state, Rotimi Olumo, while calling for proper investigation, urged both the police at the federal and state levels to fish out the policeman who shot their member which resulted in his death.

Olumo who spoke with DAILY POST on Friday explained that the arrest and prosecution of the policeman would serve as a deterrent to other erring officers.

“The incident occurred on Thursday, 17th February this year. We learnt that one of our members named Morufu Ganiyu who is providing private security for the car dealers at Imalefalafia up till Iyana Ososami area was shot twice by a policeman known as Obasanjo Atoyebi.

“Obasanjo Atoyebi has one wife there and he usually comes at midnight. The people of the areas have complained bitterly about his unnecessary shootings at midnight whenever he arrived.

“On that fateful day, Obasanjo Atoyebi fired gunshots when he arrived the area in the midnight. He has a pistol that he usually puts it in his pocket. Morufu Ganiyu challenged him on why he arrived at that time and why the unnecessary shootings.

“Obasanjo Atoyebi then shot him twice. He first shot him in the chest and when he discovered that he did not die, he later shot him in the stomach.

“Those who were around rushed him to a hospital where they removed the bullets. They removed the one at the chest but, the man died because they could not remove the one in the stomach.

“What we are saying is that once a soldier is a soldier forever. He is a Yoruba man. Morufu Ganiyu was one of our coordinators.

“Is it alright for a policeman to be killing members of the public? Whether a dismissed policeman or serving policeman.

“We are using this medium to inform the federal and state governments that Obasanjo Atoyebi should not go unpunished. Morufu Ganiyu should not die in vain. If the activity of a person like Ayoyebi is not challenged many of them will do such a thing.

“We are using this medium to tell the IGP and the commissioner of police in Oyo State to fish out Atoyebi for him to pay for the offence he committed”.

But, efforts made to get a reaction from the spokesman of Oyo State Police command, Adewale Osifeso, proved abortive as calls put through to his phone were not answered. He also did not respond to text messages sent to him for comments.","Our correspondent gathered that the policeman attached to Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (F-SARS), Lagos State, Obasanjo Atoyebi shot Ganiyu on Thursday, 17th February this year.

"How to solve Nigeria’s challenges, by Buhari, Gowon, others","By Eric Ikhilae and Frank Ikpefan, Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari, former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi and his Kano State counterpart, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, as well as some other eminent Nigerians have suggested ways the nation should take to overcome its current challenges and attain greatness.

President Buhari urged Nigerians to look for quality leadership who are driven by vision and experience, while Dr. Gowon said the country requires a leader with a mindset that sees beyond the 21 century.

Both leaders agreed that the vision of the nation’s founding fathers had not been realised, but said it is work in progress and hoped for a better future.

Dignitaries at the event included All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart, Chief Bisi Akande, Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Abubakar Bagudu (Kebbi), Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Works and Housing Minister Babatunde Fashola (SAN) and Dr. Tope Fasua (who represented APC stalwart, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu).

Others are: former Ogun State Governor Ibikule Amosu; Finance, Budget and National Planning Minister, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo (SAN); Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; and Minister of State for Mine and Steel Development, Uchechukwu Ogah.

Fayemi said the nation needs purposeful leadership with the capacity to harness its potentials and address its challenges.

Ganduje urged more intellectuals to be involved in governance and quit seeing politics as a dirty game.

The eminent Nigerians spoke yesterday in Abuja at the public presentation of a book, titled: Unfinished Greatness: Envisioning A New Nigeria, written by Fayemi.

President Buhari, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, hailed Fayemi for writing the book and for his contributions to governance in the country.

On the importance of visionary leadership, he said: “Practice and politicking without a vision can also become extremely unproductive for a country that needs to move forward.

“So, it is a combination of people of vision, intellect and practice; experience, record of achievement in public service, that, in my view, qualify people for leadership.

“It is not a question of a choice between practitioners and intellectuals but a combination of vision for a society; a combination of experienced people who have demonstrated capacity in articulating the need of a society and helping to implement that.”

Gowon, who chaired the event, argued that although the nation may not have adequately addressed its leadership question since Independence, it should not be deterred from its search.

“The second notion of envisioning a new Nigeria addresses the leadership question. Our country may not have got this right for much of our 62 years as an independent nation, but I think we have all done our best; that this should not undermine our search for quality leadership – the kind with a mindset that sees father than even the 21 century.

“We speak of leadership that seeks to make our unity and diversity work. We speak of leadership that makes our borders – internal and external -safe for everyone,” he said.

Fayemi noted that although no country is immune from challenges, state and nation-building, all over the world, remain a permanent work in progress but driven by committed and visionary leaders.

The keynote speaker and Research Director at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, urged Nigerian leaders to evolve local solutions to the nation’s challenges.

The book reviewer, a visiting lecturer at the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance in the Netherlands, Dr. Joe Abah, noted that the book makes a compelling argument for the need to restructure Nigeria and for decentralisation and devolution of powers, predicated on an honest national dialogue.","President Buhari urged Nigerians to look for quality leadership who are driven by vision and experience, while Dr. Gowon said the country requires a leader with a mindset that sees beyond the 21 century.

2023: Business group pressures Osinbajo to contest for presidency,"From Fred Itua, Abuja

A group, Business Men For Osinbajo (BFO), has urged Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to run for the 2023 presidential election promising to buy the All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination form for him.

Its convener, Dr. Tayo Fashogbon, stated this on Wednesday night in Abuja during the inauguration of the support group.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

At the event attended by prominent businessmen, Fashogbo said they were wooing Osinbajo for the continuity of the projects and programmes of the President Muhammadu Buhari.

He said though Osinbajo was yet to declare his interest for the presidency, the group was putting structures in place to ensure he emerges the next president.

“He is competent, versatile and knowledgeable of the dynamics of the Nigerian business environment and the global economy,” he said.

The BFO convener said Osinbajo has not declared his presidential ambition because as a legal icon, he is aware that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has not lifted the ban on electioneering and would therefore not jump the gun.

In order not to be caught unprepared, Fashogbo said the group resolved to go ahead with its inauguration so that there would be strategic planning and coordination of its activities.

“I stand here to welcome you on this journey towards an elevated Nigeria. This elevation will be brought about by a more intentional participation of the business community in the democracy of Nigeria. Until now, the business community, with all its great contributions, has only remained on the fringes of political relevance. This has continued to limit our capacity to influence the ease and outcomes of doing business,” he said.

Co-convener of BFO, Mr. Olatunji Davies, said business owners were pushing for an Osinbajo presidency because of his acceptability by Nigerians, irrespective of the economic, social, religious and ethnic background.

Davies said Osinbajo’s acceptance is further confirmed by the rate various political leaders their political inclination notwithstanding invites him to commission projects they have executed in their states.

“Our group called the Business Men for Osinbajo (BFO) is officially launched as a first major step to change the narrative.

Opebi plane crash: Aircraft didn’t have sufficient fuel for destination –AIB,"Accident Investigation Bureau of Nigeria (AIB-N) has revealed that the cause of the aircrash involving Quorum Aviation’s Bell 206 helicopter, 5N- BQW, which went down at Opebi in Lagos State in August 2020, claiming the lives of all crew onboard was caused by lack of sufficient fuel in the aircraft. It also stated that in spite of this challenge, the pilot still wanted to get to destination even after noticing that.

Speaking during the realease of four accident reports in Abuja on Thursday, AIB-N Commissioner, Akin Olateru, said there was fuel exhaustion at low altitude and the low speed landing led to loss of control in flight. The report also stated that the decision of the pilot to continue the flight to the intended destination with insufficient fuel instead of landing as soon as practicable in line with section: 12.1.12 of Quorum Aviation limited operations manual Part A, contributed to the cause of crash. The report also blamed lack of effective management supervision of the airline’s flight operations as well as inadequate safety oversight. “The Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA) should ensure that air operator certificate holders who wish to combine flight duty with multiple post position, provide NCAA with comprehensive safety risk mitigation measures to ensure that safe operations can be achieved.

Global outrage followed yesterday’s attacks launched by Russia on major cities and infrastructure in Ukraine, with the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), among others, describing it as an unprovoked aggression, and imposing a series of sanctions on Russia.

Russian media had quoted President Vladimir Putin as saying he had given approval for the operation in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk, and said they had asked for “help”.

Owing to the attack, oil prices jumped yesterday, with Brent rising above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, after the attack exacerbated concerns about disruptions to global energy supply. On the other hand, global markets plunged.

According to the BBC, the invasion by land, air, and sea began after a pre-dawn TV address, where the Russian President demanded that Ukraine’s military lay down their arms. Initial reports of casualties included Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, and Russian troops.

The Ukraine’s leader had said his country “won’t give up its freedom.”

“Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself,” President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted.

Ukraine declared martial law and severed all diplomatic relations with Russia. It said weapons would be given to anyone who wanted them.

The Russian attack began around 4:30 am in Ukraine yesterday, with a barrage of over 100 ballistic, cruise and surface-to-air missiles, and included 75 medium and heavy bombers. Experts said the invasion was the largest in Europe since World War II. The fighting, described as an initial phase, could potentially become very bloody and very costly, they added.

Explosions were heard in major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa. Oleksii Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said at least 40 people had been killed and dozens others wounded in the attack so far.

Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces had hit military assets and other defence facilities, while footage shared by Ukrainian border guards showed Russian military vehicles moving across the border from Crimea.

Zelenskyy had announced that Ukraine had cut diplomatic ties with Russia, declaring martial law and offering to issue weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Despite pleas to stay home, people in Kyiv were jamming roads to leave.

But as global outrage swelled, Putin met with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday. The prime minister’s office posted a video to Twitter of the two leaders shaking hands and said the pair would discuss “the entire gamut of Pakistan-Russia bilateral cooperation, and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.”

U.S Reaction

President Joe Biden yesterday forcefully condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a premeditated attack and a brutal assault “without provocation, without justification, without necessity.

“Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months.”

Biden announced new sanctions that included banning exports to Russia.

“We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximise a long-term impact on Russia and to minimise impact on the United States and our allies,” Biden said.

Biden used his strongest language to date about Putin, saying the U.S. and allies will make sure he becomes “pariah on the international stage.”

Biden met earlier yesterday morning with his national security team and world leaders, hours after Putin ordered the attack on Ukraine in the predawn darkness.

The U.S. already has about 90,000 troops in Europe and has deployed more to the continent as tensions simmered in the weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this month, about 5,000 US-based forces were sent to Europe and US military personnel already there had been shifting to help bolster NATO’s eastern flank.

Biden said members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and others had joined a global coalition to amplify a united response. He also said G-7 leaders agreed to limit Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. The president said the US would block four more major banks in addition to the sanctions imposed on VTB and Russia’s military bank.

Biden said the United States was taking steps to defend NATO allies.

The organisation will convene a summit today, which would “bring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance,” Biden said.

“This aggression cannot go unanswered. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom,” he added.

Biden said his administration was going to use “every tool” to protect Americans and businesses from rising gas prices.

He called on American oil and gas companies to “not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.”

The US president said, “Our sanctions package is specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue. We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption.”

The White House sounded the alarm last week to prepare the country for potential cyber-attacks on US companies or key parts of U.S. critical infrastructure, including pipelines, banks, commercial aviation, and hospitals.

Clinton Condemns ‘Unprovoked and Unjustified’ Russian attack on Ukraine

Former US President Bill Clinton yesterday condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, joining world leaders, past and present, in rebuking Putin.

“Putin’s war of choice has unravelled 30 years of diplomacy, with the potential for mass civilian casualties and huge displacements both within Ukraine’s borders and beyond,” Clinton said in a prepared statement posted to his Twitter account.

He called the invasion “unprovoked and unjustified” and a “brazen violation of international law.”

“The world will hold Russia and Russia alone accountable, both economically and politically,” he said.

UK’s Johnson Outlines Severe Sanctions against Russia, Belarus

In his address today, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged a “vast invasion” is underway and said the world “cannot allow that freedom” of Ukraine to be “snuffed out”.

He assured the UK will “do what more we can in the days ahead”, including agreeing a “massive package of economic sanctions”.

Johnson continued, “Our mission is clear: diplomatically, politically, economically and, eventually, militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Putin must end in failure.”

The prime minister addressed the people of Russia, Ukraine and Britain separately in his address, telling those in Russia that he “cannot believe” the invasion has been launched “in your name”.

He assured Ukrainians the UK was “on [their] side”, and told Brits the government “will do everything to keep our country safe”, including working with allies for “however long it takes” to ensure the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine was restored.

Johnson said the United Kingdom was imposing “the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen” and that sanctions would also apply to Belarus for its role in Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

In coordination with the US, Johnson said the United Kingdom was imposing a “full asset freeze” on the Russian-owned bank VTB that will effectively exclude Russian banks from UK’s financial system.

“I’m pleased to tell the House that the United States is taking similar measures,” Johnson told the House of Commons.

He said the UK would implement new trade and export restrictions similar to what the US would also impose

The prime minister said Russian companies, both private and state-owned, would be prohibited from raising funds in the UK, taking loans out of the UK, and making securities transactions in the UK

“This includes all the major manufacturers that support Putin’s war machine,” Johnson said.

Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters yesterday gathered in London to urge Britain and other democracies to step up action against Russia. Ukrainians living in the UK and activists gathered outside the prime minister’s Downing Street office singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

Natalia Ravlyuk, who helped organise the protest, said they wanted the “toughest sanctions and total isolation of Russia now.”

“We feel betrayed by democratic states because we have been talking about this war for eight years,” she said. “They just need to wake up and stop Putin now,” the Associated Press quoted her as saying.

NATO chief: Russia’s Ukraine invasion ‘cold-blooded’ and ‘long-planned’

NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned,” accusing Putin of “using force to re-write history.”

Speaking in Brussels, Stoltenberg called for a summit of NATO alliance leaders on Friday to address Moscow’s military incursion into neighbouring Ukraine and said the military alliance would be bolstering its land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank. Stoltenberg confirmed NATO did not have any troops inside Ukraine and did not plan to send any, but said the alliance was still committed to providing Kyiv with military and technical support.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO but other countries close to the theatre of conflict, including Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania, are. Under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, all are entitled to direct military support if their “territorial integrity, political independence or security” is threatened.

G-7 leaders: Putin Has Put Himself on Wrong Side of History’

Following a virtual meeting yesterday morning, leaders of the G-7 issued a joint statement announcing they would bring forward “severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions” and calling on the global community to condemn the attack in the strongest terms possible.

The leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, along with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, and NATO Secretary-General called the unfolding conflict “a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe.”

The leaders called on Moscow to end the bloodshed and condemned Belarus’ involvement in Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.

“This has fundamentally changed the Euro-Atlantic security situation,” the statement read. “President Putin has re-introduced war to the European continent. He has put himself on the wrong side of history.”

George Bush: Invasion Unprovoked, Unjustified’

In a similar vein, former US President George W. Bush condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine as “the gravest security crisis on the European continent since World War II.”

The invasion was “unprovoked and unjustified,” Bush said in a statement.

Bush, who once described Putin as “very straightforward and trustworthy,” said the US government and the American people must stand in solidarity with Ukraine and its people as they sought freedom “and the right to choose their own future.

“We cannot tolerate the authoritarian bullying and danger that Putin poses.”

He said, “Ukraine is our friend and democratic ally and deserves our full support during this most difficult time.”

Oil Prices Hit $105 Per Barrel

Oil prices jumped yesterday with Brent rising above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, after Russia’s attack on Ukraine exacerbated concerns about disruptions to global energy supply.

Senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, Louise Dickson, told Reuters, “Oil prices are soaring with no end in sight as the news of Russia’s full-scale military incursion of Ukraine, immediately putting at risk up to 1 million bpd (barrels per day) of Russian crude oil exports transitioning through Ukraine and the Black Sea,”

At least three major buyers of Russian oil were unable to open letters of credit from Western banks to cover purchases on Thursday, sources told Reuters.

Global benchmark Brent crude rose $6.61, or 6.8 per cent, to $103.45, after touching a high of $105.79.

Also, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped $4.78, or 5.2 per cent, to $96.88 a barrel, after earlier rising to $100.54. Brent and WTI hit their highest since August and July 2014, respectively.

“Russia is the third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter. Given low inventories and dwindling spare capacity, the oil market cannot afford large supply disruptions,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

“Supply concerns may also spur oil stockpiling activity, which supports prices.”

Russia is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe, providing about 35 per cent of its supply.

China warned of the impact of tensions on the stability of the energy market.

“All countries that are truly responsible should take responsible actions to jointly maintain global energy security,” a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said.

Globally, oil supplies remain tight as demand recovers from pandemic lows.

Reflecting the tightness, the premium on Brent contracts for loading in one month over contracts for loadings in six months, a metric closely watched by traders, hit a record high at $11.55 a barrel.

Analysts said Brent was likely to remain above $100 a barrel until significant alternative supplies become available from US shale or Iran, for example.

The United States and Iran have been engaged in indirect nuclear talks in Vienna that could lead to the removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales.

Analysts are warning of inflationary pressure on the global economy from $100 oil, especially for Asia, which imports most of its energy needs.

“Asia’s Achilles heel remains its vast import needs for energy, with surging oil prices bound to take a hefty bite out of income and growth over the coming year,” said HSBC economist Frederic Neumann.

House Seeks Immediate Evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine

As the conflict worsens, the House of Representatives has directed its leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa, and Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Hon. Yakub Buba, to liaise with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, National Intelligence Agency, and Ukrainian embassy to see that Nigerian students in Ukraine were immediately evacuated.

Moving a motion of urgent national importance at the plenary yesterday, Hon. Ahmed Munir lamented that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was deteriorating by the hour.

Munir pointed out that Nigeria had a significant number of undergraduate and graduate students currently studying in Ukraine, with a good number of them under government scholarships. This, he said, included a number of Nigerian diplomats and their families in the Kiev Embassy and Nigerian expatriates across Ukraine.

He expressed concern that if a strategic plan was not put in place to secure and provide safe passage for Nigerian citizens, they may be trapped or worse, harmed.

The lawmaker urged his colleagues to mandate its Committees on Foreign Affairs and diaspora, in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to ascertain the exact figures of Nigerians affected by this conflict and put in place a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and evaluation mechanism.

Contributing, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, amended the prayer calling for an interface with the ministry, NIA and embassy for immediate evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine.

Gbajabiamila said since a state of emergency had been declared on the conflict, urgent action needed to be taken to ensure safety of the citizens.

The Speaker told the lawmakers that if nothing positive came out of their meeting with the stakeholders today, then they should immediately contact the chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, regardless of the cost and head to Ukraine tomorrow (Friday) and evacuate the students on Monday.

Gbajabiamila said, “This is a very important motion that we discussed. Time is of the essence. A state of emergency has been declared, I listened to the news yesterday, even America said it’s not going to be bloodless. We should be more proactive and I think it’s better late than never. It’s important that at this point to forget all the bureaucratic bottlenecks, and look out for our citizens, especially students.

“Action needs to be taken now and my thought is that leader of the House Hon. Ado Doguwa, and Chairman, Foreign Affairs, Hon. Buba Yakub, should liaise with the ministry foreign affairs, NIA and embassy in Ukraine and if nothing positive comes out of it, then we should liaise with chairman Air Peace. Whatever it’s going to cost the House, you need to leave this country latest tomorrow and come back on Monday with many of our students.”

Why Buhari Settled for Adamu as Consensus Candidate for APC Chair,"*Al-Makura, Mustapha, Dafe kick; say it’s media game

*Stakeholders insist on open contest for chairmanship

*Ruling party appoints zonal congress committees

Iyobosa Uwugiaren, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Juliet Akoje in Abuja

Reports that President Muhammadu Buhari might have settled for a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as his consensus candidate for the office of the national chairman, is true.

But more details have also emerged on why the president settled for Adamu, despite the fact that he has seemingly unending cases with the nation’s number one anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

Nonetheless, three other aspirants to the same office, namely, Tanko Al makura, Saliu Mustapha and Sunny Moni Dafe, had immediately rejected the “purported” adoption of Adamu by the president.

In addition to the disavowal by other contestants, a group of concerned APC North-West stakeholders, has insisted that those aspiring to the exalted seat of APC chairmanship should be allowed to test their popularity and therefore, the contest should be thrown open.

This, notwithstanding, the leadership of the ruling party, has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses to be held on March 12, 2022.

Different sources confided in THISDAY yesterday that the inroads made by Senator Adamu in reconciling aggrieved members of the party that attracted him to Buhari as a likely choice for party’s chairmanship.

But some governors, especially, those from north central were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, insisting that since the national chairman, has been zoned to the geo-political, they should be allowed to decide who picks the position.

Besides, the purported endorsement of Adamu has also not gone down well with other aspirants and governors, as they claimed that he was not among the aspirants, as his name only popped up last week before President Buhari travelled to Brussels, Germany.

Before his departure, the president was said to have asked for the names of all the aspirants and his name was added.

Governor Sule of Nasarawa State and his counterpart in Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdurazak, were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, but backed Al-Makura.

Another governor from the zone, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, THISDAY was told, also rejected the purported adoption of Adamu.

Mustapha, on his part, told THISDAY yesterday that against the media speculations, the President has not adopted Admau, describing it as “a media game.”

According to him, “My governor (Governor Abdulrazaq of Kwara) told me that the matter of who becomes the next national chairman of our party has not been discussed.”

Mustapha, who maintained that the matter was not discussed at the APC governors’ meeting with the president, told THISDAY that the president only approved the zoning of offices as presented to him by the APC-elected governors.

“At the meeting, no name was mentioned. It was only the approval of the zoning of offices that was presented and the president only approved the zoning and asked the governors to go about it diligently to ensure peace.

“The President Buhari that I know will not like to do things secretly. This is a media game by those concerned. I don’t know what they want to achieve.”

Another aspirant, Monidafe, questioned the aid adoption of Adamu, claiming that if it wastrue, why has the president not officially announced it?

Senator Al-Makura, in a statement by Segun Tomo, the Director, New Media, Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO), also denied that Adamu has been adopted as the national chairman of APC.

“The attention of the Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO) has been drawn to wide speculations and propaganda making the rounds in some news outlets that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed the candidacy of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu as the next Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

“While we would have ordinarily ignored the widespread rumours, we have been inundated with calls and apprehension of Sen. Umaru Tanko Al-Makura’s supporters across the country. Therefore, we decided to respond, and set the records straight.

“Information at our disposal indicate that what transpired at the meeting of the governors with the president was the ratification of the new convention date and agreement on the zoning formula.

“On the issue of who becomes chairman, the president asked that consultations continue to produce a credible and widely accepted choice as consensus candidate.

“One does not need a soothsayer to know that Al-Makura fits the bill. Across the length and breadth of the country, Sen. Al-Makura is seen as a bridge-builder, a leader imbued with a calm temperament, renowned with an impeccable mobilization skills and political sagacity that ensured he defeated the then entrenched Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State.”

Stakeholders Insist on Open Chairmanship Contest

Concerned APC North-West Stakeholders forum, has insisted that those aspiring for the chairmanship of the party should be allowed to test their popularity, openly.

National Convener of the group, Alhaji Sani Abubakar, in a statement argued that the call was necessitated by the purported move to impose Senator Abdullahi Adamu as chairman of the party.

The group expressed convern that some of the party’s governors from the North West geopolitical zone were already dropping the name of President Muhammadu Buhari purely to promote the candidacy of Senator Abdullahi Adamu.

The group cautioned some members of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) to thread with caution so as not to destroy the APC, saying there would be consequences for any act that causes problems for the party.

“The stakeholders have become aware that members of the PGF from the north-west, who championed this errant position are acting out their own greed and personal agenda, which is that each of them is hopeful of emerging the running mate to an eventual APC presidential candidate from the south.

“It is most unfortunate that people, who currently (individually) hold the mandate for the wellbeing of millions of people as state governors are unable to subjugate their selfish interest for national interest, party loyalty and the long-term stability of Nigeria’s democracy.

“It is tragic how these individuals overheated the polity simply out of desperation to occupy a position that is not zoned to their areas. These persons from the north-west looking for the position of vice president that, going by our history as a nation, it is well known that the best the region could get after 2023 is the national chairmanship position of the party.

“All those pushing for a candidate from the north central to be made a consensus chairman of the party, which has earlier been zoned to the north west, are traitors and seem to only be interested in rubbishing Mr. President’s legacies in office by appending his name as mark of approval to their plans.”

APC Appoints Zonal Congress Committees

The All Progressives Congress (APC), has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses slated for March 12, 2022.

National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe disclosed this in a statement issued yesterday I’m Abuja.

He said, “The chairmen of the committees are all members of the CECPC, while secretaries are selected from amongst the deputy governors from their respective geo-political zones.

“Meetings of zonal stakeholders hold on Saturday, 26 February, 2022 at the respective geo-political zones.” Akpanudoedehe disclosed.

For the North-Central zone, the Governor of Niger SState, Abubakar Bello was appointed chairman, while Prof. Sonni Tyoden will serve as the secretary.

The party appointed Senator Yusuf Yusuf as the chairman for the North-east Zone, while Mr. Manasseh Jatau, will serve as the secretary.

The APC appointed Mr. David Lyon as the chairman for the South-south, while Prof. Ivara Esu, will serve as the secretary.

Akpanudoedehe said Senator Abba Ali would serve as the committee chairman for the Northwest zone, while Hadiza Balarabe is the secretary.

Hon. Akinremi Olaide was appointed as the chairman for the South-west zone and Dr. Kadiri Hamzat is the secretary.

Buhari: I Look Forward to Leaving Office Next Year,"*Says Nigeria’s constitution bars him from going beyond two terms as president

Deji Elumoye in Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that the nation’s constitution statutorily barred him from going beyond two terms as President.

This is just as he said he was looking forward to leaving office by May 29, 2023.

Speaking yesterday, during a courtesy visit to the palace of Emir of Lafia, retired Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad 1, the President stressed that he has no intention whatsoever to stay beyond the constitutionally recognised two terms of office as leader of Nigeria.

He said: ”The traditional ruler is on a terminal appointment. Constitutionally, we (elected public office holders) are not. I cannot go beyond two terms and I have sworn by the Holy Quran that I will uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

According to him, leaders who take the oath of office, swearing with the Holy Book, must be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God.

”Politics apart, whenever we are made to swear by the Holy Quran, we have to be very careful. We must make sure that we do not abuse the trust God has given us as leaders.

”I have seen former Governors here and I am looking forward to also becoming a former President,” he said.

Buhari thanked the people of Nasarawa State for the rousing welcome, expressing delight that the north-central state was wearing a new look since his last visit in 2019.

He congratulated the immediate past Governor and Senator representing Nasarawa South Senatorial District, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura and the incumbent, Governor Abdullahi Sule for the laudable initiatives and accomplishments in the state.

Welcoming the president to the over 200-year old palace, the Emir of Lafia thanked him for ending the problem of insufficient power to Nasarawa State with the provision of 330kVA sub-station.

The Emir, who is also the Chairman, Nasarawa State Council of Chiefs, told the president that the provision of the electricity plant, ”has taken out 80 percent of our problem.”

”Our people have never had it so good. Our people are back to their normal life as entrepreneurs, ” he said, adding that the federal government projects that were, ”standing as ghosts” in the state in the past have now become a reality.

The monarch listed the newly inaugurated CBN Building in Lafia, the Federal Secretariat, UBEC Smart School and completed Ecological projects, just to mention but a few.

On arrival in the capital for a two-day State visit to Nasarawa state, Buhari inaugurated the Lafia Airport, Vocational and Skills Acquisition Centre, Modern Bus Terminal and the Shinge-Barkini Abdullahi-Kilema road, executed by the State Government.

He also inaugurated CBN Lafia Branch building and a 330kva Akurba Transmission Substation executed by the Federal Government through the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) to boost power supply in the state and its environs.

"BREAKING: Police Reinvite Sowore After Illegal Arrest As Buhari's Minister, Malami, Nwoko Secure Judge To Remand Activist In Prison Custody","

The Nigeria Police Force has again invited human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore over a frivolous petition by a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko.



A team of armed policemen who laid siege to the entrance of the Court of Appeal had on Thursday arrested Sowore.

He was taken to the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit, otherwise known as Abattoir, located at Guzape where he was detained for hours.



A police source told SaharaReporters that Nigeria's Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and Nwoko were unhappy the activist was released.



The source added that the duo has secured a judge to remand Sowore in prison as soon as he honours today’s invitation.



“Ned and the AGF are unhappy that we released him last night. They have secured a judge to remand in prison custody today,” the source said.



Confirming his invitation on Twitter, Sowore said, “@mBuhari cabal members led by Malami are so scared now, they want to take me before a judge & send me to prison so that I won’t be able to declare for presidency early next week! We are more than ready! #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”

“Earlier yesterday morning a group of well-armed govt sponsored miscreants attacked our contingent, assaulted and stole their phones in the Gudu area of Abuja on our way to the Court of Appeal.

“The case was immediately reported to the police but they did nothing about it. It turns out it was part of a bigger plot as later in the afternoon a group of well-armed policemen accosted me outside the Court of Appeals gate in Abuja arrested me, accusing me of “defamation” over reports published by SaharaReporters, a standalone legal entity.

“After hours of detention, they let me leave. I have just been informed now that they’ve procured a judge to remand me in prison custody because they heard I am planning to declare my Presidential ambition early next week. I will be bearding out shortly to meet them, I am fully prepared and very convinced that they are irreversibly heading towards self-destruction. #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis,” he also said.","The Nigeria Police Force has again invited human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore over a frivolous petition by a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko.

UEFA Moves Champions League Final From Russia,"

UEFA has moved this season’s Champions League final from Saint Petersburg in Russia to Paris in France following the invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin’s government.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin chaired an extraordinary meeting of the Executive Committee on Friday where it was decided that the Champions League final should be moved away from Saint Petersburg.

The final will now hold at the Stade de France in Paris, as first reported by the New York Times. Paris last hosted the European Cup final in 2006, when Barcelona defeated Arsenal 2-1.

Zelensky added that 316 soldiers have also been wounded in the attack.

He described Russia’s claim that its troops are not targeting civilian areas as “a lie”, saying both military and civilians are being hit.

“They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven,” Zelenskyy said.

“I remain in Ukraine, my family is in Ukraine, my children are in Ukraine. My family is not traitor, they are citizens of Ukraine.

“According to the available intelligence. the enemy marked me as target number 1, my family as target number 2. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.

“They say civilians are not their target but this is another of their lies. In reality, they do not distinguish between areas in which they operate. Our boys and girls — all defenders of Ukraine did not allow the enemy to implement the operational plan of invasion on the first day. Ukrainians show real heroism. The enemy was stopped in most directions.

“To the citizens of the Russian federation that are coming out to protest, we see you. And this means that you have heard us. This means that you have started to believe us. Fight for us, fight against war.”

He also lamented that “everyone” is afraid to fight for them and that the country has been “neglected”.

“Today, I have asked 27 European leaders whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I have asked directly. Everyone is afraid, no one answers,” he said.

“But we are not afraid. We are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our country; we are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk about security guarantees for our country, we are not afraid of talking about neutrality, we are not NATO members at the moment but what guarantees will we get?

“And most importantly, which countries will give us those guarantees?”

As the Russian troops continued their offensive, explosions were reportedly heard in Kyiv, the country’s capital, early on Friday.

Nigeria’s Vision Has Not Been Realised – Buhari,"President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the vision of the founding fathers of Nigeria has not been realised.

According to Buhari, more intellectuals are needed in governance for a better Nigeria.

Buhari stated this at the public presentation of a book titled, “Unfinished Greatness, Envisioning A New Nigeria,” written by the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi held at the NAF Conference Centre Kado Abuja.

Buhari who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, said he has a high regard for Dr Fayemi because of his intellectual works that are helping in building the country.

“The vision of our founding fathers has not been realised,” Buhari said adding that it was the reason the book should be read.

“The book will help in the governance of the country,” Buhari said, adding that Fayemi was his minister and a trail blazer, having transformed the solid mineral industry.

“Fayemi was part of the team that helped bring me to power and he was part of the transition government.

“Sometimes, academics are not feet in governance. And as the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has said, too much analysis can lead to paralysis.

“So, governance should be a combination of intellectuals and people that are experienced in governance. That makes the country move forward. We need a combination of experienced people and the academia who identify the needs of the society.

“Mr President is of the view that the more experience we have, the more people can get it better,” Gambari said.

Also speaking, the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, said people often see politics as a dirty game but added that it is not.

“Politics is not a dirty game,” Ganduje said while encouraging intellectuals to join politics.

“We are witnessing intellectualism in governance and intellectualism in politics. There is no doubt, this is a welcome development.

It is good for intellectuals to take a role in politics because they analise and lead the people because there are always conflicting variables,” Ganduje said of Fayemi.

“In Nigeria, intellectuals are afraid of governance because they see politics as a dirty game. But Politics is not a dirty game. There is a connection between intellectualism and governance,”Ganduje said.

The keynote speaker who is a Senior Programme Staff, South Asia Institute, Prof Adebayo Olukoshi, said Africa has not found the right leadership but added that the people must be determined to have a Singapore, Brazil and become big players in the international system.

“Digging a bit deeper, if we must transform a nation, we must look at dignity. While character can change a nation, it is dignity that transforms a nation. China is a good example,” he said.","President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the vision of the founding fathers of Nigeria has not been realised.

Ayu Urges Buhari To Sign Electoral Bill,"National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senator Iyorchia Ayu has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill so that the nation can have elections which are impossible to rig.

He also said All Progressives Congress (APC) is scared of getting the electoral act amendment bill signed into law because the party is afraid of losing the 2023 general elections.

Ayu spoke in Jos, during the flag off of his party’s “mega campaign rally for Jos North/Bassa federal constituency and Pankshin South State constituency bye-election,” set for this weekend.

The PDP national chairman at the event received a former state chairman of APC, Chief Letep Dabang, and others who decamped to PDP.

Presenting the party flag to the bye-election candidates as well as to the decampees, Ayu charged them to be united and ensure victory for the party on Saturday.

His words, “I am proud of Plateau as the home of PDP. This is the only serious party in the country, all others are contraptions. Under PDP, we saw development and unity but now, there is no development. I want to see the unity of PDP leaders on the Plateau because this is home. If they are not united, if I have a problem, where will I go?

“I want everyone to work together and bring back all our members who were angry and left PDP. Plateau is the home of PDP, we must work together to return to power and save the country. I don’t want Plateau to be in opposition when we win the election at the federal. You must do the right thing, get your PVC, and vote. Our votes will count, that is why the APC doesn’t want electoral reforms. President Buhari must sign the electoral act immediately, that will make elections impossible to rig.”

C/River By-elections: PDP Kicks Over Deployment Of Soldiers,"Ahead of February 26, Ogoja/Yala federal constituency and Akpabuyo state constituency by-elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised the alarm over planned deployment of soldiers for the conduct of the by-elections.

The PDP said the state as an entity has no power to deploy soldiers for elections stressing that it is only the military high command at the defence headquarters that has the right to deploy soldiers for any reason.

PDP state chairman, Venatius Ikem raised the alarm while addressing journalists about rumours making the rounds that the APC government has hatched a plan to deploy soldiers for the election.

Ikem stated that the directive for deployment of soldiers for any critical assignment can only come from the chief of army staff and the political parties concerned will be adequately briefed on their operational order.

He said, “There are legitimate ways you can deploy the army as well as illegal ways to intimidate voters.

“That directive can only come from the Chief of Army Staff and if there are reasons to deploy the army it will be so stated.

“We will also be briefed on the operational order outside which you cannot deploy the army.”

Ikem alleged that it was wrong for the Cross River State governor to have allegedly met with the commander, 13 Brigade, Nigerian Army Akim Barracks to solicit for deployment of soldiers for the by-elections.

ADVERTISEMENT

Ikem stressed that the PDP would do everything humanly possible to legitimately resist any such attempt as the army was not directly involved in elections but for the protection of the country’s territorial integrity.

The PDP stressed that while members of their party are playing by the rules of engagement, the APC government in power is doing the contrary in order to create an atmosphere where there will be a breach of security so that they can use the apparatus of government to harrass and intimidate the PDP in the contest.

Ikem averred that his party would not allow any underhand tactics to undermine an election they are poised to win adding that the PDP has been working vigorously to ensure that victory is achieved.","Ahead of February 26, Ogoja/Yala federal constituency and Akpabuyo state constituency by-elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised the alarm over planned deployment of soldiers for the conduct of the by-elections.

YPA drums support for Atiku’s presidential ambition,"The Young Professionals for Atiku Abubakar, YPA, a political pressure group, has urged Nigerians to support former vice-president Atiku Abubakar to actualise his presidential ambition in 2023.

Dr Ja’afaru Sa’ad, a former gubernatorial aspirant in Kaduna State under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the convener of the movement, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Zaria.

Sa’ad said the group was a coalition of young professionals across the 36 states of the federation and the FCT who believe in the potential of the former vice president to lead the country to greater heights.

He described the agitation for the president to come from the southern part of the country as the “the noise of democracy’’, adding that “we are in democracy and people were free to ventilate their opinion”.

“If you narrowed Nigeria’s democracy down from 1999 to date, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had about three presidents; Olusegun Obasanjo from the Southwest spent eight years.

“Umaru Yar’Adua from North West spent about three years before he died and power automatically shifted to South-South and subsequently PDP lost power to APC.

“The president is now from North West but it was from a different party not the PDP. Therefore, in the whole of this scenario, the north just spent about three years.

“The north had yet to complete its eight-year tenure in line with PDP zoning arrangement,’’ he said.

He said it was imperative for PDP’s presidential flagbearer to come from the north in order for the zone to complete its remaining one-term and the “best candidate for the exalted office is former vice president Abubakar”.

According to Sa’ad, the country is polarised and it is at the verge of total collapse due to the current socio-economic difficulties and security challenges.

“As a group, we believe that Mr Abubakar has the experience and expertise to salvage our country from these multi-dimensional challenges,” he asserted.","The Young Professionals for Atiku Abubakar, YPA, a political pressure group, has urged Nigerians to support former vice-president Atiku Abubakar to actualise his presidential ambition in 2023.

"BREAKING: Police Reinvite Sowore After Illegal Arrest As Buhari’s Minister, Malami, Nwoko Secure Judge To Remand Activist In Prison Custody","Omoyele Sowore, a human rights activist, has been summoned by the Nigeria Police Force over a spurious petition filed by Ned Nwoko, a former member of the House of Representatives.

On Thursday, Sowore was apprehended by a team of armed police officers who had laid siege to the Court of Appeal’s entrance.

He was transported to Guzape’s dissolved Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), also known as Abattoir, where he was held for several hours.

According to a police source, Nigeria’s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and Nwoko, are dissatisfied with the activist’s release.

According to the source, the duo has gotten a judge who will remand Sowore in prison if he accepts today’s invitation.

“Ned and the AGF are unhappy that we released him last night. They have secured a judge to remand in prison custody today,” the source said.

Confirming his invitation on Twitter, Sowore said, “@mBuhari cabal members led by Malami are so scared now, they want to take me before a judge & send me to prison so that I won’t be able to declare for presidency early next week! We are more than ready! #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”

“Earlier yesterday morning a group of well-armed govt sponsored miscreants attacked our contingent, assaulted and stole their phones in the Gudu area of Abuja on our way to the Court of Appeal.

“The case was immediately reported to the police but they did nothing about it. It turns out it was part of a bigger plot as later in the afternoon a group of well-armed policemen accosted me outside the Court of Appeals gate in Abuja arrested me, accusing me of “defamation” over reports published by SaharaReporters, a standalone legal entity.

“After hours of detention, they let me leave. I have just been informed now that they’ve procured a judge to remand me in prison custody because they heard I am planning to declare my Presidential ambition early next week. I will be bearding out shortly to meet them, I am fully prepared and very convinced that they are irreversibly heading towards self-destruction. #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis,” he also said.","On Thursday, Sowore was apprehended by a team of armed police officers who had laid siege to the Court of Appeal’s entrance.

Breaking: Russia incurs more losses as UEFA moves Champions League final to France,"The 2022 Champions League final will be played in Paris after Russia was stripped of the match following the nation’s invasion of Ukraine.

The final of Europe’s most prestigious club competition was due to be played in St Petersburg on 28 May.

Following a meeting on Friday, Uefa confirmed the match would not be held at the Gazprom Arena.

Instead the European football governing body has decided it will be staged at the Stade de France in Paris.

Uefa expressed “thanks and appreciation” to French President Emmanuel Macron for “his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis”.

It added: “Together with the French government, Uefa will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.”

At Friday’s meeting, Uefa also ordered Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams to play their home matches away from the region.

Spartak Moscow are the only Russian team left in European club competition this season, having reached the Europa League last 16.

They will find out their opponents – with Scottish Premiership champions Rangers one of the clubs they could be paired with – when the draw takes place at 11:00 GMT.

Spartak, along with other Russian and Ukrainian sides, will “be required to play their home matches at neutral venues until further notice”, said Uefa.

Russia and Ukraine are both scheduled to play 2022 men’s World Cup play-off matches in March, with world governing body Fifa saying on Thursday it was monitoring the situation in the region.

Russia are due to host Poland in Moscow on 24 March, while Ukraine travel to Scotland on the same day.

In the statement announcing its decisions, Uefa did not mention its relationship with Russian state-run gas giant Gazprom.

Gazprom is one of Uefa’s major sponsors in a long-term deal worth about £30m, as well as holding the naming rights for St Petersburg’s 68,000-capacity stadium.

Gazprom is also the main sponsor of German club Schalke, who announced on Thursday the logo of the company would be removed from the club’s shirts.

Alex Phillips, a former Uefa executive and now an independent adviser to Fifa, said Uefa will have to “seriously revise who they accept sponsorships with”.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “When I was at Uefa I was head of compliance and I wrote a series of regulations recommending that this sort of relationship should be, at the very least, out in the open and regulated.”","The 2022 Champions League final will be played in Paris after Russia was stripped of the match following the nation’s invasion of Ukraine.

Those who swear by Holy Book must not abuse public office – Buhari,"President Muhammadu Buhari has advised leaders who took the oath of office and swore with the Holy Book to be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God.

Speaking during a courtesy visit to the palace of the Emir of Lafia, retired Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad 1, the president, in company with the host governor, Abdullahi A. Sule, reaffirmed that he has no intention whatsoever to stay beyond the constitutionally recognised two terms of office as leader of Nigeria.

”The traditional ruler is on a terminal appointment. Constitutionally, we (elected public office holders) are not. I cannot go beyond two terms and I have sworn by the Holy Quran that I will uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

”Politics apart, whenever we are made to swear by the Holy Quran, we have to be very careful. We must make sure that we do not abuse the trust God has given us as leaders.

”I have seen former governors here and I am looking forward to also becoming a former president,” he said.

The president thanked the people of Nasarawa state for the rousing welcome accorded him, expressing delight that the North-Central state was wearing a new look since his last visit in 2019.

He congratulated the immediate past governor and lawmaker representing Nasarawa South Senatorial District, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura and his successor, Governor Sule for the laudable initiatives and accomplishments in the state.

Welcoming the president to the over 200-year old palace, the Emir of Lafia thanked him for ending the problem of insufficient power supply to the state with the provision of 330kVA sub-station.

The Emir, who is also the chairman or Nasarawa state council of chiefs, told the president that the provision of the electricity plant ”has taken out 80 percent of our problem.”

”Our people have never had it so good. Our people are back to their normal life as entrepreneurs, ” he said, adding that the federal government’s projects that were ”standing as ghosts” in the state in the past, have now become a reality.

The retired jurist listed the newly inaugurated CBN Building in Lafia, the Federal Secretariat, UBEC Smart School and completed ecological projects as some of those federal projects in the state under the Buhari administration.

On arrival in the capital for his two-day state visit to Nasarawa, President Buhari inaugurated the Lafia Airport, Vocational and Skills Acquisition Centre, Modern Bus Terminal and the Shinge-Barkini Abdullahi-Kilema road, executed by the state government.

He also inaugurated CBN Lafia Branch building and a 330kva Akurba Transmission Substation executed by the federal government through the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) to boost power supply in the state and its environs.

The minister added that with the official inauguration by the president, Nasarawa state has now become a centre of electricity distribution.","President Muhammadu Buhari has advised leaders who took the oath of office and swore with the Holy Book to be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God.

"As Russia-Ukraine crisis worsens: FG prepares special flights to evacuate Nigerians, students – Blueprint Newspapers Limited","The federal government is planning a special flight operation to evacuate Nigerians from Ukraine amid the escalating crisis in the country;Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this in Abuja Thursday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation Thursday in Ukraine with explosions heard soon after across the country and its foreign minister warning a “full-scale invasion” was underway.

The hostility is a fallout of intense diplomacy and the imposition of western sanctions on Russia which failed to deter Putin, who had reportedly moved between 150,000 and 200,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine.

FG’s worry

Worried by the Russian strike at Ukraine, the Nigerian government said it would fashion out ways to move its nationals out of the country.

“The Federal Government of Nigeria has received with surprise, reports of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” a statement signed by Ministry spokesperson Francisca Omayuli said.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been reassured by the Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine of the safety of Nigerians in that country and measures being undertaken to keep them safe and facilitate the evacuation of those who wish to leave.

“The Federal Government wishes to assure the families with loved ones in Ukraine that as soon as the airports in the country are opened, it would assist in facilitating the evacuation of Nigerians who are willing to leave.

“In the meantime, the Nigerian Mission has confirmed that military action by the Russians has been confined to military installations.”

Be responsible for your safety, citizens advised

In a related development, the Nigerian embassy in Ukraine has urged citizens in the country to remain calm but very vigilant and be responsible for their security and safety in the country.

A statement issued by Nigerian Embassy in Kiev, urged Nigerian students seeking temporary relocation to seek proper clearance and guarantee before relocating.

The embassy explained that any Nigerian, who considers the crisis as emotionally disturbing, should temporarily relocate to anywhere they consider safe by “private arrangement.”

It advised all Nigerians to ensure they validate all their resident documents for ease of return to the country when desired.

“The attention of the Embassy has been drawn to the declaration of state of emergency and Martial law on the entire territory of Ukraine except the Donestsk and Luhansk regions by the government of Ukraine, effective from midnight of February 23, 2022, for a period of 30 days, as well as the latest development on the Ukraine-Russia crises.

“In view of the development, the embassy urges Nigerian Nationals resident in Ukraine to remain calm but very vigilant and be responsible for their security and safety.

“The embassy wishes to add that should any Nigerian National consider the situation as emotionally disturbing, such National may temporarily relocate to anywhere considered safe by private arrangement. They should, however, ensure that they do all the needful to validate all their resident documents for ease of return to the country when desired.

“Students seeking temporary relocation are enjoined to seek proper clearance and guarantee form from their respective institutions during this period.

“For those who are still considering it appropriate to remain in the country, be rest assured that the embassy remains open for its consular duties and responsibilities at all times.”

Reps intervene

Earlier in its invention, the House of Representatives had called for the immediate evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine.

The lawmakers feared many Nigerian students in Ukraine could be caught in the crossfire.

The call came Thursday following motion of Urgent Importance to evacuate Nigerian students in Ukraine, presented by Ahmed Munir, who solicited for urgent intervention of the House.

Also in its resolution, the House mandated the majority leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa and chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Buba Yakub, to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Nigeria Intelligence Agency (NIA) with the view to airlifting the Students back to Nigeria without further delay.



The House also mandated the Majority Leader and his team to travel to Ukraine Friday and come back with as many Nigerian students as possible by Monday.



The House in addition, noted that if nothing was achieved with the arrangement, then it would work with the local airline, Air Peace, to see how the students can be evacuated in a way and manner that would be devoid of any further delay.



The committees on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora has been mandated in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ascertain the exact figures of Nigerians affected by this conflict and put in place comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and mechanism.

Specifically, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila agreed with a lawmaker, Leke Abejide, to interact with the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema to evacuate Nigerians from Ukraine by Monday, February 28.

However, some lawmakers feared it may be too late, saying the evacuation ought to have been done long ago.

Ohanaeze urges action

Meanwhile, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide Thursday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently rescue indigenes of the country trapped in Ukraine.

A statement by the President General of the group, Okechukwu Isiguzoro said Nigerians in Ukraine who are mainly students and those in medical tourism were stranded.

The statement reads: “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, as a result of the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine and subsequent Russian military invasion in Ukraine, to facilitate the evacuation exercise of over 3,500 Nigerians mainly Igbo, who are stranded in Ukraine.

“From the reports available to us through the Ohanaeze Ukraine chapter and Nigerian community leadership, there are lots of Nigerians, especially students, medical tourists, and others who are trapped, stranded in Ukraine and deserve to be evacuated from the crisis-ridden country before the war escalates.

“The federal government should take responsibility for their safety and security and evacuate them immediately.

“Nigerian Government should establish contact with her Foreign Mission and Embassy in Kyiv to facilitate the process of making it easier for the evacuation exercise of Nigerians from Ukraine back to Nigeria, as attempts to reach out to the Nigeria Diaspora Commission office is yet to yield adequate results, as Federal Government invention is needed now.”

Poland, Hungary, Slovakia

And in what looks like a succour, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are making preparations to receive Ukranians fleeing Ukraine as a result of Russia’s attack on their country, Reuters reported.

While Poland is setting up reception points on its border, Hungary and Slovakia are planning to send troops to manage the likely influx.

The countries on the European Union’s eastern flank were all part of the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact and are now members of NATO. Among them, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania all share land borders with Ukraine.

Earlier on Thursday, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine amidst calls for dialogue and diplomacy. According to Reuters, it is the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two confirming the West’s worst fears. It prompted fears of a massive flood of refugees fleeing Ukraine, a nation of 44 million people.

Poland called for the “fiercest possible sanctions” against Russia and the Czech foreign minister called the invasion a “barbaric act of aggression”.

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, despite good ties with Russia, condemned Moscow’s actions. He said Hungary would prepare humanitarian aid for Ukraine and was ready to receive refugees.

Ukrainians started trickling into Poland, with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.

Polish hospitals were preparing beds for wounded Ukrainians, the health ministry said, and the Polish army raised the level of preparedness of some units.

“We will do everything to ensure that every person who enters the territory of Poland has access to healthcare, including hospitalisation,” the ministry said.

Poland said it would set up reception points for refugees on its borders, PAP news agency quoted Polish Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Pawel Szefernaker as saying.

Small groups of people also fled into Hungary on Thursday through the Beregsurany crossing, some coming from as far as Kyiv, a Reuters witness said. Some arrived by car, but many pedestrians were also hauling their suitcases across.

Slovakia also expressed its willingness to help refugees.

“We can predict with near certainty that Russian aggression will drive out many Ukrainian women and men from their country,” Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger said. “Please let’s have compassion and understanding for them.”

Slovakia will send up to 1,500 troops to its border with Ukraine, where additional crossings will be set up, said Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad. Hungary has also said it will send troops to its border to help process refugees.

A Polish government spokesman said Polish diplomatic missions in Ukraine would remain open “as long as possible” but the foreign ministry urged all Polish citizens to leave Ukraine.

Hungary also said its embassy in Kyiv remained open. The Czech Republic closed its diplomatic mission, though its consulate in the west Ukrainian city of Lviv remained open.

Germany offered humanitarian help to countries bordering Ukraine.

German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and one million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine.

Public transportation halted

The Slovak railway halted services to Ukraine, and budget airline Wizz temporarily suspended all flights in and out of Ukraine. Czech Airlines also suspended flights as Ukraine closed its airspace.

Slovak news agency TASR reported there were waiting times of two to four hours for passenger cars at two main border crossings, while another crossing saw traffic flowing smoothly.

There are around 260,000 Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, and tens of thousands working in Slovakia and Hungary, which has a large ethnic minority of around 140,000 living in Ukraine just beyond the border.

Romania is ready to grant humanitarian aid if needed, President Klaus Iohannis said Thursday.

He also called for the “consistent consolidation” of NATO’s eastern flank.

Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said his country was preparing to evacuate by land more than 4,000 ethnic Bulgarians from Ukraine and was ready to host other Ukrainian refugees.","The federal government is planning a special flight operation to evacuate Nigerians from Ukraine amid the escalating crisis in the country;Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this in Abuja Thursday.

"Finally, President Buhari Signs Electoral Act Amendment Bill Into Law","President Muhammadu Buhari has finally signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law.

The President assented to the bill at past midday on Friday at a brief ceremony held at the Council Chamber of the Aso Villa in Abuja.

The President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, witnessed the signing of the bill.

Members of the President’s cabinet in attendance included his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, among others.

This comes barely a week to the expiration of the window the President has to take a decision on the proposed legislation, as required by the Nigerian Constitution.

Having received the bill from the National Assembly on January 31, various stakeholders including political actors and civil society groups had awaited its signing into law by the Nigerian leader.

Amid an outcry over the delay in signing the bill into law, sources had indicated that President Buhari was billed to give his assent on Wednesday.

But the signing of the bill failed to take place as scheduled and was rescheduled to Friday, although sources said the President would honour the new date.

Failed Attempts

Previous attempts to amend the nation’s electoral laws were unsuccessful during the 8th National Assembly led by former Senate President Bukola Saraki and former Speaker Yakubu Dogara.

But lawmakers in the 9th National Assembly successfully amended the act, although they also had an initial setback.

President Buhari had withheld his assent to the bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political players as part of the reasons for his decision.

He later gave some conditions to give his assent – an action that prompted the lawmakers to re-work the bill, leading to the emergence of two versions in the Senate and House of Representatives chambers.

The House had re-amended the bill to include the direct and indirect primary options while the Senate re-adjusted it to include the direct, indirect, and consensus modes of selecting political parties’ candidates.

Both chambers later passed the harmonised version on January 25 – the final agreed version of the amendment to Clause 84 which included the direct, indirect, and consensus primary modes.

The harmonised version was received by President Buhari a week later, as confirmed by his Senior Special Assistant on NASS Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare.","President Muhammadu Buhari has finally signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law.

At Least 137 ‘Heroes’ Killed As Invading Russian Forces Press Deep Into Ukraine,"Invading Russian forces pressed deep into Ukraine as deadly battles reached the outskirts of Kyiv, with explosions heard in the capital early Friday that the besieged government described as “horrific rocket strikes”.

The blasts in Kyiv set off a second day of violence after Russian President Vladimir Putin defied Western warnings to unleash a full-scale ground invasion and air assault that quickly claimed dozens of lives and displaced at least 100,000 people.

The United States and its allies responded with a barrage of sanctions, but the Russian forces appeared intent Friday on pressing home their advantage after a string of key strategic victories on day one.

“Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba posted on Twitter after explosions were heard in the capital before dawn.

“Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.”

READ ALSO: EU Leaders Agree ‘Maximum Impact’ Sanctions On Russia

At least 137 “heroes” were killed during the first day of fighting, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday, as he called up conscripts and reservists nationwide to fight in a general mobilisation.

Zelensky said there was now a “new iron curtain” between Russia and the rest of the world, like in the Cold War, adding in a later speech his nation had been “left alone”.

“Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone.”

And while the United States moved to impose sanctions on Russian elites and banks, it stressed that American forces would not head to eastern Europe to fight in Ukraine.

NATO said it had activated “defence plans” for allied countries.

But NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said there was no plan to send alliance forces into Ukraine.

‘War on Europe’

Among the highest-profile strategic developments on Thursday, Ukraine said Russian forces had seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant — prompting concern from international nuclear watchdogs.

Zelensky called the attack on Chernobyl “a declaration of war on all of Europe” while 18 people were killed at a military base near the Black Sea port of Odessa in the deadliest single strike reported by Kyiv.

Witnesses also told AFP that Russian paratroopers wrested control of the strategic Gostomel airfield, on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv.

“The helicopters came in and then the battles started. They were firing machine guns, grenade launchers,” resident Sergiy Storozhuk said.

Russian ground forces had initially moved into Ukraine from the north, south, and east, forcing many Ukrainians to flee their homes as the sound of bombing reverberated.

Moscow’s defence ministry said Thursday its forces had “successfully completed” their objectives for the day, earlier claiming to have destroyed over 70 Ukrainian military targets, including 11 airfields.

Western intelligence confirmed Moscow had established “complete air superiority” over Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces said they had killed “around 50 Russian occupiers” while repulsing an attack on a town on the frontline with Moscow-backed rebels, which could not immediately be confirmed by AFP.

Ukraine also said a military plane with 14 people on board crashed south of Kyiv with officials still determining how many people died, while a transport plane crashed in Russia killing the crew.

Olena Kurilo was among 20 people wounded by flying shards of glass following a blast in the eastern Ukrainian town of Chuguiv.

“Never, under any conditions will I submit to Putin. It is better to die,” the 52-year-old teacher said, her face covered in bandages.

In the Ukrainian village of Starognativka near the frontline where separatists have faced off against Kyiv’s forces, official Vladimir Vesyelkin said missiles had rained down since Friday morning, and power was out.

“They are trying to wipe the village off the face of the earth,” he said.

Sanctions

Weeks of diplomacy failed to deter Putin, who massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders in what the West said was Europe’s biggest military build-up since World War II.

Western allies had initially imposed some sanctions on Russia in an en effort to deter Putin, then followed through on Thursday with vows to try and heavily punish Russia economically.

US President Joe Biden announced export controls against Russia to cut off more than half of the country’s high-tech imports, alongside sanctions on Russian elites he called “corrupt billionaires”, and banks.

He will meet Friday with fellow Nato leaders in an extraordinary virtual summit to discuss the security situation in and around Ukraine later.

The EU moved to impose “massive” sanctions on Russia’s energy and finance sectors, while French President Emmanuel Macron called Putin to “demand immediate halt” to the offensive — but said the door must be kept open for dialogue.

The fighting spooked global financial markets, with stocks plunging and oil prices soaring past $100.

IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said the unrest carried “significant economic risk” for the world, but Putin insisted he did not seek to undermine the global economic system.

Demonstrations across Europe

In a televised address, the Russian president justified the assault as a defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics in eastern Ukraine.

The Kremlin earlier said the leaders of the two separatist territories had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv after Putin recognised their independence on Monday.

A conflict between the separatists and government forces has dragged on since 2014, killing more than 14,000 people on both sides.

Russia has also long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining NATO and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.

In the Baltics, Lithuania declared a national emergency. Latvia, Lithuania, and Czech Republic, also stopped issuing visas to Russians.

Demonstrators took to the streets of European capitals to condemn the Kremlin but a small anti-war protest in Moscow was quickly halted by police, with over 1,700 people detained at rallies across Russia.

The first Ukrainian refugees have begun to trickle into Hungary, Romania, and Poland while the UN said 100,000 had been displaced by the fighting.

“Anyone who can is fleeing,” said Krisztian Szavla, one of the first refugees who arrived Thursday in Hungary from Ukraine’s western Transcarpathia region.","Invading Russian forces pressed deep into Ukraine as deadly battles reached the outskirts of Kyiv, with explosions heard in the capital early Friday that the besieged government described as “horrific rocket strikes”.

EU Leaders Agree ‘Maximum Impact’ Sanctions On Russia,"EU leaders wrapped up an emergency summit early Friday with an agreement to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine by imposing “severe” sanctions targeting its financial, energy and transport sectors.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told a media conference afterwards they “will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite”.

The summit started late Thursday, the day Russia started blasting military targets and sending tanks and paratroopers into its pro-Western neighbour Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the gathering by videolink, telling European presidents and prime ministers that “he does not know if he will be able to speak with us another time,” Luxembourg’s leader Xavier Bettel recounted as he left.

Von der Leyen said the packet of sanctions — the second adopted this week by the EU — is “targeting 70 per cent of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies including the field of defence”.

She did not go into details, but a list drawn up by her commission, seen by AFP, proposed adding two Russian private banks — Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie — to entities sanctioned by the EU.

It also called for Russians to be prohibited from putting deposits over 100,000 euros ($112,000) in EU banks or from purchasing euro-denominated securities.

Von der Leyen said the measures “will increase Russia’s borrowing costs, raise inflation and gradually erode Russia’s industrial base”.

Energy sector targets of the sanctions included an export ban on equipment and technology Russia needs to upgrade its oil refineries.

An export ban on aircraft and plane parts to Russian airlines would also “degrade a key sector of Russia’s economy and the country’s connectivity,” von der Leyen said.

“The fourth point is we are limiting Russia’s access to crucial technology — we will hit Russia’s access to important technologies it needs to build a prosperous future such as semiconductors or cutting edge technologies,” she said.

“And finally, on visas, diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union.”

SWIFT rift

The latest sanctions will come into effect once legal texts are drawn up that are then formally approved by member states’ foreign ministers and published in the EU’s official journal.

That was expected to happen as early as Friday or Saturday.

The leaders also discussed how to ramp up political, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine.

While EU agreement on the outline of the sanctions was rapid, there were clear divisions over the option of kicking Russia out of the SWIFT network that the world’s banks use to securely send messages in order to carry out transactions.

Zelensky has urged the West to use that lever, which has already been implemented to devastating effect against Iran’s banking sector.

But US President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington as the EU summit started, said: “It is always an option but right now that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.”

That assessment was borne out by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who suggested as he arrived for the summit that SWIFT and other measures should be kept “for a situation where it might be necessary, for other things”.

Other EU leaders, though, chafed at that stance.

“Talk is cheap… we have to be united around massive sanctions, severe sanctions,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.

Latvia’s prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, said: “SWIFT, I think it’s the very right direction, I think we should go in that direction”, but only if other jurisdictions outside Europe also adopted that tactic.

AFP","European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told a media conference afterwards they “will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite”.
The summit started late Thursday, the day Russia started blasting military targets and sending tanks and paratroopers into its pro-Western neighbour Ukraine.

US: Three Minneapolis Ex-Police Officers Guilty of Violating George Floyd’s Rights,"Three former Minneapolis police officers were found guilty by a federal jury on Thursday of depriving George Floyd of his civil rights by failing to give aid to the handcuffed Black man pinned beneath a colleague’s knee.

The jury also found that the conduct of officers Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38, during the arrest on May 25, 2020, caused Floyd’s death, a finding that can affect the severity of their sentence.

RelatedStories No Content Available

It is a rare instance of police officers being held criminally responsible for a colleague’s excessive force. All three men were convicted of denying Floyd’s constitutional right to medical care while in police custody.

Thao and Kueng were also convicted on a charge of denying Floyd’s right to not face excessive force by failing to stop their colleague Derek Chauvin from kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted last year in a state court of Floyd’s murder.

Thao, Kueng and Lane will remain free on bail pending their sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled. Prosecutors have not yet said what sentence they will request, but the men may face years in prison.

“This is just accountability,” Philonise Floyd told reporters after the verdict was read. “It could never be justice because I can never get my brother back.”

The verdict marked a second victory this week for prosecutors in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, coming just two days after a jury in Georgia found three white men guilty of federal hate crimes in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who was gunned down while running through a mostly white neighborhood.

“That’s historic for our country, because oftentimes officers kill Black and brown men and women, and we get little to no consequences,” said Brandon Williams, George Floyd’s nephew. “A lot of times we don’t even get charges, let alone convictions.”

KILLING SPARKED PROTESTS

Federal prosecutors argued in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul that the men knew from their training and from “basic human decency” that they had a duty to help Floyd as he begged for his life before falling limp beneath Chauvin’s knee.

Floyd’s killing sparked protests in cities around the world against police brutality and racism.

It also led lawmakers to propose such measures as restricting chokeholds, banning “no-knock warrants,” and legislating to curtail the U.S. Supreme Court doctrine known “qualified immunity” that limits lawsuits over police use of excessive force.

Those proposals were included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives last year. Philonise Floyd on Thursday again urged lawmakers to pass the measure that has stalled in the Senate, where Democrats are unlikely to get the necessary Republican votes.

Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison last year after a state murder trial. Although race was not part of the state or federal charges, Chauvin’s conviction was seen as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans. In December, Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charge of violating Floyd’s rights.

Under Chauvin’s plea agreement, federal prosecutors will seek a 25-year sentence, concurrent with his state prison sentence. His three former colleagues are also due to stand trial in Minneapolis in June on state charges of aiding and abetting Floyd’s murder.

BYSTANDER VIDEO

Widely seen cellphone video showed Thao stood steps away from Floyd, rebuffing the demands by horrified onlookers that Chauvin get off Floyd’s neck. Kueng and Lane were to Chauvin’s right, pinning down Floyd’s buttocks and legs.

All three testified in their own defense. Each acknowledged they knew they had a duty of care to people in their custody. But they and their lawyers told jurors they did not realize at the time that Floyd was in dire need of medical aid or that Chauvin’s use of force was excessive.

Prosecutors repeatedly played videos showing Floyd’s distress was plain to bystanders, including children and an off-duty firefighter, who shouted that Floyd was passing out and begging the police to check his pulse.

The three defendants all described deferring to the authority of Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene with 19 years at the Minneapolis Police Department. read more

Kueng and Lane, who first handcuffed Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill in a nearby store, also noted they were rookies only a few days out of training, which lasted more than a year. Thao had been on the force for eight years.

Medical experts have testified that Floyd almost certainly would have survived the arrest if he had been rolled onto his side once the officers restrained him, as the officers acknowledged they had been taught to do.","RelatedStories No Content AvailableIt is a rare instance of police officers being held criminally responsible for a colleague’s excessive force.

World Leaders Fine-Tune Sanctions Meant to Punish Russia,"Twenty million dollars in U.N. humanitarian funds for Ukraine. A raft of new, stronger sanctions against Russia from Japan, Australia, Taiwan and others. And a cascade of condemnation from the highest levels.

As Russian bombs and troops pounded Ukraine during the invasion’s first full day, world leaders on Friday began to fine-tune a response meant to punish the Russian economy and its leaders, including President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

While there’s an acute awareness that a military intervention isn’t possible, for now, the strength, unity and speed of the financial sanctions — with the striking exception of China, a strong Russian supporter — signal a growing global determination to make Moscow reconsider its attack.

“Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday while announcing new punitive measures that included freezing the visas and assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals, and the suspension of shipments of semiconductors and other restricted goods to Russian military-linked organizations.

“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an extremely grave development that affects the international order, not only for Europe but also for Asia,” Kishida said.

Countries in Asia and the Pacific have joined the United States, the 27-nation European Union and others in the West in piling on punitive measures against Russian banks and leading companies. The nations have also set up export controls aimed at starving Russia’s industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products.

The moves follow Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin’s forces conducted airstrikes on cities and military bases, and his troops and tanks rolled into the nation from three sides. Ukraine’s government pleaded for help as civilians fled. Scores of Ukrainians, civilians and service members alike, were killed.

“An unthinkable number of innocent lives could be lost because of Russia’s decision,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. She announced targeted travel bans against Russian officials and other measures.

At the United Nations, officials set aside $20 million to boost U.N. humanitarian operations in Ukraine. Separately, the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces. Moscow, however, is certain to veto it.

U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the $20 million from the U.N.’s Central Emergency Response Fund will support emergency operations along the contact line in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk and in other areas of the country, and will “help with health care, shelter, food, and water and sanitation to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict.”

The West and its allies have shown no inclination to send troops into Ukraine — a non-member of NATO — and risk a wider war on the continent. But NATO reinforced its member states in Eastern Europe as a precaution against an attack on them, too.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, meanwhile, extended to 200 nautical miles the airspace it considers risky, and warned of “the threat of missile launches to and from Ukraine.”

Protests by Ukrainians and their supporters were held Friday in Taiwan, Mongolia, Australia and elsewhere. Public buildings, sports stadiums and landmarks in the Australian city of Melbourne were illuminated in Ukraine’s national colors of blue and yellow.

Japan’s new sanctions follow an earlier set of measures that include the suspension of distributing and issuing new Russian government bonds in Japan — a move aimed at cutting funding for Russia’s military — a trade ban with two Ukrainian separatist regions and the freezing of their assets and visas.

Japan, which has long sought to regain control of Russian-held northern islands seized at the end of World War II, took a milder stance toward Moscow during Russia’s 2014 Crimea annexation. Tokyo’s response to the current invasion has been considered tougher and faster, something that may be linked to a deep worry in Tokyo over China’s increasingly assertive military actions in the region.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his nation will join international sanctions, but won’t consider unilateral sanctions.

South Korea’s comparative caution is likely because its economy is heavily dependent on international trade. It also worries that strained ties with Moscow could undermine efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis. Russia is South Korea’s 10th largest trading partner, and Moscow is a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council and maintains friendly ties with North Korea.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi phoned Putin late Thursday and appealed for an “immediate cessation of violence,” his office said in a statement.

India’s permanent U.N. representative pushed for “urgent de-escalation” through “sustained and focused diplomacy,” but stopped short of either condemning Russia or acknowledging Ukraine’s sovereignty.

The cautious statement reflects India’s delicate position. It relies heavily on Russia, a historic partner, for military equipment but has sought to strengthen ties with the West over the years.

Taiwan announced Friday that it would join in economic sanctions against Russia, although it did not specify what type of measures those would be. Sanctions could potentially be focused on export control of semiconductor chips, local media reported. Taiwan is the dominant manufacturer of such chips, a critical component used in technologies from cars to laptops to cellphones.

While most nations in Asia rallied to support Ukraine, China has continued to denounce sanctions against Russia and blamed the United States and its allies for provoking Moscow. Beijing, worried about U.S. power in Asia, has increasingly aligned its foreign policy with Russia to challenge the West.

“At a time when Australia, together with the United Kingdom, together with the United States and Europe and Japan, are acting to cut off Russia, the Chinese government is following through on easing trade restrictions with Russia and that is simply unacceptable,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday.

“You don’t go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they’re invading another country,” he added, referring to a report in The South China Morning Post that China had announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports.

In Tokyo, Ukraine’s top diplomat for Japan urged China to join international efforts to stop the Russian invasion.

“We would very much welcome that China will exercise its connection with Russia and talk to Putin and explain to him it is inappropriate in the 21st century to do this massacre in Europe,” Ambassador Sergiy Korsunsky told reporters.","A raft of new, stronger sanctions against Russia from Japan, Australia, Taiwan and others.

President Zelenskyy Pleads for Help as Russian Troops Advance on Ukraine’s Capital Kyiv,"Missiles pounded the Ukrainian capital on Friday as Russian forces pressed their advance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough.

Air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv amid unconfirmed reports that a Russian plane had been shot down and crashed into a building a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion that has shocked the world.

A senior Ukrainian official said Russian forces would enter areas just outside the capital, Kyiv, later on Friday and that Ukrainian troops were defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered.

An estimated 100,000 people fled as explosions and gunfire rocked major cities. Dozens have been reported killed. Russian troops seized the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant north of Kyiv as they advanced on the city from Belarus.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials say Russia aims to capture Kyiv and topple the government, which Putin regards as a puppet of the United States.

Zelenskiy said he understood Russian troops were coming for him but vowed to stay in Kyiv.

“(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,” Zelenskiy said in a video message. “My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”

“I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine.”

Russia launched its invasion by land, air and sea on Thursday following a declaration of war by Putin, in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Putin says Russia is carrying out “a special military operation” to stop the Ukrainian government from committing genocide against its own people – an accusation the West calls baseless. He also says Ukraine is an illegitimate state whose lands historically belong to Russia.

Ukrainian forces downed an enemy aircraft over Kyiv early on Friday, which then crashed into a residential building and set it ablaze, said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister.

It was unclear whether the aircraft was manned or whether it could be a missile. Kyiv municipal authorities said at least eight people were injured when the object crashed into an apartment block.

“Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany.”

Authorities said intense fighting was under way in the city of Sumy in the northeast.

A border post in the southeastern Zaporizhzhya region had been hit by missiles, causing deaths and injuries among border guards, and air raid sirens sounded over the city of Lviv in the west of the country.

Asked if he was worried about Zelenskiy’s safety, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS: “To the best of my knowledge, President Zelenskiy remains in Ukraine at his post, and of course we’re concerned for the safety of all of our friends in Ukraine – government officials and others.”

SANCTIONS BUILD

A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join the NATO military alliance and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

The United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Australia and the EU unveiled more sanctions on Moscow on top of penalties earlier this week, including a move by Germany to halt an $11 billion gas pipeline from Russia.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described the bloc’s measures as “the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented”.

China came under pressure over its refusal to call Russia’s assault an invasion.

U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters at the White House, said: “Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.” He declined to comment directly on China’s position.

The U.N. Security Council will vote on Friday on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s invasion and require Moscow’s immediate withdrawal. However, Moscow can veto the measure, and it was unclear how China would vote.

Russia is one of the world’s biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world.

Oil prices soared as much as $2 per barrel on Friday as markets brace for the impact of trade sanctions on major crude exporter Russia.

U.S. wheat futures hit their highest in nearly 14 years, corn hovered near an eight-month peak and soybeans rebounded on fears of grain supply disruptions from the key Black Sea region.

Airlines were also facing disruptions, with Japan Airlines cancelling its Thursday evening flight to Moscow and Britain closing its airspace to Russian carriers.

"In First Major Post-PIA Deal, Seplat Acquires Mobil Producing Oil Assets in Nigeria","Seplat Energy on Thursday announced its acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), in a deal seen as the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari in August last year. The deal is however subject to Ministerial Consent and other required regulatory approvals.

Seplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian energy company listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), was expected to announce the agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil, with the completion of the transaction subject to ministerial consent and other required regulatory approvals.

The statement from the company showed that Seplat Energy Offshore Limited, a wholly owned Nigerian subsidiary of Seplat Energy Plc, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU for a purchase price of $1,283 million plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.

The transaction, according to statement, encompasses the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria, which it said is an established, high-quality operation with a highly skilled local operating team and a track record of safe operations.

The transaction, it said, would create one of the largest independent energy companies on both the NGX and LSE and bolster Seplat Energy’s ability to drive increased growth, profitability and overall stakeholder prosperity. The deal would deliver 186 per cent increase in production from 51,000 bpd to 146,000 bpd or 170 per cent increase in 2P liquids reserves, from 241 MMbbl to 650 MMbbl.

In addition, it was expected to deliver a 14 per cent increase in 2P gas reserves from 1,501 Bscf to 1,712 Bscf, plus significant undeveloped gas potential of 2,910 Bscf (JV: 7,275 Bscf)

Furthermore, it was expected to increase by 89 per cent, the total 2P reserves from 499 MMboe to 945 MMboe and includes offshore fields with dedicated, MPNU-operated export routes offering enhanced security and reliability.

In the oil industry, 2P reserves are the total of proven and probable reserves while probable reserves are less likely to be recovered than proven reserves.

Being the first transaction to be announced since the Nigerian government’s recently ratified PIA, the company stated that the deal would support Nigeria’s energy transition and objectives of the new Act.

Seplat Energy said it was fully committed to working with the Nigerian government to bring the strategically important national assets fully into Nigerian ownership alongside the national oil company, NNPC.

In addition, it noted that the development of the gas resources would support the government’s objective to achieve a pragmatic, progressive and just energy transition for Nigeria.

The transaction agreement also includes potential additional contingent consideration of up to $300 million in total, payable over the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, and contingent upon average Brent crude oil prices exceeding $70 per barrel and subject to MPNU’s average working interest production exceeding 60 kboepd (JV: 150 kboepd).

The deal primarily comprises a 40 per cent operating ownership of four oil mining leases (OMLs 67, 68, 70, 104) and associated infrastructure with NNPC being owner of the rest 60 per cent.

It includes the Qua Iboe Terminal, one of Nigeria’s largest export facilities as well as a 51 per cent interest in Bonny River Terminal and Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plants at EAP and Oso.

However, the contract does not include ExxonMobil’s deep-water assets in Nigeria.

According to statement, the cash consideration payable under the transaction will be funded through a combination of existing cash resources and credit facilities of Seplat Energy, and a new $550 million senior term loan facility and $275 million junior offtake facility.

Also included is a global financing syndicate comprising Nigerian and international banks, as well as commodity trading companies, while contingent payments, if materialised on Brent oil price annual average above $70/bbl, will be funded through share of net cash flows from operations.

Under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Seplat Energy will pay a deposit of $128 million, which will be applied towards the purchase price on closing.

“If the transaction does not proceed, the deposit will be repaid to Seplat Energy where the agreement is terminated by Seplat Energy in certain circumstances.

“The Transaction does not require the approval of Seplat Energy’s shareholders and will not result in any changes to its Board. The Company currently expects the Transaction to close in H2 2022,” it stated.

Commenting on the deal, Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. Bryant Orjiako, said: “This is a transformational acquisition for Seplat Energy that strengthens our partnership with the national oil company, the NNPC, and consummates the spirit of the newly enacted PIA.

“As a significantly larger business, with a stronger resource base and greatly enhanced capabilities, we will be better positioned to provide sustainable energy solutions that drive growth and profitability for the benefit of all our stakeholders, particularly our host communities and the wider Nigerian economy.

“We fully support the aims of the federal government’s “Decade of Gas”, and this acquisition will accelerate our development of Nigeria’s gas resources to help achieve a just transition for our rapidly growing country.”

Also, Chief Executive Officer of the company, Roger Brown, said: “This transaction underpins Seplat Energy’s drive to be a leader in the growth of the indigenous independent energy sector in Nigeria.

“The acquisition is a perfect fit with our strategy to build a sustainable business and deliver energy transition in Nigeria. Our financial strength has enabled us to attract high quality local and international capital providers to fund this transaction without diluting our existing shareholders and reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation.

“We are determined to drive our growth through the extensive low-cost and low-risk production opportunities it delivers in the near term, whilst also developing longer-term opportunities to monetise our significant gas resources through domestic and export opportunities.

“This is a win-win for both companies. Together, we will strengthen our focus on profitability and cash generation to reinvest in Nigeria’s energy development.

“MPNU’s employees and contractors have a strong reputation for safety and operational excellence, and I look forward to welcoming them to the Seplat Energy family,” he stated.

For months, Mobil’s officials have been holding talks with several Nigerian companies to gauge their interest in the fields, followed with the opening of a “data room” – which provided technical information on the fields, such as seismic and production details – in Nigeria.

The discussions focused on a number of onshore fields ExxonMobil shares in joint ventures with Nigerian state oil firm, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), including Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 67, 68, 70 and 104.

Nonetheless, three other aspirants to the same office, namely, Tanko Al makura, Saliu Mustapha and Sunny Moni Dafe, had immediately rejected the “purported” adoption of Adamu by the president.

In addition to the disavowal by other contestants, a group of concerned APC North-West stakeholders, has insisted that those aspiring to the exalted seat of APC chairmanship should be allowed to test their popularity and therefore, the contest should be thrown open.

This, notwithstanding, the leadership of the ruling party, has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses to be held on March 12, 2022.

Different sources confided in THISDAY on Thursday that the inroads made by Senator Adamu in reconciling aggrieved members of the party that attracted him to Buhari as a likely choice for party’s chairmanship.

But some governors, especially, those from north central were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, insisting that since the national chairman, has been zoned to the geo-political, they should be allowed to decide who picks the position.

Besides, the purported endorsement of Adamu has also not gone down well with other aspirants and governors, as they claimed that he was not among the aspirants, as his name only popped up last week before President Buhari travelled to Brussels, Germany.

Before his departure, the president was said to have asked for the names of all the aspirants and his name was added.

Governor Sule of Nasarawa State and his counterpart in Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdurazak, were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, but backed Al-Makura.

Another governor from the zone, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, THISDAY was told, also rejected the purported adoption of Adamu.

Mustapha, on his part, told THISDAY on Thursday that against the media speculations, the President has not adopted Adamu, describing it as “a media game.”

According to him, “My governor (Governor Abdulrazaq of Kwara) told me that the matter of who becomes the next national chairman of our party has not been discussed.”

Mustapha, who maintained that the matter was not discussed at the APC governors’ meeting with the president, told THISDAY that the president only approved the zoning of offices as presented to him by the APC-elected governors.

“At the meeting, no name was mentioned. It was only the approval of the zoning of offices that was presented and the president only approved the zoning and asked the governors to go about it diligently to ensure peace.

“The President Buhari that I know will not like to do things secretly. This is a media game by those concerned. I don’t know what they want to achieve.”

Another aspirant, Monidafe, questioned the aid adoption of Adamu, claiming that if it wastrue, why has the president not officially announced it?

Senator Al-Makura, in a statement by Segun Tomo, the Director, New Media, Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO), also denied that Adamu has been adopted as the national chairman of APC.

“The attention of the Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO) has been drawn to wide speculations and propaganda making the rounds in some news outlets that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed the candidacy of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu as the next Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

“While we would have ordinarily ignored the widespread rumours, we have been inundated with calls and apprehension of Sen. Umaru Tanko Al-Makura’s supporters across the country. Therefore, we decided to respond, and set the records straight.

“Information at our disposal indicate that what transpired at the meeting of the governors with the president was the ratification of the new convention date and agreement on the zoning formula.

“On the issue of who becomes chairman, the president asked that consultations continue to produce a credible and widely accepted choice as consensus candidate.

“One does not need a soothsayer to know that Al-Makura fits the bill. Across the length and breadth of the country, Sen. Al-Makura is seen as a bridge-builder, a leader imbued with a calm temperament, renowned with an impeccable mobilization skills and political sagacity that ensured he defeated the then entrenched Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State.”

Concerned APC North-West Stakeholders forum, has insisted that those aspiring for the chairmanship of the party should be allowed to test their popularity, openly.

National Convener of the group, Alhaji Sani Abubakar, in a statement argued that the call was necessitated by the purported move to impose Senator Abdullahi Adamu as chairman of the party.

The group expressed convern that some of the party’s governors from the North West geopolitical zone were already dropping the name of President Muhammadu Buhari purely to promote the candidacy of Senator Abdullahi Adamu.

The group cautioned some members of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) to thread with caution so as not to destroy the APC, saying there would be consequences for any act that causes problems for the party.

“The stakeholders have become aware that members of the PGF from the north-west, who championed this errant position are acting out their own greed and personal agenda, which is that each of them is hopeful of emerging the running mate to an eventual APC presidential candidate from the south.

“It is most unfortunate that people, who currently (individually) hold the mandate for the wellbeing of millions of people as state governors are unable to subjugate their selfish interest for national interest, party loyalty and the long-term stability of Nigeria’s democracy.

“It is tragic how these individuals overheated the polity simply out of desperation to occupy a position that is not zoned to their areas. These persons from the north-west looking for the position of vice president that, going by our history as a nation, it is well known that the best the region could get after 2023 is the national chairmanship position of the party.

“All those pushing for a candidate from the north central to be made a consensus chairman of the party, which has earlier been zoned to the north west, are traitors and seem to only be interested in rubbishing Mr. President’s legacies in office by appending his name as mark of approval to their plans.”

The All Progressives Congress (APC), has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses slated for March 12, 2022.

National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe disclosed this in a statement issueed on Thursday in Abuja.

He said, “The chairmen of the committees are all members of the CECPC, while secretaries are selected from amongst the deputy governors from their respective geo-political zones.

“Meetings of zonal stakeholders hold on Saturday, 26 February, 2022 at the respective geo-political zones.” Akpanudoedehe disclosed.

For the North-Central zone, the Governor of Niger SState, Abubakar Bello was appointed chairman, while Prof. Sonni Tyoden will serve as the secretary.

The party appointed Senator Yusuf Yusuf as the chairman for the North-east Zone, while Mr. Manasseh Jatau, will serve as the secretary.

The APC appointed Mr. David Lyon as the chairman for the South-south, while Prof. Ivara Esu, will serve as the secretary.

Akpanudoedehe said Senator Abba Ali would serve as the committee chairman for the Northwest zone, while Hadiza Balarabe is the secretary.

Hon. Akinremi Olaide was appointed as the chairman for the South-west zone and Dr. Kadiri Hamzat is the secretary.

Ukraine: FG assures Nigerians of safe evacuation,"Putin ready for talks with Ukraine delegation in Minsk

Russian forces enter Kyiv, ready to overthrow president

NATO holds emergency summit over crisis

The Federal Government yesterday assured Nigerians living in Ukraine of their safe evacuation amidst Russia’s multiple attacks on Ukraine.

Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, gave the assurance while speaking with newsmen in Abuja.

Onyeama said the Federal Government was making arrangements for a special flight operation to evacuate her citizens from Ukraine in view of the escalating tension between that country and Russia.

He added that the Nigerian Embassy in Kiev had been contacted and told to make arrangements for those wishing to return home from other areas including Donestk and Luhensk.

The minister assured Nigerians that the ministry was following the event since it began and assured of the Federal Government’s readiness to speedily ensure the safe evacuation of Nigerians, particularly the students in Ukraine.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Russian military has started attacking military installations in multiple fronts in spite of Russian President Vladimir Putin assurance not to attack Ukrainian citizens.

While Kiev is under bombardment, her citizens are seeking shelter in metro underground stations.

Tens of thousands of people cross the border out of Ukraine, while the European Union expressed readiness to assist with the sum of 1.7 billion euros in economic aid to Ukraine.

Turkish government has also expressed readiness to send humanitarian aid to its Ukrainain counterpart.

‘Putin ‘ready’ for talks with Ukraine’

The Kremlin (Russian government) said yesterday that President Vladimir Putin was ready to send a delegation to Belarus for talks with Ukraine.

This was Russian forces closed in on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on the second day of Moscow’s invasion.

Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said yesterday that the Russian leader was “ready” to send a high-level delegation “for talks with a Ukrainian delegation” to Belarusian capital Minsk, which has previously hosted rounds of peace talks over the Ukraine crisis.

He said Putin’s ally, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, told him that he would “create the conditions” for such a summit.

Russia has thousands of troops stationed in Belarus, and Ukraine said it was being attacked from several sides – including from Belarus.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had repeatedly called for talks with the Russian leader during a weeks-long diplomatic push in which Western countries tried to deter Putin from launching an attack.

Zelenskyy had made an initial proposal of talks in a speech addressed to Putin late on Wednesday, shortly before the Russian invasion.

He said at the time: “Ukraine’s security is linked to the security of its neighbours. That is why today we have to talk about security in the whole of Europe. That is our main goal – peace in Ukraine and the security of our citizens.

“For this, we are ready to talk to everyone, including you. In different formats and in any place.”

As Russian troops closed in on Kyiv yesterday, Zelenskyy issued a new statement urging talks.

“I would like to address the President of the Russian Federation once again. Fighting is going on all over Ukraine. Let’s sit down at the negotiating table to stop the deaths of people,” he said.

Kyiv has floated the idea that Ukraine could promise to take a neutral status on NATO membership in order to end the violence.

Putin urges Ukraine army to remove govt

Later yesterday, Putin called on the Ukrainian army to overthrow the government whose leaders he described as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”.

Putin also accused “Ukrainian nationalists” of deploying heavy weapons in residential areas of major cities to provoke the Russian military, without providing evidence; a claim that could fuel fears Moscow is creating pretexts for justifying civilian casualties.

In a televised address, he urged the Ukrainian military to “take power in your own hands”.

“It seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” he said, referring to Zelenskyy’s government.

NATO holds emergency summit over crisis

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said yesterday that U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts have agreed to send parts of the organisation’s response force to help protect allies in the east over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking after chairing a NATO meeting, Stoltenberg said the leaders decided to send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployed spearhead unit.

He did not say how many troops would be deployed, but confirmed that the move would involve land, sea and air power.

The NRF can number up to 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg said that NATO would not be deploying the entire force.

Parts of a force known in NATO jargon as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which is currently led by France, will also be sent.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday released a video of himself and his senior aides in Kyiv to reassure the nation as Russian troops were closing in on the capital.

In the video Zelenskyy recorded in the street outside the presidential office, he said he and his top officials were staying in the capital.

“Our troops are here, citizens are here,” Zelenskyy said, adding that “All of us are here protecting the independence of our country. And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, Glory to Ukraine, Glory to Heroes.”

Russian troops bore down on Ukraine’s capital yesterday with gunfire and explosions resonating ever closer to the government quarter.

In the fog of war, it was unclear how much of Ukraine remained under Ukrainian control and how much or little Russian forces had seized.","Putin ready for talks with Ukraine delegation in MinskRussian forces enter Kyiv, ready to overthrow presidentNATO holds emergency summit over crisisThe Federal Government yesterday assured Nigerians living in Ukraine of their safe evacuation amidst Russia’s multiple attacks on Ukraine.

"Varsities shutdown looms as SSANU, NASU, NAAT threaten strike","A total shutdown of universities in the country is looming following the decision of three university – based unions to issue a fresh strike notice to the Federal Government over non-implementation of signed agreements.

The three university- based unions’ threat is coming barely 13 days after the Academic Staff Union of Universities declared a one month warning strike which has crippled academic activities in universities nationwide.

The university – based unions include: the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT), Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU).

The JAC of NASU and SSANU said at its meeting on 24 February 2022, that it had reviewed the status of the Memorandum of Understanding reached with the Federal Government following its industrial action of January and February 2021.

While the university technologists have given the Federal Government between February 28 and March 14 to implement its demands, the Joint Action Committee comprising SSANU and NASU have put its members on “red alert” over a possible strike.

The JAC of NASU and SSANU said it could no longer guarantee industrial peace in the university system.

But Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige said the unions had not officially communicated their intention to embark on strike to his ministry.

He directed the unions to get in touch with their employers – the Federal Ministry of Education on the level of implementation of the MoU.

President of NAAT, Ibeji Nwokoma, told reporters at a briefing on Friday in Abuja that each branch of the union would hold congresses between March 15 and 16 to discuss the response of the federal government to the demands of the union.

He added that a two-week warning strike would be declared by NAAT on March 17, 2022 at the expiration of the two week grace (February 28 – March 14) without concrete feedback from the government.

He said: “If the government fails between February 28 and March 14 to respond to these issues, we will call a Congress from March 15 – 16. By March 17, the National Executive Council will meet and declare a warning strike.

“The warning strike will be for two weeks after which NAAT will embark on an indefinite strike until our demands are met.

“In the light of the above, failure on the part of the government to address all the issues raised, NAAT may be compelled to embark on an industrial action which shall be total and indefinite.

“NAAT therefore call on all well-meaning Nigerians (traditional rulers, religious leaders, members of the National Assembly, etc) to prevail on the government to avert the looming strike action.”

He lamented the failure of the Federal Government to fully implement signed agreements.

The NAAT President added: “It is pertinent to know that more than twelve years after signing of agreement with NAAT concerning emolument, motivation and welfare of our members, many components of the agreement are either not implemented or partly implemented.

In a statement jointly signed by the General Secretary, NASU, Prince Peters Adeyemi and National President of SSANU, Mohammed Ibrahim, the JAC said: “Having waited one whole year for the consummation of the Memorandum of Understanding and despite all peaceful entreaties, we wish to notify all stakeholders in the Nigerian universities and Inter-University Centres; and indeed all Nigerians of the possible breakdown of industrial peace in the university system borne out of disrespect for Collective Bargaining Agreements reached with NASU and SSANU by Government.

“Given the situation of things as of today (yesterday) and the agitation of our members, we can no longer guarantee industrial peace in our university system.

“With this release, we place all Nigerians on red alert of the possibility of an industrial action by the non-teaching staff unions of NASU and SSANU, as we can no longer watch as agreements freely entered into by the Federal Government with the unions are not respected.”","The university – based unions include: the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT), Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU).

"MTN, Mafab pay for 5G Spectrum, says NCC","The Nigerian Communications Commission has confirmed full payments of 273.6 million dollars each by MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications Ltd for 5G Spectrum license.

The commission, in a statement signed by its Director of Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, said the two companies met the February 24 deadline set by the commission for them to pay for the license.

The statement reads:”Provisional winners of the 3.5 Gigahertz (GHz) spectrum licence, MTN Communications Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, have made their full payment of $273.6 million each for the 5G Spectrum license to the Nigerian Communications Commission.

“The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, officially confirmed the payment status today, February 24, 2022, just as the deadline set for the two winners of the spectrum auction elapsed.

“As part of the auction process emplaced by the Commission in the Information Memorandum (IM), three companies, namely MTN Nigeria, Mafab Communications Ltd and Airtel Networks Ltd submitted bids with an initial bid deposit (IBD) of $19.74 million, representing 10 per cent of the Reserve Price of the 3.5GHz Spectrum by the close of the Bid submission date of November 29, 2021.

“Following the successful auction on December 13, 2021 and the emergence of MTN and Mafab as winners, they were required to pay the balance of the bid amount of $253.86 million on or before February 24, 2022.

“However, aside the $273.6 million payment, MTN paid additional $15.9 million, being the bidding sum it offered at the assignment state of the spectrum auction, making it clinch its preferred Lot 1 (3500-3600 Megahertz-MHz) in the 3.5Ghz spectrum; while, Mafab Communications, which bided lower at the assignment stage, consequentially settled with Lot 2 (3700-3800Mhz) at no extra cost.

“Confirming the payments by the two licensees, Danbatta said: “I wish to officially announce that NCC has received and confirmed payments from MTN and Mafab for their acquisition of 1 slot of 100Mhz each in the 3.5Ghz spectrum auction, which was successfully conducted by the Commission on December 13, 2021. They both met the deadline of February 24, 2022 as set by the Commission”.

“Arising from this and on behalf of the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the Board and Management of the NCC, I wish to congratulate the MTN and Mafab for this feat, as we look forward to accomplishing other deployment timelines in the 5G deployment roadmap, as articulated in the National Policy on 5G Networks for Nigeria’s Digital Economy”, Danbatta stated.

“For meeting the payment deadline, Danbatta has commended the two companies for their commitment to 5G deployment drive through their private investments, which he said, was a demonstration of the licensees’ belief in the sound regulatory environment in the Nigerian telecommunications sector.

“Danbatta also expressed appreciation to the Federal Government for its support and commitment to the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria which, he said, will bring substantial network improvements, including higher connection speed, mobility and capacity, as well as low-latency capabilities to communications services in Nigeria.

“The Commission published a Public Notice on its decision to award two lots of 100MHz Time Division Duplex (TDD) available in the 3.5 GHz band through an auction process, to support the delivery of ubiquitous broadband services for the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria.

“Subsequently, an Information Memorandum (IM) was issued on November 10, 2021, in which Bid Applications for the available spectrum lots were invited. By the deadline for receipt of applications on November 29, 2021, the Commission received applications from three licensed telecommunications companies, namely: Airtel Networks Limited, Mafab Communications Limited, and MTN Communications Nigeria Plc.

“The Auction held successfully on Monday, December 13, 2021 at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja with the three bidders competing for the available two lots in which the Commission adopted the Ascending Clock Auction format that ended after Round 11, and proceeded to the Assignment Stage.

“In the auction, MTN and Mafab emerged provisional licence winners and arising from this, the winning bid price for the auction was put at $273.6 million for each lot of 100 MHz TDD. The Provisional licence winners were then directed to pay the Winning Bid Price less the Intention-to-Bid Deposit, by February 24, 2022.

“Industry stakeholders and observers have commended the Commission for the auction process, described as efficient, fair, well-organised and transparent; as well as designed to deliver the ideal outcome which saw the strongest bidders emerge as winners, raising a substantial amount for the Federal Government and setting the stage for the next phase in Nigeria’s 5G roadmap.”","The Nigerian Communications Commission has confirmed full payments of 273.6 million dollars each by MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications Ltd for 5G Spectrum license.

Addressing the traditional ruler, the governor said: “We have come to see the level of damage and assure you that the state government has increased surveillance and safety of the people of Uromi.

“By the grace of God, these people will be arrested and brought to book. The people should go about their normal businesses.”

The royal father, in his response, said: “The situation was like a war zone, and it lasted for over two hours and the robbers took control of the area and killed my subjects.”

The entourage also visited the Nigeria Police Force, Uromi Command, which was also attacked by the robbers to demobilise the officers before the robbery, while the team also visited the hospital where the injured victims were being treated.","Edo Police Command last night disclosed that N34, 510,000 was recovered from fleeing armed robbers who Thursday evening, attacked four commercial banks at Uromi, headquarters of Esan Northeast Local Government Area of the state.

‘Sons’ of Benson Idahosa to hold Mega-Conference in September – Nigerian Observer,"Share Facebook

BENIN CITY – Members of the All Nations For Christ Bible Institute International Alumni Association have announced plans to hold a mega conference that will bring together men and women who were raised by the late Archbishop.

The conference tagged ‘Sons of Benson Idahosa Conference (SOBIC) is scheduled to hold in September later this year and will be a convergence of every man and woman whose life has been impacted directly or indirectly by the Archbishop Benson Idahosa of blessed memory.

This was made known at the inauguration of the Alumni by the President of the Church of God Mission International Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa on Sunday in Benin City.

Vice Chairman of the Alumni association Bishop Dr. Robertson Akwazi while speaking at the occasion disclosed that the Man Archbishop Benson Idahosa’s life and time is one that will continue to serve as a point of reference in the Church, not just in Nigeria but the world all over.

Bishop Akwazi also known as AA Global said, it would be unimaginable just how many great men and women of God today will show up for the event which coincides with the week of his birthday.

“We decided that since we are the Idahosas that you can see not only in Nigeria, but in Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, South Africa and the World all over, now is the time to cause his voice to be heard once again throughout the Land. He said the Archbishop Dr Margaret Idahosa has given the alumni a fresh mandate, to raise men, women and leaders who will impact not just on the Church but the society for good. ”

Apostle Joshua Olaoye in his remarks, highlighted the fact that the Bible Institute had birthed well over 15,000 leaders spread across the globe, stating that the Alumni Association was one that has come in good time. The essence of its validation by the Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa he said was one that cannot be overestimated.

Another member of the AA Governing Body, Bishop Chris Otaigbe said ”The Sons of Idahosa Conference is kick-starting a movement and it will be a yearly event. The conference will shake the Nation for good. Amongst the Sons of Benson Idahosa, we have Papa Ayo Oritsejafor, our immediate past PFN Chairman, Pa Felix Omobude, Archbishop Nicolas Duncan Williams, we are bringing everybody together to cause his voice to be heard once again as we converge. If the man Benson Idahosa were here with us , a lot of the manifestations in our midst today would not have happened. ”

”The Provost of the School Dr. Habib Usman, added saying ” I believe in historical legacies, and Idahosa being a foundation Apostle, he set the platform for everyone to run through. And in terms of the school graduating 15,00 students, that is not a mean number. And saying this covers all seven continents of the world, is not an assumption, its a reality, because we have seen students from Australia, from India, currently we have students from America studying with us. We have seen students from all 32 countries in Africa come to study with us here in Benin city.

“So the impact that All Nations has made in the sphere of Christianity, not just Pentecostalism, is not something that can be scribbled down with an academic pen. It is beyond our explanation. Those of us in our 40s and 50s will recall the proverbial saying ‘As poor as a church rat’, Those were the days when the Church was designated to be meant for poor people. With Archbishop Benson Idahosa coming into the center stage of Christianity, that expression no longer exists. It is noteworthy here to state that the introduction of prosperity doctrine to the church was necessitated by the fact that Nigeria just came out from civil war because we know that Nigeria was in civil war when the church started. And Papa Idahosa was able to tell the church that we can come out of that poverty, and the rest is what you and I are able to attest to.

The Sons of Benson Idahosa Conference (SOBIC) 2022 is scheduled to come up in September later this year. And is expected to attract participants from within and outside Nigeria. Guest Speakers expected at the three-day event include Archbishop Ayo Oritsejafor, Archbishop Duncan Williams from Ghana, Archbishop David Oyedepo, and a host of great men and women of God spread across the globe.

"Better stay in Nigeria to study than face war, racism overseas – Shehu Sani","Immediate past Senator representing the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, has advised Nigerians to settle for studying in government-owned universities, rather than face war and racism in their quest for education abroad.

He stated via his Twitter page that students “dying to study abroad” should instead “stay at home” and cope with incessant strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities.

“Those who are dying to study abroad, stay at home and get into federal or state university. It’s better to hustle with ASUU than war and racism,” he tweeted.

Sani’s tweet comes amid the reports of Nigerian students stranded in Ukraine which is facing an ongoing war with Russia.

Reacting to the tweet, one Twitter user, @YarKafanchan, pointed at the state of insecurity in the Senator’s own state. He wrote, “Have you forgotten the students in Kaduna State who have spent and are still spending months in the dens of armed terrorists?”

“This is a country where hundreds of teenage schoolgirls get kidnapped and spend month with their captors and it’s not major news. Nigerians are safer among racists,” @EugenehoCortez tweeted.

@OgSadik stated that, “You should know a nation has failed its youth if the choice is between staying here and facing war/racism.”

“The fact that Nigerians are willing to risk war and racism shows how much politicians like you have failed,” @originalBNV wrote.

China vows cooperation with North Korea under ‘new situation’ – Report,"North Korea, officially known as the DPRK, carried out an unprecedented seven weapon tests in January — including its most powerful missile since 2017 — with negotiations with the United States at a standstill.

It paused testing during the Beijing Winter Olympics, with analysts saying the decision could have been made out of deference to China.

Beijing is Pyongyang’s most important ally and economic benefactor, their relationship was forged in the bloodshed of the Korean War in the 1950s.

In his message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xi said Beijing was ready to “develop the China-DPRK relations of friendship and cooperation” under a “new situation”, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.

KCNA did not further elaborate on what the “new situation” entailed.

North Korea is reeling economically from a self-imposed coronavirus blockade, and restarted cross-border trade with Beijing last month.

China accounts for more than 90 per cent of the isolated country’s bilateral trade.

Pyongyang is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

But regardless, it has warned it could abandon its self-imposed moratorium and resume testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons.

Some experts have warned that with the eyes of the world focussed on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, North Korea might take the opportunity to test-fire long-range missiles.","North Korea, officially known as the DPRK, carried out an unprecedented seven weapon tests in January — including its most powerful missile since 2017 — with negotiations with the United States at a standstill.

"Imo Bye-Election: Early voting begins, as APC, PDP battle soul of Ngor Okpala",",

The Bye-Election to fill the vacant Ngor Okpala State Constituency seat at the Imo State House of Assembly began as scheduled at 8 am across the constituency.

The early voting is credited to the early arrival of election materials by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

As of 7 am Wazobia Politics observed the arrival of materials across most polling units with INEC staff setting up polling booths for the most anticipated election of the year in Imo State.

The bye-election is being viewed as a litmus test of the popularity of incumbent Governor Hope Uzodimma and his Party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) following his ouster of former Governor Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by a landmark judgement of the Supreme Court on the 14th of January 2020. The PDP has since then accused the Governor of being unpopular.

The main contestants in today’s Bye-Election are Amajirionwu Blyden Okanni of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Emeka Nwachukwu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Christopher Nwaiwu of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).

Reports from the camp of the PDP as widely reported in the Constituency suggest that the fractured relationship and leadership tussle between chieftains of the PDP in Imo State, former Governor Emeka Ihedioha and Sen. Samuel Nnaemeka Anyanwu, the current National Secretary of the PDP may take a toll on its performance at today’s election.

Unconfirmed reports indicate that a faction of the PDP has endorsed and thrown its weight behind the candidate of APGA Christopher Nwaiwu. The outcome of the endorsement will be seen at the end of today’s election.",",The Bye-Election to fill the vacant Ngor Okpala State Constituency seat at the Imo State House of Assembly began as scheduled at 8 am across the constituency.

Gov Emmanuel inspects legacy projects,".

…Says timely completion non-negotiable

All major projects undertaken by the Akwa Ibom State Government by the present administration will be completed on time and commissioned, Governor Udom Emmanuel has assured.

The Governor who stated while speaking to newsmen at the project sites when he undertook an inspection tour of ongoing projects in the state on Friday said, he was satisfied with the quality and pace of work on the IBB Flood Control and the Ekpene Ukpa Cable-Stayed Bridge Projects.

Speaking at the IBB Flood Control Project site, the governor described the drainage project as one of its kind in the whole country, in terms of length and quality, maintaining that with the number of communities and lives the project stands to impact positively, it can pass for a legacy project.

“I’m impressed with the standard, the pace and then the quality of delivery. We had some expectations but as we can see here, they have gone beyond the standards we set for them.

“Then in terms of deliverables, they have also exceeded my expectations. I just want to reassure you that this will be completely finished before we leave office if we can go close to 90% as of today”, he said.

“Everything you’re seeing here right now apart from passing through the ring road III and then taking it to the outfall station. I think it’s almost done.

“We were also a bit concerned about how to take water completely out of the Secretariat, but with what I’m seeing here right now, I think that has been solved.”

He described the drainage project as more complicated and fund consuming.

“This is more complicated and more expensive than normal road construction. If you check what we’ve buried under the ground, it goes beyond normal politics to get this done. It takes a heart of love for the people to do this.”

The Governor thanked members of the communities that construction works have had to pass through, regretting inconveniences they may have encountered and appreciated the contractors for working day and night to take advantage of the dry season to move at the pace they are moving.

Similarly, at the Ekpene Ukpa Cable Bridge, on the Etinan-Onna road under construction, the governor said the quality of work at the bridge could speak for itself, assuring that the road will divert traffic at East-West road and take through Etinan to Uyo and then to Calabar-Itu, so people can continue their business activities without getting into Eket city.

Reiterating the commitment of his administration to ensure a dualized thoroughfare for anyone coming into the state from Ikot Oku Ikono junction up to the Atlantic ocean in Ibeno, the governor said, on good authority, that Julius Berger has just 5km to link Etinan junction, while CCECC is working hard to complete Etinan junction to Eket city, with just a few finishing touches to be done between Eket and Ibeno.

“Though these are federal roads, we can’t continue to allow our people to suffer, so even with our lean resources we do these roads and other infrastructural development projects, hoping that infrastructure will enhance economic activities, which will, in turn, boost the revenue and economic base of the state”, he added.

The Commissioner, Ministry of Environment and Solid Minerals, Sir Charles Udoh, supervising the IBB Flood Control Project said the project traverses 17 communities and 3 local government areas with 8.4Km main drains and 1.6km concrete tributary drains, intended to address issues of flooding in the adjourning areas of Uyo metropolis.

The Managing Director of Wizchino Engineering Limited, Mr Jack Zou who received and conducted Governor Emmanuel round the bridge, appreciated the state government for consistent funding of the project despite lean resources and assured that the bridge was constructed with the best engineering standards.","…Says timely completion non-negotiableAll major projects undertaken by the Akwa Ibom State Government by the present administration will be completed on time and commissioned, Governor Udom Emmanuel has assured.

"Controversy, tension over Zamfara deputy Governor’s impeachment","There is serious tension and controversy over the impeachment of former Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau by the State House of Assembly.

The impeachment followed allegation of financial misapproriation and failure to report promptly to the office since Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).

DAILY POST gathered that the State lawmakers had earlier summoned the embattled former deputy Governor to defend himself over the allegations but he refused to appear.

Instead, he rushed to court to stop the impeachment process.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been accusing Governor Matawalle of being responsible for the impeachment, but the Governor through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Hon. Zailani Bappa denied the claim, saying that the Governor cannot dictate to the State House of Assembly on its activities.

The PDP had stated that after extensive review of the impeachment, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau still remains intact as the Deputy Governor of the State.

However, this medium authoritatively reports that since the political crisis started between the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition PDP in the State, activities of the PDP have been moving on the lowest ebb, as all the leaders of the party have shifted their base from the State.

According to the party’s legal Adviser in the State, Barrister Bashir Abubakar Masama, it was the tension that forced them out of the State.

With less than one year to the 2023 general elections, the party has not made any arrangement to coordinate its supporters.

Reacting swiftly over the impeachment of the deputy Governor, the State legal Adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Barrister Bashir Abubakar Masama had also described the impeachment as illegal.

He explained that the State House of Assembly has no constitutional power to go on with the impeachment process since the case was still in the court.

He pointed out that the court had earlier asked everyone to maintain the status quo.

Also, in a press statement signed by the principal private secretary to the former Deputy Governor, Mr. Aminu Umar, he said since the deputy Governor refused to defect to APC with the Governor last year, the monthly allocation of N30 million naira to his office had been stopped.

“This is a legal battle that must be won for the cause of justice because we have hope in the judiciary.

“Both the House of Assembly and the 7 man judicial panel did not give the deputy Governor a fair hearing at all.

“We were all disappointed by the ugly trend since the House has said that no court could stop the impeachment of the deputy Governor which means the lawmakers had concluded on impeaching him without fair trial,” he said.","There is serious tension and controversy over the impeachment of former Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau by the State House of Assembly.

Russia-Ukraine crisis: What Poland said about stopping Nigerians from entering their country – Oby Ezekwesili,"Nigeria’s former Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili has said that she has gotten answers to reports that Poland is not allowing Nigerians fleeing Ukraine to enter their country.

War broke out in Ukraine on Thursday as the country mounts resistance to Russian soldiers’ invasion of major cities on the order of President Vladimir Putin.

Nigerians and nationals of other countries are now entering Poland and other neighbouring nations for safety.

However, the Nigerian Government on Thursday expressed concern over Poland‘s refusal to allow Nigerians fleeing Ukraine into the country.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, raised the concern on behalf of the government during a meeting with envoys of European Union countries over the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

And Dr Ezekwesili also shared her worries over the issue but added that the Polish government said that Nigerians are allowed to enter their country and stay for only 15 days.

A communiqué drawn from the meeting was signed by the Chairman of the Council, former Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, and the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu.

The communique read in part: “The Council after an in-depth deliberation of the current security challenges decided that to address the increasing security crisis in the state, advice that traditional rulers of various communities and President’s-General, as well as religious leader and all the stakeholders to ensure that the youth imbibe the right values in order avoid destructive vices like violence and drug abuse.”

"Russian-Ukraine war: I’m prepared to fight, sacrifice my life – Klitschko","Retired Ukrainian boxer, Vitali Klitschko has announced plans and preparation to fight for his country against Russia following the attack sanctioned by President Vladimir Putin.

Klitschko, who is the mayor of the capital city Kyiv, spoke during an interview with ITV.

He pledged to lay his life for his country as he joined the army in fighting the Russian troops.

When Klitschko was asked if he would join forces with the Ukrainians to fight the Russians, he said it was an obligation for himself.

“I don’t have another choice. I have to do that… I will be fighting.

“I believe. I believe in Ukraine, I believe in my country and I believe in my people,” Klitschko said.

Recall that Putin had declared war on Ukraine and warned the United States and allies in the west not to interfere, else they will face severe consequences.","Retired Ukrainian boxer, Vitali Klitschko has announced plans and preparation to fight for his country against Russia following the attack sanctioned by President Vladimir Putin.

W/Cup qualifer: Poland to boycott Russia match over invasion of Ukraine,"Poland will refuse to play their forthcoming World Cup play-offs with Russia in March following the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

The winners of the game, which was due to be played on March 25, would face Sweden or Czech Republic four days later for a place in the finals in Qatar in November.

The Polish FA has also offered to host all Ukraine home matches while Ukraine are unable to play in their own country. Ukraine are due to play Scotland in their World Cup play-off at Hampden Park on March 24, and the winner will play either Wales or Austria in Cardiff or Vienna on March 28.

A Polish FA spokesman has told Sky Sports News: “No more words, it’s time to act. Due to the escalation of the aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine, the Polish national team does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia.

“This is the only right decision. We are in talks with the Swedish and Czech federations to bring forward a common position to FIFA.”

A FIFA spokesperson told Sky Sports News they are monitoring the situation and an update about the game would be communicated in due course.

Poland’s top scorer Robert Lewandowski tweeted: “It is the right decision! I can’t imagine playing a match with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening.”

It comes a day after Thomas Tuchel said he understands criticism directed towards Chelsea in response to the ongoing Russian invasion.

After Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine on Tuesday, Labour MP Chris Bryant told the House of Commons Chelsea owner and Russian-Israeli billionaire Roman Abramovich should have his assets seized, questioned whether he should be allowed to operate a football club himself, and quoted a leaked government document suggesting he should not be allowed to be based in the UK.

Ahead of Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, Tuchel told reporters the situation in Ukraine, and the potential consequences was “clouding” his squad’s thoughts and defended their desire to focus on football as the conflict escalated.

He said: “We shouldn’t pretend this is not an issue. The situation for everyone here is horrible. Nobody expected this, it’s pretty unreal. It’s clouding our minds and our excitement towards the final. It brings huge uncertainty, much more to all people in the moment more involved than us. We send our best wishes and regards to them, obviously.

‘We cannot fully free ourselves from it’

“Still there are so many uncertainties around the situation of our club, in the UK with scenarios like this, that it makes no sense if I comment on it. We’re aware of it, we haven’t got so much insight or inside information than you might think, and in the very end, I think it’s also the right from the team and staff to be not political, to focus on sports. Not because we are hiding, but the situation is clear, it’s horrible, no doubt about it.

“I’d love to take my right not to comment on it until there is a decision made. It’s distracting us, it’s worrying us, to a certain degree I can understand it, I can understand the critical opinions towards the club and us who represent it. We cannot fully free ourselves from it.

“But maybe people can understand me as the coach, and players as players, we don’t have the insight what is going on and how much the owner is involved in all this – we don’t feel responsible for what’s going on, it’s horrible and there can’t be a doubt about it, the war in Europe is unthinkable for me for a long period of time.

“Let’s wait, the impact is clear, and the discussions have an impact, but let’s be a bit more patient and understand what the measurements will be and then maybe we’ll deal with it.”

Players, fans and football clubs will be free to protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, without fear of punishment from the FA, Premier League or EFL – so long as those displays are not offensive or overtly political.

As the governing body, it’s the FA who has jurisdiction in these matters, and there are clear kit and advertising regulations that prohibit the use of threatening, abusive, indecent, insulting, discriminatory, political or religious messages.

But there is a widespread feeling among officials displays of support for Ukraine should not be judged in this light.

It is not an offence to display a nation’s flag on shirts or inside a stadium – and Sky Sports News has been told many clubs in the UK are considering adopting the Ukraine flag in some capacity during this weekend’s matches, in a show of solidarity.

The FA considers issues such as this on a case-by-case basis and given its support for initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, punishing messages of support for Ukraine’s people would seem at odds with the organisation’s overall ethos.

The FA took “a common-sense approach” back in the summer of 2020 when it became clear large numbers of professional players wanted to take a knee in a show of unity against racial inequality, following the killing of George Floyd in America.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the time said the players “deserved applause” for the stance they took.

Similarly, football authorities are not now expected to punish players or clubs who speak out on the situation in Eastern Europe.

Russia-Ukraine conflict: NATO activates force for ‘first time’ in history,"The NATO Response Force (NRF) has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

This is the first time the Response Force will be activated since it was formed in 2002 at the Prague summit.

All 30 members of NATO must agree to activate the force, which they had earlier agreed on Thursday.

The NATO Response Force, which consists of about 40,000 troops, is a highly ready and technologically advanced multinational force made up of land, air, maritime and Special Operations Forces (SOF) components that the Alliance can deploy quickly, wherever needed.

The activation of the response troops does not mean that any US or NATO troops will go into Ukraine, which is not a member.

US President Joe Biden has been clear that US troops are deploying to Eastern Europe to help bolster NATO countries nervous about Russia’s aggressive actions, and they will not be fighting in Ukraine.

“We have activated NATO’s defense plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces,” NATO heads of state and government said in a joint statement released Friday after the alliance held a virtual summit.

“We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance. We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defense across the Alliance, now and in the future.”

The Supreme Allied Commander of NATO Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of the NRF, called the force’s activation a “historic moment” according to a statement.

“They represent a flexible, combat-credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing their inherent agility,” Wolters said. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.”

In a message released Friday morning, Zelensky thanked NATO for its support but urged the alliance to do more, lamenting the fact that Ukraine was left to fend for itself.","The NATO Response Force (NRF) has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Edo bank robbery: Speaker blames lack of intelligence by security agencies,"Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Marcus Onobun, has blamed Thursday’s armed robbery incident at Uromi, Esan Northeast Local Government Area of the state on lack of intelligence by security agencies and the porous nature of the ancient town.

Onobun, an Esan man, yesterday, while speaking on a national television, which was monitored in Benin, condemned the armed robbery, which was carried out by no fewer than 20 gunmen who operated for over two hours. The robbers attacked four commercial banks and carted away huge sum of money. Seven persons including two policemen lost their lives while many persons were injured.

The Speaker and the state’s Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, later yesterday visited Uromi to assess the situation, emphatise with bereaved families and to greet the people who were injured.

Onobun said: “What happened at Uromi on Thursday came to us as a rude shock. It is what one can best describe as an invasion. With what we have seen, the pictorial evidence and some videos that have been around on social media, it is quite unfortunate.

“With what I saw, even though we have not been properly briefed about what actually happened, you could see that the security was overwhelmed. It is quite unfortunate that such an incident could be carried out without any formal intelligence to the various security agencies, because I do not think that such an action was just planned overnight, because you have these criminals numbering over 20, with various vehicles and all sophisticated weapons.

“Considering the locations of the financial institutions and the area, it is quite porous, because we have a boundary with Delta State, and of course, there are some other routes to some riverine areas, especially Illushi, where there is the River Niger.”

Onobun called on the government at all levels to increase their vigilance, in order to check future occurrence of such dastardly incidents, while calling on security agencies to use the available pictorial evidence and videos to fish out the criminals.

He said: “I want to believe, with what we have in place, the security architecture that is put in a place by Edo state government, we will be able to track the armed robbers and bring them to justice.”

“For the local government where the armed robbery happened, Esan Northeast, it is one of the most populous local governments that we have in Edo Central Senatorial District, which has a standard police station and divisional police headquarters. So, we expect that the policemen have all the required equipment. From what we were told, the police station was also attacked. So, this is part of the investigations that the security agencies have to carry out.

“There are so many questions that are begging for answers, in order to know the people who conspired to see that the attempts to raid the people were successful. We also need to know how the criminals got into Uromi, that the security agencies were unable to pick on them, and they drove freely.”","Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Marcus Onobun, has blamed Thursday’s armed robbery incident at Uromi, Esan Northeast Local Government Area of the state on lack of intelligence by security agencies and the porous nature of the ancient town.

The President urged the National Assembly to give speedy attention to amendments suggested, especially deleting 84 (12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.

He said the Act holds a lot of promise for improving the election processes in the country, with the introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.

He said: “Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to Sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.

“This, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.

“Section 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election,’’ he said.

The President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.

“The practical application of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.

“It is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.

“Hence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84 (12) of the bill where political parties’ conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.

“Arising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly.’’

President Buhari commended the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.

“It is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.

“The Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.

“These commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of,”he said.

The President said he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government, after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes, before signing The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 into law.

President Buhari noted that the National Assembly forwarded the Electoral Bill for Presidential Assent, via a letter dated 31st January 2022.

The Senate President, Dr Ahmed Lawan, commended Buhari for signing the bill into law despite his reservations on 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022.

On Buhari’s request, Lawan said: “You know this is a legitimate request. And that is why I commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he had a disagreement with the section, especially clause 84 (12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.

“So we will look at what he is asking, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of essence; INEC is waiting.”

The Speaker, Gbajabiamila, described the signing as a landmark turning point in the political history after 12 years.

Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State said Buhari has proved critic wrong by signing the bill into law.

He said: “There’s been a lot of hullabaloo about this over the last few weeks, even bordering on scepticism that it would not be signed. I’m glad that some of us have been proved right, because we told the media that Mr President will sign this piece of legislation as soon as the section that he raised concerns about are removed from the legislation, and they’ve been removed, and he’s lived up to that belief that many of us have. Because he has always said to Nigerians anyway, that one legacy he would like to leave as he departs office is a credible and fair electoral system. And this will go a long way in making that possible.”

National Chairman, Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Yabagi Sani, said the new electoral act has put paid to electoral violence.","From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, AbujaPresident Muhammadu Buhari at exactly 12:27 signed the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 into law.

"Five years after, Evans, 2 others bag life jail for kidnapping","By Lukman Olabiyi

A Lagos State High Court, Ikeja has convicted and sentenced notorious kidnap kingpin, Chukuwuememe Onwuamadike, otherwise known as Evans, to life imprisonment for kidnapping.

Justice Hakeem Oshodi of the Lagos State High Court found Evans guilty of a two-count charge bordering on conspiracy and kidnapping of the Managing Director of Maydon Pharmaceuticals Limited, Donatus Dunu.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Apart from Evans, other two other members of his gang were also found guilty by the court for same offence.

The two other members of his gang found guilty were Uche Amadi and Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu.

Evans was arrested on June 10 2017 in Lagos by the police. Before his arrest, the police had placed a N30-million bounty on him in return for information that could lead to his arrest.

The defendants had earlier pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge preferred against them when they were first arraigned before the court by the state government.

While convicting the convicts, the judge held that the prosecution had succeeded in proving the charge against the three convicts beyond any reasonable doubt.

He concluded that the evidence tendered before the court, especially the videos evidence, collaborated the guilt of the convicts.

However, the court discharged and acquitted Ogechi Uchechukwu and two former soldiers of the Nigerian Army, Chilaka Ifeanyi and Victor Aduba for lack of sufficient evidence linking them to the crime.

The state had claimed that the convicts committed the alleged offence between February 14 and April 12, 2017.

The prosecution had further told the court that the incident took place at about 7:45 pm, along Obokun Street, Ilupeju, Lagos.

He disclosed that on April 12, Evans alongside the other five defendants, while armed with guns and other weapons captured, detained and collected a ransom of 223, 000 Euros from Donatus for his release.

The Lagos State government had arraigned them before the court on August 30, 2017 under Section 155 subsection 1 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2017, which carries life imprisonment.

The convicts were re-arraigned the defendants on October 19, 2017.

The prosecution closed its case against the defendants on January 10, 2020, after presenting four witnesses, including Dunu while the defence closed its case on August 3, 2020, after the six defendants testified.

Evans is also facing similar charges before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo and Justice Adedayo Akintoye of the same court.

Evans was arrested in June 2017 in one of his two mansions on Magodo Estate, Lagos, after seven years of high-profile abductions across the country, during which he collected millions of dollars in ransoms.

Six of his gang members identified as Nwosu Chukwuma, aka Sudo, 42; Suoyo Paul aka Nwana, 42; Felix Chinemerem, 36; Chukwuemeka Bosah, 28; Uchechukwu Amadi and Ogechi Amadi were arrested. Five AK-47 rifles, one AK-49 rifle, two English pistols, 59 AK-47 magazine with ammunition, 1,272 pieces of live ammunition of AK-47 (9mm) and five number plates were reportedly recovered from the suspects.

His reign of horror was brought to and end after the Inspector-General’s Intelligence Response Team (IRT) led by suspended DCP Kyari arrested him at his No 3, Fred Shoboyede Street, Magodo, Lagos home, after a fierce gun battle which lasted several hours.

Facts about his dreaded activities became clearer after one of his latest victims, Mr Donatus Dunu escaped from his den. He is a pharmacist and the owner of Maydon Pharmaceutical Company, Ilupeju, Lagos. He was abducted and kept for three months at one of Evans’ hideouts at No 21, Prophet Asaye Close, New Igando, a Lagos suburb.

Operatives of the IRT went into action and with the aid of high-tech equipment, they were able to track key members of the kidnap syndicate, rounded them up and then set the stage for the final arrest of Evans.","By Lukman OlabiyiA Lagos State High Court, Ikeja has convicted and sentenced notorious kidnap kingpin, Chukuwuememe Onwuamadike, otherwise known as Evans, to life imprisonment for kidnapping.

Biafra: My pact with Ojukwu -Uwazuruike,"Founder and leader of Biafra Independent Movement/ Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (BIM/MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazuruike says he has not wavered in his commitment to the Biafra cause.

He spoke on the renewed agitation for the sovereign state of Biafra; his non-violence approach and why it received world acclaim. He also flayed Igbo leaders for not working for the interest of their people in this interview with GEORGE ONYEJIUWA.

You started this renewed agitation for the Sovereign State of Biafra. Already it is now public knowledge that BIM/MASSOB is a member of the United Nations Unrepresented Peoples Organization. Now, what next?

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Well, I started MASSOB in 1999 with 25 agenda. Before I started MASSOB, I took into consideration the protocol of the Montevideo Convention of 1933 in mind. Before this time, there was this belief that the United Nations would recognise a people who are fighting for their independence using whatever means.

But the Montevideo Convention of 1933 spelt out the modalities for a group of people fighting for their independence. So, what I did is to come up with a 25 agenda of action towards the realisation of an independent Biafra. The first thing I did was to produce the Bill of Rights which I sent to the United Nations in the early part of 2000. I remembered that it was even one of our great sons, Emeka Obasi of Hallmark, who helped me with the correct addresses of the offices of the United Nations. However, I did not make the 25 agenda of action public because I knew that our people are hijackers and that they would steal the programmes. So, I was just taking them one after the other. One of the reasons is that at a certain stage in the struggle, we would have political parties for participation in elections in Nigeria because we took into consideration that referendum is not part of the 1999 constitution as amended and such provisions has to be inserted into the constitution before you start talking about referendum in Nigeria. And this has to be done by our own platform, our people and supporters. That was even why, at a later stage with the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, we even had to float the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), so that the APGA government in the South East could push for such agenda.

But the politicians who came into the party did not understand our motives but rather started carving their own agenda of becoming the president of Nigeria. Today, you can see where APGA is. Instead of a party that is supposed to be present in all the South East states, it is only now in Anambra State and being managed by a small group of people who are using APGA as their source of livelihood.

So, the question of what obtains today. I was taking these things virtually in consideration of the modalities of the Montevideo Convention of 1933. Today, we have a mini-constitution in BIM/MASSOB, which I drafted while being detained at Keffi Prisons. And after my release, it was ratified, which we are using today. It is also on that platform that we have our yearly elections through which our executives emerge. We have our parliament. These are the things that Montevideo Convention enumerated. You must have a constitution, executives, parliament and defined territory. You must have the population and you must have a mini-government and these are the requirements. And we are practising these things. That was even the main reasons that I established Radio Biafra London to educate our members and people that this is what we need to do to have an independent Biafra, and before you could be recognised by the United Nations. And that was even why the United Nations Unrepresented Peoples Organisation said that we are the people they are looking for.

Even before we were recognised, some pro-Biafra organisations had applied to be accepted into United Nations Unrepresented Peoples Organisation, but they were not accepted. But BIM/MASSOB was registered by the UNPO as the representative of the People of Biafra because we have been following the protocol of the Montevideo Convention of 1933.

Even before we applied, Rene Bonchi called me and said that we are the people they want and that he knew that we have been in the struggle for a long time and that was why they didn’t register any other Biafra group because they had not followed the Montevideo Convention protocol.

This Montevideo Convention protocol tries to tailor emerging new states to abhor violence, that is, emerging states can pursue their independence without violence and if you don’t follow that principle of non-violence you will never make sense to them. And that was why the applications of other Biafra Organisations were rejected by the UNPO.

Now, how does the membership of BIM/MASSOB in the UNPO help in the realisation of the independent State of Biafra when the same has no power to grant such?

It helps because many nations who formed the UNPO are today independent countries. Yes, they help and only few are yet to become independent. They may not grant you independence on their own, but they are attached to the United Nations representing all the unrepresented peoples and nations. While the United Nations is for the independent nations, the UNPO is for the non-independent nations of the world. But UNPO prepares the unrepresented nations and peoples for independence.

Since the UNPO cannot grant independence to any of its members, how has the leadership of BIM/ MASSOB been able to push its case to the United Nations General Assembly?

We are following the UNPO as a member who will bring up our case before the General Assembly and Security Council. Recently, UNPO is seeking to be admitted as a permanent member in the Security Council. Now, as BIM/ MASSOB, we cannot approach the Security Council but as a member of the UNPO, the UNPO will bring up our problem before the UN Security Council. The last time the UN had a meeting with selected members of UNPO, BIM/MASSOB was among them. It was the UNPO that sent the list of recognised members to the UN that participated in that meeting which was through zoom.

It has been alleged that you have been bought over by the government and given some largesse. How do you react to this?

I don’t even need to react because our people are fond of that. None of them asked me to start agitating for Biafra in the first place. I didn’t seek anybody’s permission to start agitating for Biafra in 1999. Since 1999 till date, has any of them contributed one dollar or one naira in the struggle for Biafra? All the time I had been in detention, did they ask whether my family was eating? Did they ask if my children were going to school? Did they send any delegation to visit me while in detention? Have they ever asked, how does this man eat that has brought out his time to fight for Ndigbo? I’m a lawyer and not a jobless man. I left my legal practice and started the agitation. I am 33 years now at the Bar, but I left it to fight for them. What they see is that Uwazuruike has been settled, Uwazuruike is no longer talking. What have they been doing? They are the ones setting me backwards. They are the ones sabotaging me, hijacking my platforms. Do you understand? They are the ones who would come to say Uwazuruike has been settled, that Uwazuruike has collected money. Collected money from who? Ask them who gave me this money? From which account was the money paid from to me? I don’t believe in any government giving me money and I am not a lazy man who waits for people to give him. Even though I am no longer practising but I still have to do something to make money to take care of my family. I am not a beggar. The most important thing is that I have set the struggle for the actualization of the independent state of Biafra in motion. Whether some people are doing it the right way or not, today the issue being discussed all over the world is Biafra independence.

Even if I start a party today, they will be the ones to sabotage it. The late Dim Ojukwu and I tried to promote APGA but the same persons accusing me of being settled hijacked and sabotaged the party, and today they are using APGA as kalokalo and said that they have sacked everybody. If I start another party or take over one of these mushroom parties, they will hijack it. The same people will come and say that they have expelled me from the party and hijack it. This is the way they hijacked my radio in London, hijacked APGA and even the Peoples Democratic Congress which we formed before APGA by Chekwas, Ojukwu and I. Don’t mind these people. I don’t even listen to them because they are saboteurs.

How do you think the issue of Igbo marginalisation should be best addressed?

Who is marginalising who? Ndigbo are the ones marginalising themselves. If you want to be marginalised, you will be marginalised. But if you don’t to be marginalised, nobody will marginalise you.

How?

Simple; they lack unity. Ndigbo hate themselves and they behave as if they don’t understand anything; even politics itself. They are talking of President of Nigeria. For where? How would they get it? It’s impossible as of today. How can you be talking of Ndigbo producing the president in 2023 when the South East governors are bifurcated in three parties? Two governors in PDP, two governors in APC and one in APGA? Which party will give you their platform to run with two governors in APC and PDP? There are only two parties in Nigeria today: the PDP and the APC that can contest for the presidency in the real sense. Which one of them can Ndigbo say that they are in control of its decision making? Which party can come to Igbo land and say they want to pick the candidate with two states? They don’t know anything. I have told Ndigbo that if they want to be President of Nigeria, all the governors must be in one party and if they see that you’re all in one party, they will begin to take you serious, that senses have come back. They should forget about 2023 because it is already gone and focus on 2027.

But the South East has been agitating that the presidential slots of the two major parties should be zoned to the South East…

Never. They will rather zone it to South-South or South-West. If you come to South-South, they have six states. And of these six states, only the Cross River State governor is in APC, and he recently joined. The South West has six states, and only Oyo state is PDP. The rest five are APC. You cannot compare it with South East. It is not possible for APC or PDP to zone their presidential ticket to the South East. They will never.

Are you saying that the cause of the marginalisation of Ndigbo is their lack of unity?

Yes of course, because they hate themselves. Now, take for instance all those people talking of President of Nigeria from Igbo extraction, how many have visited me as the Ijele Ndigbo, to tell me, even though they know that I have a platform of millions of followers? Rather, it is people from the North who have come here to seek my support for their ambition because they recognise me. But because we hate ourselves, my own people cannot come here because of hatred. They would rather go to the Yoruba and Hausa. It is not their fault because it is in their genes. With disunity, hatred and bigotry, how can we achieve anything?

My own position on the 2023 presidency is that it should be given to the youths. I have been saying it, let the youths take over the governance of this country, even if it is for four years. Both Bill Clinton and Obama all became the presidents of America in their 40s. The president of France, Macron is less than 50 years and these countries are super powers. I want this 2023 election to be ceded to the youths. We have youthful governors, senators, House of Reps members who are doing very well. In fact, my candidate for the 2023 Presidential election is the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. The young man came here all the way from Kogi State to seek my support. I think he will do well. He is about 46 years and serving his second term as governor. So, we should cede this 2023 elections to the younger generation. I would like a situation where the sons of Atiku Abubakar and Muhammadu Buhari will be coming out to contest for governors or the president. That has always been my view.

Ndigbo have been lamenting that the sit-at-home order every Monday is affecting the economy of the South East. Even though the IPOB has washed its hands from the matter. What do you think is happening?

I am not a member of IPOB. I am not in control and so I can’t decide for them. I first ordered the sit-at-home in 2004 and it was successful and we didn’t force anybody because we were working according to the Montevideo Convention protocol. In the 2004 sit-at-home, no force or intimidation or violence was used to compel people to obey. And if it was found out that either force or violence were applied in that sit-at-home, you have flouted the Montevideo Protocol because the whole world is watching. If it is discovered that people were killed, houses burnt in the sit-at-home, then the use of force and violence has made nonsense of what you have achieved.

Have you made any submission to the National Assembly on the issue of inserting the provision of referendum into the constitution, so as to give Nigerians the opportunity to vote for or against major political/economic policies as it is done in Western democracies?

I know what you’re saying. I have done enough for our people. I brought the issue of Biafra for the elite to use to negotiate. Do you understand it? Obasanjo became the President of Nigeria from the platform of the OPC. Abiola was denied becoming president of Nigeria, but when OPC started rioting, Obasanjo was made president to pacify the South West. The South South used MEND to make Jonathan president after the death of Umaru Yar’ Adua when they starting blowing up the oil pipelines in the Niger-Delta and Nigeria used Goodluck Jonathan to appease MEND. I brought the issue of Biafra but Ndigbo couldn’t use it. That is what I am telling you that they lack knowledge, yet they claim to know. But Ndigbo could not do that because of their hatred for Uwazuruike. But if they had used the issue of Biafra as a pressure group, Ndigbo wouldn’t have been going cap in hand begging for the presidency of Nigeria. It would have been the other way round. But because of their hatred for Uwazuruike, they couldn’t use it. That is why I said earlier that Ndigbo are the ones marginalising themselves. They cannot use what they have to get what they want because they hate Uwazuruike and they are afraid to be associated with Biafra.

But if they had used the instrumentality that I had provided for them, the situation would have been different. But since they have refused to use the platform, I had already provided for them, they will continue to beg to rule Nigeria till thy kingdom come, and they will never get it. It is the same people who are shouting Igbo marginalisation that sabotaged and hijacked APGA. Do you know what Dim Ojukwu, Chekwas and I suffered to form the party? And this same people frustrated everything. Look at Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Every year, the governors will come together and bring one stooge whether retired civil servant or politician who is a 90-year-old man who cannot even fend for himself and depend on you. That is the kind of a person they want who they will manipulate and who does what they want without thinking because he solely depends on the governors for his upkeep.

But they can’t use me because I am not a hungry man, neither do I rely on them for money. And so, of course I cannot be used by any governor to do what I don’t want to do and that’s why they don’t want to relate with me even though they know that I have millions of followers. Ask any of the governors if they have ever given me one kobo or whether I have ever sent anybody to them for money. They don’t like my kind of person who will tell them the truth but a stooge who will depend on them for his sustenance.

"Relief as Buhari Signs Electoral Act, Demands Alteration of Clause Banning Political Appointees","* INEC holds emergency meeting today on implementation

Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday signed into law the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him by the National Assembly on January 31, 2022, with a call on the legislative arm to amend Section 84 (12) of the Act which bars political office holders from participating in their parties’ primaries.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was jolted into action by the signing and summoned an extraordinary meeting of the Commission for today in Abuja, to discuss how to swiftly implement the Electoral Act 2022.

Speaking shortly before signing the document at a brief ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja, witnessed by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; among other top government officials, President Buhari said the amended Electoral Act “holds a lot of promise” for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.

He, however, stressed the need to amend section 84 (12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.

Buhari said: “From the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11), among others.

“This, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.

“Section 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at conventions or congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election.’’

Quoting section 84(12), “No political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election,” the President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.

According to him: “The practical application of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.

“It is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension, as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.

“Hence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84 (12) of the bill where political parties’ conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.

“Arising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84 (12) accordingly.’’

President Buhari commended the National Assembly for its commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.

He said: “It is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionise elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.

“The Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.

“These commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.”

The two chambers of the National Assembly had on January 25, passed the harmonised version of the Bill.

Buhari had withheld his assent to the earlier version of the Bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political players as part of the reasons for his decision.

But the president gave some conditions to give his assent – an action that prompted the lawmakers to re-work the Bill.

Lawan: We Will Consider Buhari’s Request to Amend Section 84 (12)

The President of the Senate, Lawan yesterday gave an assurance that the legislative arm will look into President Buhari’s request for the amendment of the clause in the Electoral Act which bars political appointees from participating in their parties’ primaries.

Speaking with newsmen at the State House, Abuja after the signing of the Electoral Bill into law, Lawan said the National Assembly would be willing to consider President Buhari’s request as soon as a Bill to that effect was brought before them.

He said: “You know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why we commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he had a disagreement with the Section, especially clause 84 (12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the Bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.

“So we will look at what he is asking for, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of essence, INEC is waiting; and because we don’t want to spill over some of these dates, unnecessarily. We will be expecting a communication from Mr. President with respect to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for amendment, but on the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria.”

The Senate President said with the Electoral Act in place, INEC should hit the ground running and ensure that successful elections are conducted in Osun and Ekiti states this year and the general elections nationwide in 2023.

Atiku, Saraki Hail Signing of New Electoral Law

Former vice president and the presidential candidate of the PDP in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar has commended the signing of the Electoral Act into law by President Buhari.

In his verified twitter handle, the former vice president said: “Now that the legal framework for the 2023 elections is in place following President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent to the Electoral Bill, INEC needs to roll-out the election guidelines in earnest so that the political parties and Nigerians can fully commence the journey to choose their leaders in 2023.”

On his part, former President of the Senate, Abubakar Bukola Saraki commended Buhari for finally signing the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill 2022, while also hailing the National Assembly, Civil Society Organisations and other Nigerians who remained persistent in insisting that Nigeria deserves a new law that will guarantee free, fair and peaceful poll in 2023 and beyond.

Saraki, in a statement signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Head of Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office, noted that while President Buhari deserves commendation for working with the federal legislature and rising above partisan interest to give the country a new law that could reform the electoral process, the big applause should go to the members of the civil society organisations who for the past one year have kept up the pressure and continuously agitated for the passage of the new Electoral Act.

INEC Holds Emergency Meeting

Meanwhile, INEC will hold a meeting today over the implementation of the Electoral Act 2022.

In a statement by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, INEC said the signing of the bill was historic.

“It contains many progressive provisions that will facilitate the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria.

“The nation now has the Electoral Act 2022 which replaces the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the new Act constitutes the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.”

INEC said given the tight timelines contained in the new law, it fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest.

“Consequently, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission is scheduled for Saturday 26th February 2022. Thereafter, a statement will be issued on the way forward,” the statement said.

Race to $200bn: CBN Unveils Incentives to Boost FX Repatriation,"*Offers N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at I&E window for third party use

James Emejo in Abuja

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday released guidelines for the implementation of the RT200 (Race to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation) Non-oil Export Rebate Scheme with immediate effect.

The scheme is in furtherance of the apex bank’s effort to reduce exposure to volatile sources of foreign exchange and to earn more stable inflows.

Under the new framework, the CBN is offering N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the I&E Window to Authorised Dealers and Banks (ADBs) for other third party use and $35 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the I&E Window for own use on eligible transactions only.

The bank added that payment of incentive shall be made on quarterly basis.

It said the accounts of exporters that qualify for rebates shall be credited latest one week after the end of the quarter.

This was contained in the CBN circular titled, Operating Guidelines for RT200 Non-oil Export Rebate Scheme, signed by Director, Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. O.S. Nnaji, and directed to all ADBs and the public.

CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had earlier this month announced a new programme to stimulate the country’s non-oil exports segment and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three and five years.

Emefiele said the scheme, code-named, “Race to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme)”, which takes immediate effect, consisted of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.

The rebate scheme is designed to incentivise exporters in the non-oil export sector to encourage repatriation and sale of export proceeds into the FX market.

It is born out of the need to develop new strategies aimed at earning more stable and sustainable inflows of FX in order to insulate the Nigerian economy from shocks and FX shortages.

The rebate is further limited to only exporters of finished and semi-finished goods wholly or partly processed or manufactured in Nigeria, except otherwise stated by the CBN, the circular added.

Emefiele had, at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers’ Committee in Abuja, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal, as well as biannual non-oil export summit.

Essentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy of FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country’s four major sources of FX inflow, namely proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.

He said, “I believe that the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.”

Emefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.

He said, “For example, we have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.

“In order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.”

"Russian Troops Enter Ukraine’s Capital, Kyiv, as Putin Calls on Military to Seize Power from Embattled Zelenskyy","* Pull back now, Nigeria tells Russia

Our Correspondents

Russian forces yesterday entered Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, as they continue their push to overrun the whole country and topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government.

This is coming just 48 hours after the invasion of the country by the Russian army on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.

Also yesterday during a televised address, Putin urged the Ukrainian military to seize power from Zelenskyy, saying “it will be easier for us to make a deal with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis.”

On the same day, the federal government met with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria, and called on Russia to pull back its troops from Ukraine.

Reports yesterday afternoon indicated that the Russian forces entered the Obolon district in the north of the city, just a few miles from the centre of Kyiv.

The Ukrainian President had said he was the target of the Russian invasion, vowing not to abandon his country.

According to the BBC, the Russian forces in Kyiv massed around the northern district of Obolon.

Videos online show armoured vehicles rolling down almost empty roads in the district. There are also videos appearing to show fighting between civilians and people in military uniform.

Kyiv has also reportedly being attacked from the air, with residents taking shelter in underground railway stations.

City officials are said to have told citizens in the Obolon district to stay at home to avoid “active military operations”.

Earlier in a Twitter post, Ukraine’s ministry of defence had appealed to the district’s residents to “inform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails (firebombs) and neutralise the enemy”.

Also, the Ukrainian forces reportedly pushed the Russian forces back, having blown up the city bridge to stop their advancement.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that Moscow was ready for talks “as soon as the armed forces of Ukraine respond to our call and lay down their arms”.

The Russian government had also said Putin was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, capital of Belarus, for negotiations with representatives of Ukraine.

The development comes after the Russian leader held a phone call with President Xi Jinping of China.

Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, said Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus, told the Russian leader he would “create the conditions” for such a summit.

Peskov said Russia did not intend to occupy Ukraine, saying their aims were clear –“demilitarisation and de-Nazification”.

Peskov added that the decision to open talks with Ukraine was in response to the request of President Zelenskyy.

“Following Zelensky’s proposal to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine, Putin can send representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Ministry and his administration for negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation,” the readout said.

The readout added that Minsk was chosen as the venue for the proposed talk.

Ukraine Arms Residents with Machine Guns

As pressure to capture Kyiv heightens, the Ukrainian government has armed volunteers at Kyiv with 18,000 machine guns and tasked them to defend the capital city.

Authorities have called on the population to resist the invading troops by all means.

The Interior Ministry adviser, Vadym Denysenko, stated that 18,000 machine guns “have been handed out in Kyiv to all volunteers, all those who want to defend our capital with weapons in their arms.”

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry had earlier posted a leaflet containing step-by-step instructions of how to make petrol bombs on its social media.

The Ministry of Defence and the Interior Ministry had sent an appeal to residents of Kyiv to inform the authorities of the movements of the invading troops.

Putin Tells Ukrainian Military to Seize Power

Putin has called on the Ukrainian military to seize power in their country.

Speaking yesterday during a televised address, Putin told the Ukrainian military it would be “easier for us to make a deal with you” than with “this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”.

He accused the Ukrainian leadership of using civilians as “human shields”.

“I once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis to use your children, wives, and elders as human shields,” he said.

“Take power into your own hands. It will be easier for us to reach an agreement.”

UN Condemns Arrests of Anti-war Protesters in Russia

The United Nations yesterday condemned numerous “arbitrary arrests” of people in Russia for protesting the country’s invasion of Ukraine and urged their immediate release.

“Arresting individuals for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or a peaceful assembly constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of liberty,” UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.

She said the agency understood that “more than 1,800 protesters were reportedly arrested. It is unclear whether some have now been released.”

Her comment came a day after Putin defied Western warnings to unleash a full-scale ground invasion and air assault on Ukraine that quickly claimed dozens of lives and displaced at least 100,000 people.

Protesters turned out in cities around the world, including in Russia.

An independent monitor said police had detained protesters in 51 cities across Russia, cracking down on dissent after authorities warned citizens against marching.

“We call on the authorities to ensure the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained for exercising these rights,” Shamdasani said.

UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned Thursday that the Russian invasion “clearly violates international law and puts at risk countless civilian lives.”

“It must immediately be halted,” she said.

Bachelet said her office would continue to closely monitor the situation and warned that “an information war is also underway.”

“It is particularly crucial at this time that we continue to closely monitor and attempt to verify reports of human rights violations, including civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects, including critical infrastructure, and other impact on human rights on the ground,” said Bachelet.

Pull Back from Ukraine Now, Nigeria Tells Russia

The federal government yesterday met with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria, expressing worries over the Russian-Ukraine conflict with a call for peace to resolve the conflict.

Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, met with the envoys yesterday in Abuja, saying that the Nigerian government called for peace and the use of diplomacy in resolving all differences.

Onyeama said Nigeria does not condone the approach of aggression by Russia, calling on Russia to pull back.

“Peace and diplomacy to be prioritised by both sides.

“We support every effort being made to stop the aggression and Russian troops to return to Russia,” Onyeama said.

Speaking to journalists after the closed-door meeting, German Ambassador to Nigeria, Birgitt Ory, who is also chair of the G7 Group, appreciated the African Union on its statement on the situation.

Ory, who also commended Nigeria for putting in its weight, said Nigeria is a very important voice that the world needed to hear.

"EXCLUSIVE: President Buhari's Government Plots To Add Office Of Chief Justice, Attorney-General, Others To List Of Political Leaders With Immunity","Power brokers in President Muhammadu Buhari's government and the National Assembly met on Friday night to add more political offices to the list of those to be given immunity, SaharaReporters has learnt.

It was gathered that the cabals wanted the House of Representatives Committee on Constitution Review to include the Chief Justice of the Federation, the Attorney-General, the Senate President and Speaker.

“They made up their mind last night on the list of political seat to get immunity. This include the Chief Justice of the Federation, the AGF, the Senate President and Speaker. They met last night to add those offices. They have been mooting a law to give them more immunity,” a top source disclosed.

Recall that last Wednesday, the National Assembly Committee on Constitution Review recommended immunity for heads of legislature and judiciary less than one month after it rejected the clause.

The recommendation was contained in the report laid by the committee before the House during plenary on Wednesday.

The presentation of the report by its Chairman and Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, was witnessed by the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, who was admitted into the chamber alongside Minister of Women Affairs, Paullen Tallen, and other women. See Also Politics Nigerian First Lady, Aisha Buhari Attends Senate Plenary

Although, Mrs Buhari did not state the reason for coming to the chamber, the visit could be linked to the gender-related bills.

The committee had stepped down the recommendation for immunity for heads of legislature and judiciary contained in a bill during a meeting with its consultants.

The bill, sponsored by Segun Odebunmi (APC, Oyo), is titled “An Act to alter section 308 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 to extend immunity to cover presiding officers of the legislative institutions”.

Odebunmi is the sponsor of the controversial National Broadcasting Commission bill and the Nigerian Press Council bill.

He also chaired the committee that approved the suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian Government.

Abdulhamid Mohammed, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, who is one of the consultants working with the committee, opposed the immunity clause in the bill. See Also Politics National Assembly Rejects Absolute Immunity For Senate President, Speaker, Other Principal Officers

“It is really unconventional all over the world for judicial officers and presiding officers (of legislature) to have immunity. It could also be self-serving from the angle of morality.

“There could be a conflict of interest if the immunity is now extended to judicial officers and that you need to go to the judiciary to seek leave to sue the officers concerned, you are now going to apply before the judicial officers because these are courts of competent jurisdiction. There are perhaps issues of bias,” he said.

Some members of the committee agreed with him while others opposed it.

Some of the lawmakers in the committee, who spoke against the bill during the meeting, include Uzoma Abonta (PDP, Abia), Rimamnde Shawulu (PDP, Taraba), and Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos).

The presiding officers of the legislative houses in Nigeria are the Senate President, Deputy Senate President, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of the Representatives and Speaker and Deputy Speakers of the state Houses of Assembly.

Only the President, Vice President, governors and their deputies currently enjoy immunity under Section 308 of the 1999 constitution (as amended).

The immunity clause for executives has been a subject of controversy for a while with Nigerians kicking against it.","It was gathered that the cabals wanted the House of Representatives Committee on Constitution Review to include the Chief Justice of the Federation, the Attorney-General, the Senate President and Speaker.

"Russia-Ukraine Conflict: NATO Activates Force For ‘First Time’ In History, Okays 40,000 Troops","The NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

This is the first time the Response Force will be activated since it was formed in 2002 at the Prague summit.

All 30 members of NATO must agree to activate the force, which they had earlier done on Thursday.

The NATO Response Force, which consists of about 40,000 troops, is a highly ready and technologically advanced multinational force made up of land, air, maritime and Special Operations Forces components that the alliance can deploy quickly, wherever needed.

The activation of the response troops does not mean that any US or NATO troops will go into Ukraine, which is not a member.

US President, Joe Biden, has been clear that US troops are being deployed to Eastern Europe to help bolster NATO countries nervous about Russia’s aggressive actions, and they will not be fighting in Ukraine.

“We have activated NATO’s defense plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces,” NATO heads of state and government said in a joint statement released Friday after the alliance held a virtual summit.

“We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance. We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defense across the Alliance, now and in the future.”

The Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of the NRF, called the force’s activation a “historic moment” according to a statement.

“They represent a flexible, combat-credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing their inherent agility,” Wolters said.

“These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.”

In a message released Friday morning, Zelensky thanked NATO for its support but urged the alliance to do more, lamenting the fact that Ukraine was left to fend for itself.","The NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

"Kaycee Madu, Nigerian-born attorney, cleared of misconduct -- but removed as justice minister","Kaycee Madu, Nigerian-born former minister of justice and solicitor-general of Alberta, a province in Western Canada, has been cleared of wrongdoing.

In January, Madu was asked to step aside from his ministerial position pending the outcome of a probe.

The investigation was launched after he reportedly called the police chief over a traffic offence ticket.

Madu, who was appointed minister in August 2020, was pulled over on March 10, 2021, and fined $300 for flouting the country’s traffic and safety regulations.

He was said to have been on his phone in a school zone.

He then reportedly called Dale McFee, Edmonton’s police chief, and discussed the ticket with him.

But on Friday, Madu was cleared of misconduct and transferred to the ministry of labour and immigration.

Jason Kenney, premier of Alberta, said Madu will now lead “important reforms to the Alberta advantage immigration programme” as labour minister.

“The report concludes that Minister Madu did not interfere in the administration of justice but that the phone call could create a reasonable perception of interference,” the premier said in a statement.

“It is clear from the report that his motivation in making the call was not to reverse the ticket but to raise broader concerns, particularly related to racial profiling.

“Nevertheless, as Ms. Kent concludes, ‘being angry, wanting assurances that he was not racially profiled are all understandable reactions, given the context of the phone call. It does not absolve the Minister from responsibility, but it is an explanation that deserves recognition.”

FACT CHECK: Did supreme court bar Aondoakaa from holding public office?,"A statement issued on February 24 by Terngu Obed, director of media in Mike Aondoakaa’s campaign organisation, said the supreme court did not bar the senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) from holding public office.

Some media platforms had published news stories, claiming Aondoakaa was barred by the apex court from holding public positions.

But Obed said detractors of the former justice minister’s ambition of becoming the next governor of Benue state were the ones peddling lies to deter his fast rising political base.

“This is nothing other than people who are afraid of my popularity or reasons best known to them. Or maybe they didn’t read the supreme court Judgement,” he told The Nation.

Aondoakaa was appointed attorney-general and minister of justice by late president Umaru Musa Yar’Adua on July 26, 2007.

In 2010, he was removed in controversial circumstances by Goodluck Jonathan, the acting president at the time.

BACKGROUND

Advertisement

Following the emergence of Bassey Obot as the substantive candidate to represent Uyo federal constituency in the primary election conducted by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom in 2006, his name was substituted with that of Bassey Etim even after Obot had been duly presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the PDP candidate.

On December 12, 2007, in a case with the reference number CA/C/45/2007, the court of appeal in Calabar delivered judgment in favour of Obot, ordering the president of the court of appeal to set up a new tribunal to adjudicate over Obot’s petition in Uyo.

After a petition from Etim, Aondoakaa, in his capacity as the AGF, wrote a letter to the president of the court of appeal, advising him not to comply with the decision of the lower court to constitute a new panel of judges to hear the matter.

Against the AGF’s advice, the president of the court constituted a new panel and gave judgment on April 18, 2008 that Obot be sworn into the house of representatives as the member representing Uyo federal constituency. In addition to this ruling, the court also dismissed Etim’s appeal with an order that INEC should issue certificate of return to Obot.

But in a twist, the former AGF wrote to Maurice Iwu, chairman of INEC at the time, asking him not to obey the judgment of the court of appeal, which he described as “obvious desecration of the institution of the judiciary.”

He also wrote to the speaker of the house of representatives recommending that the judgment of the appeal court be disregarded but “allow the status quo ante to remain until the last word is heard from the supreme court.”

As a result, Obot was not issued with the certificate of return by INEC nor sworn into the green chamber. So, Obot sued Aondoakaa in 2009 in his official capacity as AGF and personally as the 2nd respondent.

VERIFYING THE SUPREME COURT RULING

The federal high court in Calabar, Cross River state capital, granted Obot’s request restraining the 2nd defendant from further and/or continued occupation of the office of the 1st defendant and/or the discharge of the functions of the said office. The court further restrained Aondoakaa from holding any public office.

But Aondoakaa’s lawyer, in arguing his case, submitted that the learned trial judge restrained the appellant from holding public office instead of limiting himself to the prayer restraining him from holding office as the attorney-general.

Copies of a judgement obtained by TheCable, dated December 10, 2021, and delivered by Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, justice of the supreme court, the apex court affirmed the judgement of the federal high court in Calabar that the former AGF “ought not to be entrusted with any other public office at all.”

“It was indeed highly reprehensible for the chief law officer of the federation to counsel disobedience to any judgement at all, talk less of a judgement from which there is no further right of appeal,” the judgement reads.

“I am in complete agreement with the learned trial judge, as affirmed by the court below that having regard to the conduct of the appellant while occupying the sacred office of chief law officer of the federation, he ought not to be entrusted with any other public office at all.”

“I agree with the court below that the order made, though not specifically asked for, is a consequential order naturally flowing from the resolution of the questions for determination in the 1st respondent’s favour and the grant of his reliefs. As held in Amaechi Vs INEC (supra) the court has a duty to use its powers to do justice in the case where an attempt to subvert the administration of justice has occurred.”

VERDICT

The supreme court affirmed the judgement that Aondoakaa, the former AGF, be restrained from holding any public office in Nigeria.","A statement issued on February 24 by Terngu Obed, director of media in Mike Aondoakaa’s campaign organisation, said the supreme court did not bar the senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) from holding public office.

Igbo group: We've filed suit to make parties zone presidential ticket to south-east,"A group known as the Igbo Leadership Development Foundation (ILDF) says it approached a court to compel all political parties to zone their presidential ticket to the south-east ahead of the 2023 polls.

Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Friday, Godwin Udibe, ILFD chairman, particularly asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone their tickets to the south-east.

“May we also use this opportunity to appeal to the two leading political parties namely the PDP and the APC, to complete their actions on rotation by zoning their presidential tickets to south and particularly to the south-east, the only zone yet to produce the president of Nigeria since 1999, and indeed since after the civil war,” Udibe said.

“The PDP particularly needs not to be reminded that they wrote the principle of rotation of presidential power between north and south Nigeria into their constitution since 2009 and must obey their own rule to avoid litigation.

“By the way, may we also inform you that ILDF has made good its threat to go to court on the issue of rotation of presidential power and we are in the federal high court with the political parties on this subject matter.”

The chairman asked Peter Obi, former Anambra governor, to run for the office of the president.

“We will not end this press conference without advising and appealing to his Excellency Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to forget his perennial presidential ambition and support the south-east that have supported him,” he said.

"Osun: Timi of Ede, Oba Lawal Raises Alarm As Hoodlums Take Over Town","By Sunday Oguntuyi

The Timi of Ede in Osun State, Oba Munirudeen lawal, has raised an alarm over the spate of killings by hoodlums in the town, calling for urgent government intervention.

Addressing a news conference at his place in Ede on Thursday, Oba Lawal said that the security situation in the town was pathetic and unbearable.

The traditional ruler said that members of Oodua People Congress(OPC) and cultists were those currently terrorising the town.

According to him, though insecurity is a global phenomenon, but it is very alien to Ede people until the recent past.

Oba Lawal, who sympathises with the families whose relatives were killed maimed and houses razed, implored them to leave vegeance to God.

The traditional explained that he had never reneged in his responsibilities of securing lives and properties of the people in the town, adding that several efforts were being made to arrest the situation.

“The undisclosed personal grudge between the individual members of OPC, National Hunter Association, Ya Salam Vigilantee Group and the cultists metamorphosised into the serious war the community is waging now,” he said.

“Ede in the past is known to be one of the most peaceful cities in the Country, the land that used to shield, accommodate and protect other cities in and around it from terrorists.

“But now, the community members are being threatened physically, psychologically, emotionally and economically.

“Nobody can sleep with his or her eyes closed Presently in Ede, the sun sets at dawn.

“It is therefore very imperative that the governments and other security stakeholders to swing into action to avoid further loss of life and property.

“It is very uncultured to seeing human blood flowing in the day light. Life has no meaning to these intoxicated blood suckers.

“I wish to reiterate here that all efforts made in the past are in the best interest of my community without being fair or favour to either of the warring groups.

“I have never given supportive assistance to any of the dissidents.

“The Timi-in-Council has continued to make efforts at prevailing on the two sides to embrace peace and peaceful coexistence.”","By Sunday OguntuyiThe Timi of Ede in Osun State, Oba Munirudeen lawal, has raised an alarm over the spate of killings by hoodlums in the town, calling for urgent government intervention.

Nigeria to rebase GDP by year end – Harry,"Mr. Simon Harry, the Statistician-General of the Federation, has disclosed that processes are ongoing to rebase Nigeria’s consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation rate by the end of 2022.

He disclosed this yesterday in Akwanga, Nasarawa State, while briefing journalists on the sidelines of a two-day retreat for the Governing Board and Management of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

According to him, the statistical processes were already ongoing for the rebasing of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the size of economic activities in 2023.

“Certainly, there are processes involved for both macro-economic indicators, and without us accomplishing those processes, there is no way that rebasing can be done fully,” he said.

“For the GDP, which measures the performance of the economy, there are certain statistical activities that will have to be carried out.”

He said the National Business Sample Census (NBSC), which would determine the structure and dynamics of businesses in Nigeria had been done.

He added that the process for the National Agricultural Sample Census (NASC), which determines the status of growth of the agricultural sector, one of the major sectors driving the GDP, has begun.

Harry said further: “We are currently conducting the pilot, the main fieldwork will be commencing in April, and so that is a very important activity.

“The other important statistical activity that we will be carrying out is the Nigerian Living Standard Survey (NLSS), because we want the base year to be very current and so we do not want to use the 2018-2019 NLSS.

“This year, we are conducting a fresh NLSS and preparations have already commenced so that by June or July, we shall be going to the field hoping that the result will be out by November of this year.

“So, until all these activities are completed, one for the CPI, as we need the NLSS for us to be able to form a strong benchmark for rebasing, the same also for the GDP, we are looking at the end of the year for the CPI.

“But for the GDP, we are looking at principally 2023, to rebase it fully when all these activities would have been fully completed and the results out.”

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that rebasing of GDP entails the replacement of the old base year used for compiling the GDP with a new, more recent base year for computing the constant price estimates.

Certainly, there are processes involved for both macro-economic indicators and without us accomplishing those processes, there is no way that rebasing can be done fully.

On the retreat, Harry said it was basically to work out modalities for better work efficiency.

He said the NBS had come up with a four-year Corporate Strategy 2022 to 2025, which aligns with the National Development Plan (NDP).

According to him, the strategy is structured into seven priority areas – institutional and organisational development; infrastructure and human resource management; data production, which is the core mandate of the Bureau; statistical advocacy; information technology; and data dissemination.

“The belief is that if all these priority areas are well-implemented and meticulously organised, certainly, we will be able to take not just the Bureau but the entire statistical system in Nigeria to a loftier height and that is our target.”

The President, Nigerian Statistical Association (NSA), Godday Ebuh, said the place of statistics in NDP could not be overemphasised, as effective service delivery is dependent on efficient, effective and reliable statistics.

He said firstly, statistics is all about organising, gathering and planning for effective decision making.

“Now, if you are talking about national development, the key indices or the key indicators are all about statistics.

“So what are we planning, what are we going to achieve, so it is garbage in garbage out.

“Therefore, for an effective national development plan of any nation, efficient, reliable and good statistics is needed.”

Ebuh also said all hands must be on deck to achieve the NDP set goals and pledged the Association’s support in that regard.

The Chairman, Governing Board of NBS, Kabiru Nakaura, said in achieving the NDP in the next five years, emphasis must be placed on data and statistical gathering and dissemination, as that was the only way to achieve results.

According to him, no nation can develop without accurate data. “Our own responsibility is to supply the data to the government so it determines where it gets the resources, where to spend the resources and do things right.”

The Federal Commissioner representing Enugu State at the National Population Commission (NPC), Ejike Ezeh, said both agencies were into data generation.

According to him, synergy is necessary for both agencies to establish comprehensive data for national development.","Mr. Simon Harry, the Statistician-General of the Federation, has disclosed that processes are ongoing to rebase Nigeria’s consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation rate by the end of 2022.

Osogbo Progressive Splits Over Leadership Crisis,"By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo

Osogbo Progressive Union, the umbrella association of indigenes of Osogbo, has been battling with leadership crisis which has made the body moribund for some years now.

Investigation conducted by newsmen revealed that the crisis has crippled the association to the extent that more than half of its property which the union rely on to finance its activities through rents had been allegedly sold off and proceed allegedly diverted to private purse and some individual pockets.

It was also gathered that the leadership crisis had resulted in litigations most of which have not been disposed off despite that pleas by some elders of the community to settle out of court.

At the peak of the crisis, another association known as Osogbo Descendant Progressive Union (ODPU) was formed to replace the original OPU and all its property and secretariat located at Osogbo Town Hall had been taken over by the new body allegedly engineered by the current traditional ruler of the town, Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun Oyetunji Larooye 1.

The crisis rocking the union, according to investigation, got to the peak in 2015 when the monarch, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun Oyetunji who is the patron of the union, allegedly directed that Ambassador Siyanbola be made automatic head of the new executive of the union for second term in office and it resulted in litigation which lasted for more than six years without any headway.

In 2018, the monarch dissolved Ambassador Siyanbola led executive and formed Osogbo Descendants Progressive Union (ODPU) and asked the union to hand over to the newly created association which did not enjoy the acceptance and support of the majority of the indigene of the town.

Siyanbola wrote to the leadership of the new body against tampering with property of the union and it lost lots of resources during the period of litigations while many others lost hope and confidence in the affairs of the union.

A reliable source told our reporter that One Afolabi Fatai allegedly wrecked havoc on the property of the union as he claimed to have been appointed a consultant over the union’s property, terrorising tenants and collect certain percentage of the rents paid by tenants claiming same to be his commission.

In January 2021 some prominent elders intervened which brought relative peace to the union asking the union to settle out of the court. Some selected people that are neutral to form caretaker committee were contacted to run the union for one year after which credible election will take place.

This was after the court accepted terms of settling out of court on 20th January 2021. The chairman of that caretaker committee was Hon. Justice Kunle Adeigbe while others are Alhaji Gasali Kasmo, Alhaji Akeem Woleola, Mr. Suleiman Bodunrin, Bashir Gbodupe and Barrister Bode Babalola among others.

At this point, ODPU was still fighting on union’s property and Oba Jimoh Oyetunji was said to visited the Osogbo Town Hall where the secretariat of the union was located along with traditional chiefs, local hunters and traditional town crier going round the premises that henceforth rent to union’s property should be paid to the new union formed by Ataoja, ODPU through Fatai Afolabi.

Afterwards, the home branch body of the union organised an election which produced Alhaji Lamar Makinde as the new President of the union but the former caretaker committee claimed that it had already conducted another election through electoral college with Justice Kunle Adeigbe as Chairman an exercise which other people claimed was not known to them.

Kunle Adeigbe later petitioned the police alleging that Makinde led executive burgled into the secretariat of the union and carted away some vital items, the allegation was dismissed by the police after the conduct of investigation which was said to be false.

Oba Oyetunji was said to have not been happy with the new association which he formed, ODPU was not given free hands to operate and instructed one Alhaji Ajadi Badmus who is one of the living members of Board of Trustees of OPU to go and change OPU to ODPU.

The traditional ruler was also said to have directed the new President of the union, Alhaji Kamar Makinde to hand over key to the union’s property to him but Makinde tacitly begged him to allow him to consult the elders that he will do so at appropriate time.

When contacted, the President of Home Branch of the union, Alhaji Akeem Woleola confirmed the development and said his wish for the union is an independent OPU which would be detached from so many conflicting interests that have held Osogbo down for a long time.

Woleola stated that he and his team contributed more than enough resources to the union just to ensure a united OPU that is devoid of attracting undue influence such that do not good for Osogbo.

He cited some federal government projects that skipped Osogbo all because people who are suppose to fight for these projects got themselves engrossed in who become what in OPU just to protect hidden interest they plunk from the instability of the union.

Also, the current President of the union, Alhaji Kamar Makinde described the development as unfortunate noting that part of the land and property of the union were just sold off to one person stressing that his administration will ensure that all the property are legally recovered.

However, efforts to get across to Justice Adeigbe was unsuccessful as calls put across to him were not picked.","By Sunday Oguntuyi, OsogboOsogbo Progressive Union, the umbrella association of indigenes of Osogbo, has been battling with leadership crisis which has made the body moribund for some years now.

Adetola-Kazeem praised the participants for joining the mentoring program and thanked the mentors who are volunteering their time to develop the next generation of Nigerian leaders in public management, business and entrepreneurship, and civic leadership.

“Some of the features of this program include a job and career fair to bolster the impact of the YALI Learns program.

"Regional Bodies, CSOs, Parties Demand Commitment On Enforcement Of Law","Regional groups, political parties, civil society organisations (CSOs) and eminent Nigerians have implored relevant authorities to ensure that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday is strictly adhered to with a view to promoting fairness and credibility in future elections in the country.

After weeks of anticipation and outright suspense, the president eventually appended his assented to the electoral bill.

But Buhari did not sign the bill into an Act without getting a firm commitment from the National Assembly for an immediate review of section 84 (12) of the law which restricts serving political appointees, including ministers, from seeking elective offices.

The said section of the Act provides that political appointees seeking elective offices must first of all resign their appointments and that they.

It stipulates: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the nomination of candidates for any election.”

Speaking at the council chamber of the presidential villa after appending his assent to the bill, President Buhari who said the latest version of the bill was a great improvement from the earlier version which he refused to sign in November 2021 said in line with established tradition, he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government after careful and thorough reviews of the bill and its implications for the democratic processes in Nigeria.

He said, “The practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).

“It is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.

“Hence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of the practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties’ conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.

“Arising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly”.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Senate President Ahmed Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, chief of staff to the president, and secretary to government of the federation were present to witness the signing of the bill.

Although the president admitted that the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 passed by the National Assembly holds a lot of promise for improving the electoral process in the country, with the introduction of new technology and efforts to engender clarity and transparency, he highlighted the need to amend section 84 (12), which he said contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.

The president noted: “Distinguished Senators and honourable members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potential of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.

“This, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes a fundamental defect, as it conflicts with extant constitutional provisions.

“Section 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election”.

President Buhari commended the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.

“It is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.

“The Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.

“These commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of,’’ he said.

On their part, Senate President Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabimila, commended the president for giving Nigerians a law that will improve the nation’s electoral system.

Lawan pledged that the parliament would look into the president’s request on section 84 (12), saying the parliament expects an immediate communication on the proposed amendment.

“You know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why I commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he disagreed with the section, especially clause 84(12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.

“So we will look at what is asking for, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of the essence, INEC is waiting. And because we don’t want to spill over some of these dates unnecessarily we will be expecting communication from Mr President to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for the amendment but.On the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria,” Lawan said.

For his part, Gbajabimila said the 9th Assembly had delivered major legislations in its three years of existence.

“So we have over a year left and I believe we will begin to polish off some other pieces of legislation but the major ones, we have dispatched within the interest of Nigeria,” he said.

Reacting to the development, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) said they will continue to demand for electoral transparency, even as theycommended President Buhari, the media, National Assembly and other Nigerians for standing on the right path.

The executive director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, said assenting to the electoral bill was a big achievement that should be commended.

Rafsanjani who also doubles as the chairman, Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), thanked the National Assembly, Media, CSO and Nigerians for the collective success on having a new amendment to the electoral Act.

He said that under democracy people cannot be suppressed by the few interests groups, noting that CSOs will continue to demand electoral transparency in order to have good governance in Nigeria.

Rafsanjani said that President Buhari has fulfilled his obligations by upholding the values of democracy and assenting the electoral bill.

Rafsanjani noted that the protest, which CISLAC was part of, became necessary owing to the fact that the President Buhari-led administration has declined assent to the bill twice.

According to the CISLAC helmsman, the electoral act will guarantee INEC’s financial independence, which in turn will ensure the electoral umpire gets early funding on time to prepare for election.

In the same vein, Mr Rafsanjani appealed to Nigerians to comply with the electoral law.

He also appealed to Civil Society Organisations and the media not to relent in fighting for social justice as only then would we able to achieve the Nigeria of our dreams.

Also, reacting to the development, regional bodies, political parties and CSOs urged INEC and other relevant authorities to ensure enforcement of the law.

The apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said the signing of the bill into law will help to broaden and deepen democracy in Nigeria.

Spokesman of Ohananeze, Alex Ogbonnia, however insisted that it has put INEC on the alert to prepare for a transparent election in 2023.

Ogbonnia stated that with the signing, INEC has enough time to plan for the 2023 election, adding that INEC should not fail the people.

Also, the apex northern sociocultural group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) commended President Buhari for signing the bill into law.

In the same vein, Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) and the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) applauded the president for taking the bold step in signing the Electoral Act.

ACF through its national publicity secretary, Mr Emmanuel Yawe said, “It is a positive sign. The political temperature was unnecessarily heated up because of the delay in signing the bill. We hope this will go down if the demands of those agitating for the bill to become an Act are met. We also hope that this will lead to a smooth general election next year”.

Also, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), through its spokesperson Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, “This is a welcomed development, even though a little bit belated. INEC will roll out a comprehensive timeline. There is so much riding on what exactly is amended and how it will contribute to the quality of elections and the processes in this country.

“It is full of traps and daily people are putting more traps, we will however wait and see the actual content of the amended bill, because when I see what is amended and how it will contribute to the elections in this country, then one can talk more, I hope they will publicise it and I hope people will get opportunity to make an input and above all it is important we emphasis on the orderly and peaceful political electoral and other election activities.”

AYCF through the national president, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, said “I commend the president to have done what he did, this is what is expected from him as a statesman, it is one thing to sign the electoral bill and it is another thing for Nigerians to do the right thing. Often time people do the wrong thing not because there are no laws but because they don’t put them into practices and that is why sometimes things happen wrongly. Today I am happy he signed the amended Electoral Act, so nobody will hold him responsible for not signing it.”

Also speaking, the CNG through its spokesperson AbdulAzeez Suleiman said, “What is important is that the president has at last signed the bill after it suffered several rejections. It is now for legal experts and other professionals to x-ray and dissect its practical implications.

“Meanwhile, like most Nigerians who have called for electoral reforms, we are optimistic that the law will ease electoral processes and promote fairness and credibility in future elections especially that it also provides for the use of electronic voting and electronic transmission of results”.

On its part, the Pan Yoruba Social political organization, Afenifere, said the signing of the electoral Bill into law by President Buhari without constitutional amendment and restructuring of the country will not yield the desired results.

Afenifere’s acting leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, who stated this said, “I am not impressed, I am not impressed because to go into any election, without restructuring the country is an exercise in futility.

‘’Why conducting the election when the constitution under which you operate is against the election and the people, the constitution is fraudulent, we agreed it is fraudulent, why is he trying to change it, we all knew it is a military constitution, they(military) set aside the constitution Nigeria founding fathers gave to us.

“The military came with their own constitution and inserted in it, all the things our founding fathers have got rid of on credibility, but we should have told the military to return to the barracks with their constitution, but we failed to do that. That is my view, mind you I have few years to spend with you, but I have to leave my word with you.’’

Also speaking, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) said by signing the electoral bill into law, Buhari has advanced Nigeria’s democracy.

Speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, president of the forum, Dr Bitrus Pogu, expressed optimism that Nigerians will experience more transparency in the electoral process.

“Of course, the Middle Belt Forum is so grateful to Mr President. By signing the electoral bill, he has advanced our democracy.

“He has improved on the quality and transparency and the credibility of our elections. However, we should not stop at this point because it is not just voting electronically and transmitting the election results electronically. The number of accredited voters must be transmitted electronically,” Pogu said.

“So, the transmission should also include the accredited voters so that if the votes are transmitted, it will conform to the accredited people that took part in the process.

“We thank the president for obliging to the cry of Nigerians by signing this bill into law. So, our position is that it will not just be about transmission of election results electronically, but also transmission of the accredited voters,” Pogu added.

Also, the umbrella body of political parties in the country, Inter-party Advisory Council (IPAC), described the president’s action as a big achievement for the 2023 general elections.

IPAC said with the signing, Buhari has improved the electoral legal framework for the country.

Speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend yesterday, IPAC chairman, Yabagi Sani, congratulated the president, INEC and Nigerians on the feat.

“We congratulate the president for doing that. It is a landmark achievement. We now have an electoral bill that we can use for the 2023 general election.

“It’s a big achievement. IPAC congratulate the President and Nigerians. We also congratulate INEC because they now have an improved electoral legal framework. So, we are happy,” Sani said

On the return of the Electoral Act to the National Assembly for more work on section 8, IPAC said it is the prerogative of the president to do that, adding that he must protect the constitution of the country.

On its part, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) commended President Buhari for signing the electoral bill into law, saying it is a development which provides an improved legal framework in the lead up to 2023 electioneering processes and all coming elections.

A statement by national secretary of the party, Sen John James Akpanudodehe, noted: “This is a big win for our electioneering processes and our democracy. Since 2015 when the President Buhari-led APC government came into being, our commitment and support for constitutionally-permitted innovations that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria’s electioneering processes and internal democracy, have not been in doubt. The new Electoral Act is another pointer.

“From legal backing given to election management bodies to review election results declared under duress, provisions for people with disabilities and special needs, electronic transmission of election results among other key provisions, current and coming generations will fondly remember President Buhari as the courageous leader who institutionalised credible elections and internal democracy in Nigeria.

“We note with appreciation the patriotic efforts of the National Assembly, civil societies, development partners and indeed all well-meaning Nigerians whose collective efforts and support has birthed the new Electoral Act.

“The task of improving the credibility of our elections is a collective and continuous one. As a party and government, we will continue to champion needed reforms. We hereby call on well-meaning Nigerians to join us to completely stamp out past practices of electoral fraud weaponised by past administrations of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).”

But the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the newly signed Electoral Act is a death knell for the APC) which thrives in manipulations, ballot box snatching, ballot box stuffing and alteration of election results at the collation centers against the expressed will of the people.

It congratulated Nigerians, particularly Civil Society Organizations for fighting on the side of the PDP in putting pressure on President Buhari to finally assent to the electoral bill.

The party also saluted the courage of PDP and other opposition members in the National Assembly for standing their ground on the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill which among other things principally provided for the electronic transmission of election results directly from the polling units.

The national publicity secretary of PDP, Hon Debo Ologunagba, said, “The PDP calls on Nigerians not to rest on their oars but to further strengthen their resolve by rallying themselves to take charge of their polling units and ensure that their votes are transparently counted and transmitted in the 2023 general elections.","After weeks of anticipation and outright suspense, the president eventually appended his assented to the electoral bill.

Trapped Nigerians Can’t Be Evacuated Until Airport Reopens – Federal Govt,"Until the airports in Ukraine are opened, Nigerians trapped in the country may not have an easy exit, the federal government has been told by the authorities of Ukraine.

Consequently, the Nigerian government is weighing the option of evacuating the affected citizens by road.

This was one of the outcomes of the meeting Nigeria had with the two envoys of Russia and Ukraine to Nigeria yesterday.

The Ambassador of Ukraine Kirdoda Valerii had said that his country’s air space was no longer safe for flying and that the airports had been closed.

Nigeria had summoned the Ambassador of Russia Alexei Shebarshin and Valerii following the escalating violence triggered by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Thursday.

The minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, who met with the envoys separately behind closed doors, told reporters that during his parley with the Russian envoy, he expressed the displeasure of the Nigerian government over the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a United Nations (UN) member state, and country with which Nigeria has diplomatic relations.

Onyeama also told Shebarshin that Nigeria wants Russia to revert to the status quo before the military action and to prioritise diplomacy and dialogue.

“This is really the position of the government. And also, that we have 5,600 Nigerians in Ukraine and we are very concerned about what we are hearing and what we are seeing regarding missiles and bombs about the safety of our Nigerian citizens there, that we would like to be able to evacuate them,” he said.

According to Onyeama, the Russian envoy promised to communicate the concern of the Nigerian government to his home country, adding that Russia considers Nigeria a friendly nation and would do nothing to harm her citizens. The envoy assured the minister that their action is targeted at military installations and not against civilian areas.

ADVERTISEMENT

Onyeama said he also discussed with the Russian envoy about the practicalities of how Nigeria can get her citizens out of Ukraine, those who want to leave the country and what measures they could apply to facilitate to safeguard Nigerians in Ukraine, adding that hopefully, the war won’t last long.

On the question about the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine, the minister said the issue can only come up when the airports open.

Onyeama said the Russian envoy stated that they would also see some airports as military targets possibly.

The minister further discussed road travel as an alternative to facilitate the evacuation of Nigerians even though some Nigerians have been able to flee into the neighouring countries such as Poland.

The Russian envoy, however, told Onyeama that there might be risk involved, while also saying that Russia was mindful of the civilians from foreign countries and promised to take all the necessary measures to ensure their security.

“He was a lot more sanguine, optimistic that no harm will come to them, but we cannot take any risks,” Onyeama stated.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the same vein, Onyeama, after his meeting with the Ukrainian envoy, expressed the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the country over the war imposed on the nation and its people that came under heavy bombardment, which has led to dozens of deaths and injuries and destruction of property.

The minister pointed out that Ukraine is a country that Nigeria has diplomatic relations, a member of the UN and cannot condone the violation of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.

He also told the Ukrainian envoy that Nigeria has over 5,000 students and citizens in the country and was very concerned about their safety and welfare.

“And we certainly want the cooperation of the government of Ukraine to do whatever is possible to ensure their safety and security and to also seek advice as to how the evacuation can be facilitated,” Onyeama said.

According to the minister, the envoy said the Ukrainian government has given all the residents and civilians, specific instructions about how to stay safe and the measures to take.

He said the Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine will also act as a coordinating mechanism in reaching out to all Nigerians in Ukraine and ensure that they adhere to the advice and directives.

On his part, the Ukrainian envoy expressed gratitude to the government and people of Nigeria for their support.

“Right now, we are in a very difficult situation, but we are fighting against the aggression and we believe that we will all win,” the Ukrainian envoy said.

Valerii also said Nigerian students in Ukraine were in the same situation as anybody else in his country.

“Ukrainian government does not differentiate between people on the basis of their nationality and that is the best effort to protect everybody.

“Currently, the evacuation of Nigerian students is not possible because it is not safe to fly on the sky of Ukraine. As soon as it is safe to fly on the sky of Ukraine, we will join the Embassy of Nigeria in Ukraine and jointly with the Nigerian government, we will arrange for the evacuation of Nigerian students,” the envoy said.

On the reports that Nigerians are being conscripted into the Ukrainian army to fight, the envoy noted declared that it was optional.

The federal government also yesterday raised concerns over the refusal by Poland to allow Nigerians fleeing the conflict in Ukraine into the country even when nationals of other African countries were reportedly being allowed into Poland.

The minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, raised this issue on behalf of the government when he met with envoys of European Union countries in Abuja yesterday.

Onyeama noted that the government was receiving emergency calls from Nigerians who were going by road, evacuating Ukraine and a lot of them heading to Poland.

“We have had a number of calls, desperate calls and that there are cases of women and pregnant women and so forth,” Onyeama said.

The minister also said the government was informed that nationals of other African countries were being allowed into Poland and wondered why Nigerians were being denied entry into the country.

According to the minister, the Polish Ambassador to Nigeria, Joanna Tarnawska, has however, assured him to immediately check with the capital in order to address the situation.

Nigeria is preparing to host the president and first lady of Poland, and it appears to the government as an aberration that a situation that people fleeing a global crisis like what is taking place in Ukraine should be prevented from getting out to safety.

“So, we hope that also the European Union and others, and if that is indeed the case, will prevail on, not just necessarily Poland, but also any other border country to please share some sympathy and humanness to refugees fleeing this crisis, be they Nigerians or any other nationality,” Onyeama said.

Tarnawska, in her remarks, however said Poland was taking every necessary step to provide safety for those fleeing Ukraine.

Earlier, the Head of the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Samuela Isopi, who led the delegation, said the meeting justified the importance that the EU attached to the issue of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

Isopi told Onyeama that the European Union was ready to assist Ukraine with help, including financial and humanitarian assistance.","Until the airports in Ukraine are opened, Nigerians trapped in the country may not have an easy exit, the federal government has been told by the authorities of Ukraine.

"Recruitment: VIPs Lose Out In NSCDC’s 5,000 Jobs","The selection of 5,000 men and officers from the 1.5 million Nigerians who applied for vacancies into the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has not gone down with some prominent Nigerians. Their candidates did not make the final list.

The recruitment process started in 2019 and lasted till this year when the incumbent minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbsola and the commandant-general of the corps, Dr. Abubakar Ahmed Audi, concluded it.

When the final list came out, LEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that some governors, senators and members of the House of Representatives, traditional rulers from some parts of the country and businessmen protested because their candidates were missing on it.

Consequently, they mounted pressure on the minister and CG who allegedly insisted that in view of the precarious security situation, the federal government could afford to compromise on stands in the recruitment of men and officers into the NSCDC.

It was learnt that by the insistence on merit by the minister and the CG, the affected leaders went to high authorities to “press buttons” but failed to realise their ambition as the presidency reportedly refused to intervene in the exercise.

ADVERTISEMENT

It was learnt that it was against this backdrop that some governors cried out that the names of candidates in their states’ allocations were alien to them.

A credible source in the ministry of interior told LEADERSHIP Weekend; “We adhered strictly to the rules of fairness, justice and equity in the selection process.”

Investigations revealed that both the minister and the NSCDC boss who inherited the selection process which began in 2019 ignored the sordid path that the recruitment process had often charted and refused to bow to pressures from influence peddlers in the country but ensured that the selected 5,000 recruits emerged through merit.

The source in the ministry said a former minister of interior who started the recruitment process, a former commandant-general, past and serving governors, senators and House of Representatives members were the worst hit because their lists enjoyed preferential treatment in the past.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Civil Defence, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board (CDCFIB) opened its recruitment portal on August 9, 2019, where it later disclosed that 1.4 million Nigerians had scrambled for the 5,000 job openings advertised by the NSCDC.

When the application portal was opened in 2019, about 1, 477, 042 Nigerians applied for various spots but using a set of criteria, the figure was pruned to 217,000 in March 2020 and 53,116 in December 2020. Sometime in 2022, the figure was again reduced to 6,500 before the final screening which arrived at the targeted 5,000.

A top source at the board told LEADERSHIP Weekend that contrary to claims in some quarters, the process was hijacked by Aregbesola and Audi’s predecessors, political and business heavyweights, who reserved slots for their preferred candidates through backdoor, “We could not risk the nation’s future, development and progress by presenting less than the best for the job.”

Under the old order, 10-40 percent of the total slots were reserved for the powers that be and later increased to between 40- 80 percent, a practice that had led to the less competent dominating the corps. However, Aregbesola and Audi stepped on every toe imaginable to achieve the goal of selecting only the most qualified 5,000 candidates.

However, some aggrieved staff members of the board have argued that the usual “who gets what, how and why, the drama that characterised the over two years recruitment process brought to the fore, the wishy-washy manner in which individuals who were not even capable of spelling their names, but were highly favoured got key positions into the various sectors of the polity at the detriment of those who merited them.”

When contacted on certain allegations against key actors in the recruitment process, the director of public relations of the corps, DCC Olusola Odumosu, told our correspondent that the selection was purely on merit. He expressed shock at the news that some powerful toes were stepped on as he categorically said that no prominent Nigerian attempted to influence the process.

He said, “The truth is that all the classification of persons you listed are well meaning Nigerians who understand that the nation requires its best and brightest to pilot it through the turbulence of nationhood and the challenges of development. I strongly believe and I am aware that all former ministers of interior and CGs of the Civil Defence take this philosophy very seriously and strive often to put their best foot forward. For as much as I know them, favouritism, tribalism and playing the second team just does not suffice. Only the first eleven will do. I mean, the best.”

Odumosu said both the minister and his boss were ardent believers in the logic that the most qualified should get the job. They both do not give room to mediocrity in recruitment. There is ample evidence to show, he said.

“Yes, selecting these 5,000 following the rot that had attended the system was no mean task. It was one which came with a lot of danger. It was not a job for the faint-hearted or the lily-livered. It was a job for the brave and lion-hearted. It was a job for the fearless and incorruptible. Aregbesola and Audi fit that bill,” he said.

Odumosu added; “The Civil Defence Corps understands that a drowsy work-force is not what we need in the country, especially at a time when the nation needs a surgical operation on all fronts to solve the myriad of problems confronting it on a daily basis.

“I can beat my chest to tell you that they both spearheaded institutional reforms through the establishment of due process mechanisms and strategies that became the nightmare of fraudulent persons. As far as this selection is concerned, the two leaders were fearless in the discharge of their duties and shunned attempts to compromise them. Yes, they spoke with authority and acted with finality against favouritism.”

The spokesman added, “My boss is one person who firmly believes that Nigerians must go back to the days where merit, professionalism, expertise and willingness to work dominated the workforce which yielded viability and sustainability. He is of the school of thought that argues that leaders must begin the process of placing into leadership positions square pegs in square holes, so that efficiency can take the centre stage in our polity.”

Further findings by our correspondent showed that those who were secretly offered employment and were gearing up to assume duties prior to Audi’s resumption of office were thrown out.

A source close to the interior ministry in Abuja said the federal government was deeply embarrassed by the controversy surrounding the NSCDC recruitment and would, therefore, not allow what it described as “backyard” recruitment into the service.

The source said, “I can say that the government prior to this final list, cancelled the backdoor recruitment exercise that was carried out and took appropriate steps to recruit in a transparent way.

Already, the Bauchi State House of Assembly has rejected the outcome of the recent recruitment process as it relates to the state, declaring it as a scam.

The resolution of the House followed the submission of the report of the Joint Committee on Security and Public Service on the exercise by the corps which was laid by Hon. Sabo Bako Sade, representing Sade Constituency.

According to the report, the committee discovered that after the screening for the recruitment, the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the state communicated to the Assembly that there was a scam during the exercise in which seven of the 10 applicants whose names appeared on the state’s list were discovered to be non-indigenes as reported by Hon. Jamilu Umaru Dahiru, the member representing Bauchi Central.

The committee has since recommended that the outcome of the exercise and communicate the same to the national headquarters of the NSCDC.

Also recently, Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum gave reasons why the nation’s security system is seldom compromised.

He was quoted to have said, “These days, the governors, ministers and other top government functionaries have slots; nobody is to interview them whether they are qualified or not. Admission into the Nigerian Army, police and other security agencies are now politicised.”

According to him, the undue influence of politicians has made it almost impossible for the country to get the required commitment and dedication from those recruited into the security agencies.

His words, “The major problem is the recruitment process, those being recruited into Nigerian Army, police, and other security agencies are job seekers, many of them are there because they don’t have a job. Those enlisted 20 years ago are performing well but these people are looking for employment only, so there’s no commitment and dedication.”","The recruitment process started in 2019 and lasted till this year when the incumbent minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbsola and the commandant-general of the corps, Dr. Abubakar Ahmed Audi, concluded it.
Sometime in 2022, the figure was again reduced to 6,500 before the final screening which arrived at the targeted 5,000.

Court Sentences EvansTo Life Imprisonment For Kidnapping Bizman,"Justice Hakeem Oshodi of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja yesterday convicted and sentenced kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, also known as, Evans and two others to life imprisonment for conspiracy and kidnapping.

Justice Oshodi handed down the verdict after he found Evans, who is also known as the billionaire kidnapper, guilty of a two-count charge of kidnapping the managing director of Maydon Pharmaceuticals Limited, Donatus Dunu.

Others convicted alongside Evans are Uche Amadi, Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu.

The judge held that the prosecution had succeeded in proving the charge against the three convicts beyond a reasonable doubt.

In reaching his verdict, the judge further held that he observed the demeanour of the witness, saying, “He showed no remorse in the dock and tried to lie his way out of the crimes despite the video evidence.’’

The judge noted that in some of the confessional videos exhibits played in court, Evans mentioned some of the other defendants and the roles they played in the crime.

Justice Oshodi said, “He was seen freely laughing and willingly answered questions. A close look at his body shows no sign of torture. He did not look unkempt. He was seen laughing even when he was told that he must be a rich kidnapper.

“In court, he alleged that the recordings were staged, this is an afterthought and a ploy to escape Justice.

“I therefore found the first, second and fourth defendants guilty of the charge of conspiracy to commit kidnapping and kidnapping and they are convicted as charged,” he held.

ADVERTISEMENT

However, the court discharged and acquitted Ogechi Uchechukw and two former soldiers of the Nigerian Army, Chilaka Ifeanyi and Victor Aduba for lack of sufficient evidence linking them to the crime.

After the court judgment, the defence lawyers pleaded with the judge to temper justice with mercy by giving the convicts a second chance.

According to him, they have demonstrated remorse and were first-time offenders.

But the judge disagreed with the defence lawyers that the convicts had shown remorse, saying they were unrepentant and they comfortably lied to the court.

Justice Oshodi, therefore, held that the law must be applied to send the right message to the public that crime does not pay.

The state had claimed that the convicts committed the alleged offence between February 14 and April 12, 2017.

The judge is, however, yet to sentence the convicts as the proceedings are still ongoing.

Evans is also facing similar charges before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo and Justice Adedayo Akintoye of the same court.","Justice Hakeem Oshodi of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja yesterday convicted and sentenced kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, also known as, Evans and two others to life imprisonment for conspiracy and kidnapping.

Agony Of Borno Student Whose Throat Was Slit For Refusing Errand,"Jubril Sadi Mato (Ramadan), an 11-year-old pre-junior student of Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri, woke up in the wee hours of January 15, 2022, had his ablution and observed his prayers with hope of a brighter day ahead.

He went about the activities of the day, full of life. But by nightfall, when most students had begun to retire to bed, Ramadan as he is fondly called, had his life almost snuffed out by his senior colleague.

LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that a senior colleague, from SS2 Class had sent Ramadan on an errand, but he refused to go.

That fateful night, the senior colleague then picked him up and took him to a lonely place and used a razor blade to severely cut his neck, injuring most of his artery nerves and trachea.

His attacker, who was later identified as Ahmad Umar Goni, left the victim to die with his body soaked in blood.

ADVERTISEMENT

But after some minutes, Jubril struggled and found his way to the principal’s office, before he finally broke down and became unconscious.

Jubril was rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) as he laid critical at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the perpetrator, who was alleged to be indoctrinated on psychotropic substances, was subsequently arrested and handed over to police for further investigations.

A family member of the victim, who spoke with LEADERSHIP Weekend on condition of anonymity, noted that the case of Jubril had effectively been decriminalised as a result of a collapse in prosecutions that has allowed many offenders to escape justice and to go on to reoffend in the knowledge that they are highly unlikely to be held accountable.

He said for the fact that their acts of violence are normalised, accepted or excused, give a feeling of power and impunity to these individuals and encourages such recurrent shameful predatory behaviour.

ADVERTISEMENT

This support system, the family member of Jubril said, must be annihilated at all cost and in no uncertain terms.

“This is not the first case of armed violence in the college, there are several other cases relating to sexual abuse and armed violence, but the school management had swept them under the carpet. This is likely to mean we are creating more victims as a result of our failure to act.

“This can result in far-reaching and catastrophic consequences on the physical and mental state of any child. Because It is, amongst others, responsible for a decrease of academic performance and a high proportion of school dropouts, denying its victims the very right to education,” he said.

He therefore appealed to Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum, the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Legal Aid Council and other reputable organisations and individuals to seek redress for Ramadan as his condition remained critical at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital.

Some students of the school, who also spoke on the issue, claimed they were told by the management that Jubril attempted to commit suicide because he hated being a boarder.

One of the students, who craved anonymity, said, “They told us that he tried to kill himself with a razor blade by cutting himself. But we later learnt that it was one of our seniors who wounded him for refusing his errand.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We don’t know his present condition. I hope he is not dead?” he said.

A senior staff of the college, who also craved anonymity, said: “On the same day, a delegation from the Borno State Ministry of Education visited the college when the director departed to Damaturu, Yobe State, leaving his principals behind; they were told that the principals were not on site.

The source added that the suspect committed the act under the influence of drugs which were being secretly sold to students by a senior managing officer of the Junior Secondary School Section.

According to him, the college management covered numerous cases of misconducts perpetrated by the students and some of the staff members without the knowledge of the parents, even though, the Parent and Teacher Association (PTA) was scrapped for years, following mass protest over increment and change of school uniforms by the management.

In a swift reaction to media reports on the incident, the principal, Mr Kashim Ibrahim Abdullahi, through a press statement signed and issued on the 22nd February, 2022, said the suspect, Ahmad Umar Goni, an SS2 student for an unknown reason partially cut the throat of one student, Jubril Sadi Mato of pre- junior secondary school.

The statement added that the matter was immediately reported to the principal of the junior secondary school who rushed the victim to Borno State Specialist Hospital from where they were referred to the trauma centre of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH), where Jubril has been receiving medical attention, adding that staff of the college queued up to donate blood for the victim and the school fully took financial responsibility.

The principal said according to the provision of the law of the land, the college has no right to treat crime cases of such magnitude and thus handed the culprit over to the police a few hours after the incident for further investigation.

The principal said:” The management of Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri issued this press statement regarding an incident that took place in the college on Saturday night, 15th January, 2022 at about 10: 05pm, immediately after prep.

“One student Ahmad Umar Goni of SS2A for an unknown reason partially cut the throat of one student, Jubril Sadi Mato of Pre-JSS.

“Unfortunately, some media houses, individuals as well as other critics of the college without any proof or verifiable evidence went on spreading false information when the college itself is still waiting for the police to conclude their investigation.

“Therefore, the management of the college denounces all these conspiracies and fake news about the incident. For instance, several allegations were made against the college of allegedly conniving with the parents of the culprit and the guardian of the victim to conceal the fact about the incident.

“Contrarily, the testimonies of both the parents in their media interactions debunked these allegations which were meant to dent the image of the college. It is also noteworthy to mention that such an incident has never occurred in the 47-year history of the college.

“Most importantly, Jubril is now getting better by Allah’s grace. The management of the college, its entire staff and students sincerely sympathise with the family of the victim and earnestly pray for his full recovery. “

The ministerial emergency committee for the investigation of attempted homicide at Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri was upgraded to state committee by the Zulum administration.

The committee was approved by Borno State Governor Babagana Umara Zulum on 25th January, 2022, to investigate the reported attack on a pre-JSS student, Jibril Sadi Mato, by a senior student on 15th January, 2022.

The setting up of the committee was contained in a statement signed by the secretary to the state government (SSG), Alhaji Usman Jidda Shuwa.

Shuwa stated that the committee was headed by the acting permanent secretary and solicitor-general of the Borno State Ministry of Justice, Abdullahi Husaini Izge, while it has directors of schools, ministry of education, representatives of civil society organisation, chairman of Borno State Parent and Teacher Association (PTA), representatives of Department of State Services (DSS),and the state police command, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) as well as the secretary of Cabinet Affairs, Governor’s Office, among others.

The statement added that the committee will be inaugurated by the state deputy governor, Umar Usman Kadafur, at his office on Wednesday, 26th January, 2022.

Meanwhile, family members of the victim have decried the inability of the committee to make its findings public since over three weeks after the incident.

The family members through a statement issued by their lawyer wondered why no member of the family was represented in the committee.

A cousin of Jubril Sadi Mato, Aisha Mato, while expressing worry over the continued delay in addressing the cause of the incident to our correspondent, said the victim has remained at home since he was discharged from the hospital and that the injuries which was not properly handled by UMTH is currently developing complications hence they want to take Jubril to an Egyptian hospital for further treatment.

She regretted that neither the school management nor the state government has reached out to them since their son was discharged from the intensive care unit of UMTH a fortnight ago despite countless efforts to ascertain the true situation that led to their son being cut on the neck.

She said: “Ramadan (Jubril’s pet name) has not overcome the trauma of that incident. Since he was discharged from the hospital, he has refused to return to school or even agree to go to another school despite our efforts to get him enrolled in a new school. He keeps saying he does not want to go to school again because he will be killed.

“And lately, the unhealed injury has developed complications with his stomach swollen with constant foaming from his mouth. This is why we want to take him to a hospital in Egypt for proper medical attention.

“We have been waiting for the state government to tell us the findings of their investigations but up to this moment, they have not said anything to us. The school management too has kept silent. We are at the crossroads at the moment because we don’t even know what is happening.

“It seems there is a conspiracy to sweep the matter under the carpet but we will not allow that to happen. We actually heard the rumour that the school management attempted to hide the incident from getting to the public space but we did not believe it, but with what is happening now, we tend to give credence to that rumour. But we will pursue this matter to a logical conclusion because we want justice for our son,” the cousin said.

Corroborating Aisha Mato, another cousin of Jubril, Adam Mato, said the victim, who has suddenly developed complications, needs further and urgent treatment in a better hospital.

He appealed to the state government and the school management to join the family and restore the health of Jubril whom he said is in urgent need of medical attention.

“The management of the school is not even following up to know the condition of the boy. They have been nonchalant about the issue. It is very sad,” he lamented.

He claimed that UMTH had not been helpful by refusing them a referral letter that would assist the new hospital to understand the kind of treatment and where it stopped on the boy.

He said the UMTH management has been dribbling them whenever the request is made by the family.

But a credible source in UMTH who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there is no way the hospital can give them a referral letter after the boy had been discharged from the hospital.

The source said unless they bring him back on admission to be discharged with referral, the request won’t be granted.","LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that a senior colleague, from SS2 Class had sent Ramadan on an errand, but he refused to go.

The pictures show a hole covering at least five floors that were blasted into the side.

Authorities say the number of casualties is “being specified” while an evacuation is under way.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned down an offer by Washington to help evacuate him from Ukraine, US media outlets say.

Mr Zelensky said “the fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride”, the Associated Press reported, citing a senior intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation.

The Washington Post had also quoted US and Ukrainian officials who said that the US government was prepared to help Mr Zelensky.

Mr Zelensky has been widely praised on social media for his response to the Russian invasion. The former comedian and actor had earlier given a moving speech in which he vowed to keep fighting, saying: “When you attack us, you will see our faces. Not our backs.”

He had also posted a self-shot video earlier on Friday showing him and his key aides in the capital, rebuffing reports that he had fled Kyiv.

“We’re all here,” he said. “And it will stay this way.”","More images have now emerged of the apartment building near Kyiv’s Zhuliany airport that was struck by a missile earlier on Saturday.

We Urge Russia To ‘Pull Back’ On Ukraine Attacks – FG,"The Federal Government has called on the Russian troops to ‘pull back’ from its ‘aggressive’ attacks on Ukraine.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama said this on Friday at a press briefing in Abuja.

The Minister had earlier met with the envoys from various countries including the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Minister also met with the Ukrainian ambassador to Nigeria, Kirdoda Valerii, and his Russian counterpart, Alexei Shebarshin.

He said the Nigerian government during the meeting called for peace and the use of diplomacy in resolving differences between Russia and Ukraine.

“We made it clear that Nigeria does not condone this aggression and urged the Russians to pull back and stop the intervention. We have diplomatic relations with Ukraine. It’s a member of the United Nations, as well as Russia of course.

“We urge that peace be prioritised by the two sides and we are very sad that the diplomatic process that was ongoing before this attack was cut short.

“We support every effort being made to stop the aggression and that the Russian troops return to Russia.

“We recognise the sovereignty of Ukraine and the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” Onyeama said.

Russian President, Vladimir Putin, in the early hours of Thursday, ordered an invasion of Ukraine. The invasion was marked by shelling and rocket attacks on several Ukrainian major cities, including the capital, Kyiv.

Saturday marks the third day of the invasion where according to the Ukrainian Health Minister, 198 civilians including three children have been confirmed dead.

Russia also brushed off the barrage of Western sanctions and said it had fired cruise missiles at military targets.

According to NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, Ukrainian forces are putting up resistance and inflicting damage on Russia’s military as it seeks to push deeper into the country.","The Federal Government has called on the Russian troops to ‘pull back’ from its ‘aggressive’ attacks on Ukraine.
