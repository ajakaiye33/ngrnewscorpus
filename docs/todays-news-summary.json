    "summarized_story": "A group within the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) under the umbrella of Progressive Mandate Movement (PMM) has challenged Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to ensure that the party\u2019s national convention does not fail to hold by 5th of February, 2022.\nThe group also demanded immediate release of processes leading to the national convention, adding that if nothing is done by January 5th 2022, the National Secretariat will be made ungovernable for the CECPC.\nThe statement claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari had wanted the APC National Convention to hold in December 2021 but due to appeal by the Buni\u2019s CECPC, the presidency agreed to February 2022.\n\u201cThe delay in conducting the overdue APC national convention is already giving the opposition Peoples Democratic Party some advantages, making it look like nobody is in charge of the governing party.\n\u201cWe therefore call on Governor Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee not to go beyond February 5 to hold our party\u2019s National Convention."
