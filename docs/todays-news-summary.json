    "summarized_story": "President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed stated Monday that he is suspending Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble, widening the political schism between the country\u2019s top officials.\nAccording to a spokeswoman for President Mohamed, also known as Farmajo, the move was taken in response to an investigation into an illegal acquisition of public land involving Prime Minister Roble.\nThe prime minister accused Mohamed of obstructing parliamentary elections, prompting Roble\u2019s suspension.\nEarlier this year, the feuding leaders agreed to enable 101 delegates to choose members of parliament, who would then choose the future head of state.\nObservers fear that the feud between Farmajo and Roble will divert attention away from the ongoing threat posed by the al Shabab insurgent group, which has fought the central government in an attempt to seize power and impose sharia law in Somalia, which has been wracked by chaos and conflict since the overthrow of former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991."

    "summarized_story": "A group within the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) under the umbrella of Progressive Mandate Movement (PMM) has challenged Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to ensure that the party\u2019s national convention does not fail to hold by 5th of February, 2022.\nThe group also demanded immediate release of processes leading to the national convention, adding that if nothing is done by January 5th 2022, the National Secretariat will be made ungovernable for the CECPC.\nThe statement claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari had wanted the APC National Convention to hold in December 2021 but due to appeal by the Buni\u2019s CECPC, the presidency agreed to February 2022.\n\u201cThe delay in conducting the overdue APC national convention is already giving the opposition Peoples Democratic Party some advantages, making it look like nobody is in charge of the governing party.\n\u201cWe therefore call on Governor Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee not to go beyond February 5 to hold our party\u2019s National Convention."
