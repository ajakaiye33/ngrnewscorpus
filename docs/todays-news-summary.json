Commission (RMAFC) and the National Salaries, Incomes, and Wages Commission (NSIWC)to carry out their statutory duties by reviewing the remuneration and allowances of President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, 36 governors, and members of the National Assembly.\u201dSERAP is arguing that \u201cslashing jumbo pay for these high-ranking political office-holders would reduce the unfair pay disparity between political officer holders and judicial officers, address the persistent poor treatment of judges, and improve access of victims of corruption to justice and effective remedies.\u201dIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/658/2021 filed last Friday, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel the RMAFC to send its downward review of the remuneration and allowances of these high-ranking public office holders and recommendations to the National Assembly for appropriate remedial and legislative action, as provided for by the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended].\u201dSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel the RMAFC to perform its mandatory constitutional duty to urgently review upward the remuneration, salaries and allowances, as well as the conditions of service for Nigerian judges.\u201dRespondents in the suit include Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, and the National Judicial Council, acting individually and on behalf of all members of the Senate and House of Representatives.\nAdvertisementSERAP is arguing that: \u201cWhile high-ranking political office-holders continue to enjoy lavish allowances, including life pensions, and access to security votes, which they have powers to spend as they wish, the remuneration and allowances of judges are grossly insufficient to enable them to maintain themselves and their families in reasonable comfort.\u201dAccording to SERAP: \u201cThe huge pay disparity between these high-ranking political officer-holders and judges is unfair, unjust and discriminatory, especially given the roles of judges to the people and the country.\u201dSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel NSIWC to perform its mandatory legal duty to urgently examine, streamline and recommend upward remuneration and allowances of Nigerian judges, and to recommend downward review of allowances of President Buhari, Vice-President Osinbajo, 36 governors and lawmakers to the National Assembly.\u201dThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo, read in part: \u201cthe remuneration and allowances of judges have fallen substantially behind the average salaries and allowances of high-ranking political office-holders such as President, Vice-President, governors and lawmakers.\u201d\u201cWhile government reviewed upward the salaries and allowances of political office holders on four occasions between May 1999 and March 2011, the salaries and allowances of judicial officers were only reviewed twice during the same period.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cThe review of the remuneration, allowances, and conditions of service for political, public and judicial office holders carried out by the RMAFC in 2009 shows huge disparity between the remuneration and allowances of judges and those of high-ranking political office-holders.\u201d\u201cThe NSIWC in a letter to SERAP admitted that it has powers to examine, streamline and recommend the salary scales applicable to each post in the public service but informed us to redirect our request to the RMAFC.\u201d\u201cThere is a legal duty upon the RMAFC to urgently review downward the remuneration and allowances of high-ranking political office-holders.\u201dThe rather unfair treatment of members of the judiciary \u2013 being one of the three coordinate branches of the government \u2013 is akin to contempt.\nIt can be reasonably inferred that the judiciary are considered so unimportant by the political class, hence the refusal to pay them reasonable remuneration and allowances.\u201d\u201cJudges should get all to which they are reasonably entitled, and it is unfair, illegal, unconstitutional, and discriminatory to continue to treat judges as second-class people while high-ranking political office-holders continue to enjoy lavish salaries and allowances.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cDespite their important roles and responsibilities, Nigerian judges are poorly treated, particularly when their remuneration, salaries, allowances, and conditions of service are compared with that of political office-holders.\nJudges should not have to endure the most poignant financial worries.\u201d\u201cThe increase in the cost of living and the injustice of inadequate salaries bears heavily on judges, as it undermines their ability to effectively perform their judicial functions.\u201d\u201cThe roles and functions performed by judges across the country are second to none in their importance, including in facilitating access of v"
