    "summarized_story": "However, the question of who its members should settle for as the next national chairman of the APC, appears to be up in the air as Buhari was said to have denied endorsing anyone to lead the party for the next four years.\nBuhari\u2019s position contradicts earlier reports that he had endorsed former Governor Abdullahi Adamu of Nasarawa State to emerge as the next chairman of the APC.\nThose reported to have mounted pressure on the president to jettison Adamu as his preferred candidate for chairman are members of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change \u2013 one of the four political parties, which coalesced in 2013 to form the APC.\nPersons against the choice of Adamu would rather the contest for the post of chairman be thrown open, which will throw the zoning formula for the party\u2019s elective offices into disarray.\nTo discuss the recent turn of events in Nigeria\u2019s ruling party and what its members should be focused on in order to avoid the landmines that led to the PDP\u2019s implosion before the 2015 elections, is Senator Ali Ndume, the ranking senator representing Borno South in the National Assembly and former Senate Majority Leader."
