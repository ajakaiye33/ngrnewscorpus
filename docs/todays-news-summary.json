    "summarized_story": "Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday warned multilateral finance institutions against defunding oil and gas projects in Africa, as the Western World continues its drive to phase out polluting fuels, saying such a step would have medium and long term consequences on African economies.\nWe are emphatic in our view that natural gas, which Africa has in abundance, must be accepted as a transition fuel.\nThe vice president lamented that less than 10 per cent of African countries had vaccinated 40 per cent of their population.\nWe have to look at issues around patent rights, intellectual property rights, and exclusivity rights; especially if we\u2019re going to improve the chances of African countries to manufacture vaccines locally.\nBut we can\u2019t really talk about African countries producing their own vaccines if we don\u2019t address those important structural problems."
