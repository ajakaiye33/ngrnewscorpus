    "headline": "Tinubu: I Won\u2019t Decline Calls to Contest for Nigeria\u2019s Presidency",
    "summarized_story": "With deft political subtlety, a former governor of Lagos State and one of the national leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday, cleverly declared his decision to take his chances in the 2023 presidential election, saying he would not decline the many calls by supporters and admirers for him to contest.\nBy this statement, Tinubu has made it clear that his resolve to contest the 2023 presidential election was no longer in the realm of speculation, but when to officially declare, after he might have consulted widely and effectively as he stated explicitly.\nTinubu, who hinted at this in Abuja after a closed-door meeting with leaders of the Northern Alliance Committee (NAC), however, insisted he would still consult widely before finally declaring his intention for the 2023 presidential poll.\nI don\u2019t want to distract him from all the challenges he might face today.\nThe Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had in October inaugurated the South West Agenda 2023 (SWAGA \u201923), a political movement that has been mobilising support for Tinubu to throw his hat in the 2023 presidential ring."

    "headline": "Analysis: Why Buhari Will Sign Amended Electoral Bill Before Dec. 19",
    "summarized_story": "Although under intense pressure from different quarters, particularly governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari, might have resolved to sign the amended Electoral Bill, forwarded to him by the National Assembly on November 19.\nThe source explained, \u201cIt belies logic that the president would write to the National Assembly after they had proceeded on recess.\nHowever, despite our democratic achievements, Nigeria continues to face the challenge of insecurity, which poses a threat to our democracy.\nWhichever way this is programmed to swing, analysts have contended that the credibility and legacy of the president are at stake.\nHe would, therefore, have to choose between his own legacy and the need to please some vested interests."
