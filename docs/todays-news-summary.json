    "headline": "SERAP Sues Buhari Over $25bn Overdrafts Taken From CBN",
    "summarized_story": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit, asking the court \u201cto compel President Muhammadu Buhari to disclose spending details of the overdrafts and loans obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) since May 29, 2015, including the projects on which the overdrafts have been spent, and repayments of all overdrafts to date.\u201dSERAP is also seeking an order to compel the president to \u201cexplain and clarify whether the $25bn (N9.7trn) overdraft reportedly obtained from the CBN is within the five-percent limit of the actual revenue of the government for 2020.\u201dThe suit followed SERAP\u2019s Freedom of Information (FoI) request to President Buhari, stating that: \u201cDisclosing details of overdrafts and repayments would enable Nigerians to hold the government to account for its fiscal management and ensure that public funds are not mismanaged or diverted.\u201dIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/559/2021 filed last week at the Federal High Court, Abuja, SERAP is also seeking: \u201can order directing and compelling President Buhari to disclose details of overdrafts taken from the CBN by successive governments between 1999 and 2015.\u201dREAD ALSO: Bandits Kill Seven, Kidnap 10 In Fresh Kaduna AttacksIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that: \u201cSecrecy and the lack of public scrutiny of the details of CBN overdrafts and repayments is antithetical to the public interest, the common good, the country\u2019s international legal obligations, and a fundamental breach of constitutional oath of office.\u201dJoined in the suit as respondents are the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN; the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed; and the Governor of CBN, Godwin Emefiele.\nSERAP is also arguing that: \u201cEnsuring transparency and accountability in the spending of CBN overdrafts and loans would promote prudence in debt management, reduce any risks of corruption and mismanagement, and help the government to avoid the pitfalls of excessive debt.\u201dAccording to SERAP: \u201cBy the combined reading of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), the Freedom of Information Act, the UN Convention against Corruption, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, there are transparency obligations imposed on the government to disclose information to the public concerning details of CBN overdrafts, loans and repayments to date.\u201dSERAP is also arguing that: \u201cThe Nigerian Constitution, Freedom of Information Act, and these treaties rest on the basic principle that citizens should have access to information regarding their government\u2019s activities.\u201dThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo, read in part: \u201cTransparency and accountability in the spending of CBN overdrafts would also ensure that public funds are properly spent, reduce the level of public debt, and improve the ability of the government to invest in essential public goods and services, such as quality education, healthcare, and clean water.\u201d\u201cIt is the primary responsibility of the government to ensure public access to these services in order to lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\u201d\u201cTransparency and accountability in the spending of CBN overdrafts and loans would also improve the ability of the government to effectively respond to the COVID-19 crisis.\nThis means that the government would not have to choose between saving lives or making debt payments.\u201d\u201cThe recent overdraft of $25.6bn (about N9.7trn) reportedly obtained from the CBN would appear to be above the five-percent limit of the actual revenue of the Federal Government for 2020, that is, N3.9trn, prescribed by Section 38(2) of the CBN Act 2007.\nSERAP notes that five-percent of N3.9trn is N197bn.\u201d\u201cWhile Section 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the Bank to grant overdrafts to the Federal Government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, sub-section 2 provides that any outstanding overdraft \u2018shall not exceed five-percent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the Federal Government.\u2019\u201d\u201cSimilarly, Section 38(3) requires all overdrafts to \u2018be repaid as soon as possible and by the end of the financial year in which the overdrafts are granted.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe CBN is prohibited from granting any further overdrafts until all outstanding overdrafts have been fully repaid.\nUnder the CBN Act, \u2018no repayment shall take the form of a promising note or such other promise to pay at a future date, treasury bills, bonds or other forms of security which is required to be underwritten by the Bank.\u2019\u201d\u201cSimilarly, the Fiscal Responsibility Act provides in section 41 that the government \u2018shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development.\u2019 Under the Act, the government \u2018shall ensure that the level of public debt as a proportion of national income is held at a sustainable level.\u2019\u201d\u201cSection 44 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act requires the government to specify the purpos"
