Lifu also restrained the respondents from \u201cforceful imposition, collection of any transport union levies, dues, fees or money from any person, commercial driver or any transporter that is not a member of the respondents.\u201d\n\nThe suit was filed by Ogungbeje on behalf of himself and the Transport Union Society of Nigeria.\n\nListed as respondents in the suit were the Lagos State Government; its attorney general, the Registered Trustees of the National Union of Road Transport Workers; the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria; the National Association of Road Transport Owners and the newly appointed Head of the Lagos State Park and Garages Management, Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo; and others.\n\nOgungbeje, in a June 2, 2022 letter to the Commissioner of Police in Lagos, lamented that the respondents had not complied with the court order, saying collection of levy by the respondents had continued unhindered despite the court order.\n\nHis letter, obtained by Saturday PUNCH on Friday, was titled, \u201cStrong Demand for Immediate Compliance and Enforcement of the Order of Court Against NURTW, RTEAN, NARTO and Lagos State Government without any further delay.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer warned the parties involved to obey the order of the court before June 8, 2022, or risk mass action by Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is utterly preposterous and alarming that despite the valid and subsisting order of the court, the affected transport unions, cited persons and indeed the Lagos State Government have continued to treat the order of the court with flagrant disdain as if they are above the law by their continuous extortion and/or collection of the restrained levies, taxes, dues and or money from commercial transport drivers and riders in Lagos without qualms.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, we are using this medium to strongly call and beckon on you to use your good offices to ensure that the affected transport unions, persons and authorities comply with the order, so as to forestall a breakdown of law and order in Lagos State.

          "text": "Presidential aspirant and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, says he has great respect for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and he will never denigrate him.\n\nTinubu said this in a statement personally signed by him on Friday, just a day after declaring openly in Abeokuta, Ogun State, that without his efforts Buhari would never have become President in 2015.\n\nTinubu, who was in Ogun State to solicit support of party members for his presidential ambition, recalled how Buhari had, out of frustration, broken down in tears on television, declaring he was done trying to become President after failing for the third time.\n\n\u201cIf not me that led the war front, Buhari would not have emerged. He contested first, second and third times, but lost. He even wept on television, declaring that he would not contest again.\n\n\u201cBut I went to his home in Katsina; I told him you would contest and win, but \u2018you would not joke with Yoruba matters\u2019.\n\n\u201cSince he has emerged, I have not been appointed minister. I didn\u2019t get a contract.\n\n\u201cThis time, it\u2019s the Yoruba\u2019s turn and in Yorubaland, it\u2019s my tenure,\u201d Tinubu had declared.\n\nHis declaration had gone viral, generating controversies.\n\nBut in his statement on Friday, titled, \u201cI have high regard and respect for President Buhari,\u201d Tinubu blamed the controversies trailing his comment on alleged willful misrepresentation of what he said by his political opponents, who \u201chopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary.\u201d\n\nTinubu said his Thursday\u2019s statement, in which he also disclosed that he nominated Prof Yemi Osinbajo as Buhari\u2019s running mate, was so that \u201ctruth and accuracy may have a chance.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand. Whatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\n\u201cThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sections of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent, given that I spoke in Yoruba. Those who do not understand the nuances of this richly-layered and subtly language may have inadvertently, yet erroneously, missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement.\n\n\u201cInstead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\u201d\n\nTinubu said, contrary to the expectation of his adversaries, he believed that as an experienced and accomplished leader, Buhari would not be taken by the tricks of his opponents.\n\n\u201cLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in-Chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him.\n\n\u201cI certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that our partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardise it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over,\u201d Tinubu added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The money was shared between North and Southern parts of the State.\n\n\u201cRelevant stakeholders like Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), development associations, NGOs, SOKAPU as well as local government areas.\n\n\u201cIn Southern Kaduna 148 communities have been displaced and no fewer than 200,000 persons displaced. Some of them in IDPs camps and many others squatting with their relations.\n\n\u201cThis intervention will also get to the families of who have helped the displaced persons one way or the other.\n\n\u201cOn this note we want to commend governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for his magnanimity. We pray to God to guide and protect him.\n\n\u201cIt is unbelievable that of all the presidential Aspirants that came to Kaduna to campaign it was only governor Wike of Rivers that remembered to donate to the IDPs. May God continue to bless him and refund him abundantly.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on all good spirited individuals, organisations and international bodies to come to the aid of the displaced persons in the State, especially in Southern Kaduna where we have huge humanitarian crisis. Humanitarian intervention is needed here.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on both the Federal and State governments to intervene by creating Southern Kaduna Development Commission to help in addressing the humanitarian crisis in the area.\n\n\u201cAs for the relief materials, we just did a symbolic distribution, but by the time we are doing the full distribution, every party involved will be represented, and the distribution will be strictly supervised by SOKAPU,\u201d he said.",

Local Government Areas, being the closest to the people, thus remain the engine room of multi-party democratic engagement.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Party Secretariats in all the constituent LGAs in Edo South must remain at the cutting-edge in the institutionalization of internal governance structures.\n\n\u201cA key starting point for achieving this objective is for the party Secretariats at the local levels to be well furnished,\u201d Dr Owie stated.\n\n\u201cIn the course of our interactions with stakeholders across the Senatorial District over the past 20+ months, the non-availability of efficient meeting spaces and supporting infrastructure have been an embarrassingly apparent pain-point for both party members and the leadership across the board.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that resources available to leadership of the party are becoming increasingly finite, we thought it expedient to support, to the fullest possible extent, collective efforts being made to re-position the Party, in Edo South.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this donation will mark the end of renting of chairs, etc , for Party meetings.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that these tents have been made from recycled PVC material in line with our commitment to mainstreaming Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) considerations in all our engagements with the leadership of the party, stakeholders and the larger society.\n\n\u201cWe thank the indefatigable National Vice Chairman of the PDP in the South-South and Chairman Emeritus of Edo PDP, Chief Dan Osi Orbih, for providing exemplary leadership in times of extreme crisis. We also thank the Chairman and Members of the State Working Committee, the State Vice Chairman (Edo South) and all the LGA Chairmen in the District for making sacrifices to keep the Party united and resilient.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of the Chairmen, Iseleromon Nosa Osaro, Chairman of PDP Uhunmwode LGA who also doubles as the Chairman of the Caucus of PDP Chairmen in Edo State, thanked Dr Owie for his kind gestures and prayed the good Lord to continually bless him.\n\nHe stated that the LGA Chapters in the Senatorial District have never witnessed support and solidarity of this nature in the recent past. Other chairmen also joined him in thanking Dr Owie for his magnanimity.",

          "title": "I\u2019ll accept outcome of free and fair APC Presidential primaries \u2014 Tinubu",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe\n\nFRONTLINE President Aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has pooh-poohed those he accused of misrepresenting his statement in Abeokuta on Thursday to pit him against President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nNoting that he has high regards for President Buhari, the former Lagos State Governor said he would not denigrate Buhari or the office he seeks to occupy.\n\nHe added that he would accept the outcome of free and fair presidential primaries whether he won or lost.\n\nTinubu while addressing APC delegates in Ogun reportedly said among others that he deployed his resources to make Buhari president in 20215, a comment that elicited sharp criticisms, yesterday.\n\n\u201cHowever, in a statement he signed himself, Tinibu said: \u201cWe have entered the meat of primary season. Sensationalism and wilful inaccuracy tend to push aside truth during such moments. I make this statement so that truth and accuracy may have a chance. It is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand. Whatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\n\u201cThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sections of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba. Those who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement. Instead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\n\u201cAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary. President Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people.\n\n\u201cLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in-Chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since. When I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of his presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would asperse the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\n\u201cIn Abeokuta, I spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair. There are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories. Now that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in. \u201cHowever, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is a Nigerian patriot, a man of integrity. These qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019. I am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\nI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own right. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\n\n\u201cMy aspiration to be President of Nigeria is based on my want to serve the nation and not that I feel some personal entitlement to high office. Governance of this nation is a sacred and solemn duty. It is neither to be given as a favour to someone who is unqualified nor should people be motivated by personal reasons to prevent the most qualified person from attaining the office. The wellbeing of over 200 million souls is at stake. Let us all realise this and act accordingly, I only desire a level-playing ground for all aspirants and an adherence to stipulated rules and due process. If in the fairness of such a process, I do not emerge as the party\u2019s candidate, I shall have no complaints regarding an honest primary and will accept the fair outcome as a true democrat.\u201d",

          "text": "Operatives of the Lagos Police Command on Thursday afternoon rescued three scavengers from being lynched to death after they allegedly murdered a man, Gideon Sylvester, 20.\n\nThe trio attracted the wrath of a lunching mob along Beach Road, Jakande in Lekki, after Sylvester was stabbed in the neck following a disagreement.\n\nIt was learnt that they were picking condemned metals when Sylvester allegedly challenged them, which led to a fight. In the course of the fight, one of the boys allegedly stabbed him with a knife in the neck, causing him to bleed to death.\n\nSensing that they had killed him, the three young men were said to have fled the scene but were pursued by onlookers who caught and beat them up and attempted to set them ablaze.\n\nFortunately, policemen from Maroko Division raced to the scene and rescued the three suspects from the mob. While two of them were said to have been unconscious, the third identified as Mudasa, who sustained injuries, was treated and handed over to the police.\n\nRead Also: Mob kills female student over alleged blasphemy in Sokoto college\n\nSpokesman for the command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the incident, adding that once the other suspects were revived, they would also be detained for the alleged murder crime.\n\nHe however explained that preliminary investigation showed that one of the three suspects was actually an innocent passerby who got caught up in the melee.\n\nHundeyin said: \u201cThe incident was reported via a distress call around 2:50pm on Thursday. A team of policemen were mobilised to the scene where three boys were about to be burnt and they were rescued and rushed to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cOne of the suspects who was treated and discharged revealed that they stabbed Gideon because someone also injured one of them in the head.\n\n\u201cThe mob also went to the boys\u2019 shade and set it ablaze. The area has been stabilised and everything is back to normal. Policemen are still patrolling the area. Of the three boys that were about to be burnt, one has been taken to the hospital and discharged and currently in the police station as a suspect.\n\n\u201cThe remaining two in the hospital, one is a suspect, the other was just a victim of circumstance not a suspect.\n\n\u201cOnce he (suspect) is discharged, he will be handed over to the police so that they can be handed over to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) for further investigation.\n\n\u201cThe command will not tolerate acts of violence and residents are urged to shun jungle justice.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFew days to the all-important Special Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to elect its presidential candidate, confusion and anxiety has continued to reign supreme both in the camps of the aspirants and the national secretariat of the party.\n\nThe apprehension is not unconnected with the recent report the presidential screening committee submitted to the party\u2019s national leadership on Friday, which disqualified no fewer than 10 of the aspirants, clearing 13 out of the 23 that purchased the party\u2019s N100 million expression of interest and nomination forms. Fresh facts however emerged within the week that 17 of the Progressive governors have agreed to support whoever preferred aspirant President Buhari presents.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSaturday Sun further gathered that two governors from North West rejected the idea of President Buhari picking one aspirant for endorsement outright, even as two South West governors and one other from the North West are sitting on the fence on the matter.\n\nOur sources also disclosed that there is a 50-50 chance that the three governors who are neutral now may go either way, adding: \u201cIt is expected that by Sunday, the preferred aspirant would be unveiled to the governors, ahead of the Monday, June 6, 2022 special national convention.\u201d\n\nAlthough the party had commenced activities for the conduct of the presidential primary activities scheduled to hold between Monday to Wednesday, with the composition of various committees, the aspirants have been in the dark over how the candidate of the party will emerge.\n\nHowever, while the permutations have continued to favour one aspirant or the other, the recent appeal from President Muhammadu Buhari to the Progressive Governors to allow him anoint the party\u2019s candidate contributed in escalating the apprehension of the aspirants.\n\nIn fact, the appeal from President Buhari was yet to sink well in the minds of many of the aspirants when the John Odigie-Oyegun-led screening committee released the satanic report, disqualifying former President Goodluck Jonathan on the grounds that he did not appear before it for screening, among nine others whose identities were yet to be revealed.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with members of Progressive Governors Forum in Abuja, President Buhari had told them that he would want to pick his successor, urging the governors to give him their support.\n\nExpectedly, the appeal from the President, the disagreement over zoning and consensus have sharply divided the ranks of the governors, with 17 of them backing Buhari on his preferred aspirant.\n\nA top source close to the governors told Saturday Sun that the those proposing zoning had insisted that if the ticket must be zoned to the North, then it must be micro-zoned to the North East, or to the South East if it must be zoned to the South, hinging the choice of the two zones on fairness and equity since they have not produced president in the past.\n\nAlthough Odigie-Oyegun did not reveal the identity of the disqualified aspirants, there are strong indications that the committee laid emphasis on the agility, capability and age of the aspirants.\n\nSpeaking while submitting the report, Oyegun said: \u201cEvery single aspirant that presented himself qualified because it was basis and simple. But we are the governing party and we are keen on continuing the process of replacing, at proper time, our president with another member of the party and so the ability to lead, your background, your experience, your understanding of the Nigerian situation, your ideas as to how issues, difficulties and the rest can be addressed and how the country can move forward to begin a critical consideration.\n\n\u201cIt is on that basis we made our final shortlist. I don\u2019t want to read the names, I think I would leave that to you (Chairman), but we have a shortlist which brought the number severely down to 13. We could have cut it a little shorter, but we wanted deliberately the younger elements to surface for them to be seen, for them to be noticed and no noise. We would hand them over to the party and it is for the party to decide whom their candidate will be.\n\nSpeaking further, Oyegun said: \u201cOne thing I have to emphasize is: we engage every aspirant on the issue of consensus and it was a pleasant surprise that 99 per cent agreed that the party is supreme and whatever the party finally decides with proper consultations, they were likely to accept.\u201d\n\nAsked whether former President Jonathan appeared before his committee, he said: \u201cNo, Jonathan did not appear.\u201d\n\nResponding, the party\u2019s national chairman, Adamu, warned the aspirants that the decision of the party is very supreme, urging them to abide by whatever outcome.\n\nCuriously, protesters, seeking one form of attention or the other from the national leadership of the party, held the national secretariat of the ruling party, in Abuja, in the early hours of Friday, practically to a standstill.\n\nAlthough former President Jonathan was technically missing in the list of the aspirants cleared, the protesters under the platform of Goodluck Jonathan Support Group had stormed the party\u2019s national secretariat, drumming and dancing for hours. While the pro-Jonathan protesters were still disrupting activities, another group of protesters from Abia State had joined them to inform the leadership that they were not in support of the primaries conducted in the state that produced some of the candidates of the party for next year\u2019s elections.\n\nComplicating the situation, a colony of Persons Living with Disability equally arrived the secretariat to drum support for the presidential aspiration of the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello.\n\nWhile the protest lasted, vehicular and human movement was grounded, making impossible for those on genuine mission at the secretariat to gain entrance.\n\nEarlier around 10.30am, the leadership of the party had beefed up security, deploying more police and other security personnel in anticipation of a possible breakdown of law and order in the secretariat.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nOmotoso urged Okada riders to embrace the many alternative modes of transportation provided by the government, as there were plans to inject more First and Last Mile buses into the metropolis.He said that in the first four months of 2022, the state recorded 1,712 accidents, 767 of which were caused by Okada, resulting in death. He said 45 per cent of the riders were youths between 30 and 39 years.\n\n\u2018\u2019So, taking Okada off the roads is helping our young ones to stay alive, it is not hurting our people. We are not leaving them to their own devices and so we have said anyone who is interested in doing a decent business can form cooperative and join the First and Last Mile bus scheme.\n\n\u201cThey can present their proposals to the State\u2019s Employment Trust Fund and get money to fund their businesses. We have vocational centres where they can learn a trade and start a new life. So, anyone saying Okada is the only way to earn a living in Lagos is not doing any good,\u2019\u2019 the commissioner said. Also speaking at the event, Shola Jejeloye, the chairman, Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Taskforce) disclosed that there is 85 per cent compliance on Okada ban in the last three days. He said that the enforcement of the ban would continue so as to ensure sanity of the environment.\n\nAccording to him, the enforcement of the ban did not just begin on Wednesday, June 1, but has been in force since Feb. 1, 2020.\n\nJejeloye said that there was no going back on enforcement of Okada ban, as government does not make mockery of its policies and decisions.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Saraki, in a statement signed by the head of his Media Office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in response to the speech by Tinubu in Abeokuta on Thursday claiming that Saraki and others opposed his desire to be running mate to President Mohammadu Buhari in the 2015 elections, noted that he will oppose any plan that causes a religious crisis in a multi-religious country like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen I and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014 stood against having a Muslim-Muslim ticket, it was not a decision targeted at any individual or group but one taken in the national interest. Asiwaju knows this and he is just being mischievous by presenting this decision as something aimed at stopping his ambition.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that the decision to oppose the plans by some people to make APC present a Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2015 was in the national interest and I will take the same stand today, tomorrow, and any other day.

It is a decision which served the purpose of the people of Nigeria and I have no regret supporting it,\u201d Saraki stated.\n\nWhile expressing surprise that Tinubu refused to move on and still sulked over what happened in 2014, the former Governor of Kwara State added that the APC presidential aspirant had become so fixated on the Muslim-Muslim ticket issue of 2014 that he worked so hard to stop the emergence of Saraki as Senate President in a move he considered as retaliatory. Saraki also stated that after he was elected Senate President, Tinubu maintained an adversarial position against the eighth National Assembly, initiated covert and overt measures aimed at undermining the federal legislature, and set the executive against the legislature.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Analysts are of the view that Tinubu may have decided to go for broke, after sensing he may be losing the opportunity to achieve his \u2018lifelong ambition\u2019 to be president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe outburst in Abeokuta today is a sign of frustration with the refusal of President Buhari to endorse him publicly. It is significant that he said what he said in the home state of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, another frontline contender for the APC ticket\u201d, an observer who pleaded anonymity noted.\n\nTinubu\u2019s assertions came as Osinbajo hosted the national chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and five governors of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nHowever, the governors said they would convey their collective decision regarding suggestions on Buhari\u2019s successor to the president today or tomorrow.\n\nBut former President of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN), faulted Buhari\u2019s recent request to be allowed to choose his successor, describing it as patently unconstitutional and akin to a coup d\u2019etat.\n\n\n\nTinubu, who visited Ogun State in continuation of his tour to persuade delegates ahead of the APC presidential primary, declared that he facilitated the ascension of Buhari, Osinbajo, and Abiodun to their current positions.\n\nAccompanied on the tour by a retinue of serving and former governors, ministers, deputy governors, senators, and a host of others, Tinubu said he was making the revelations for the first time because there was need for him to talk.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf not for me talking to you today, Buhari would not have been president. It is over 25 years that I have been serving them. This one sitting behind me, Dapo Abiodun, he could not become the governor without me.\n\n\u201cSince the time we started with the Action Congress (AC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), and now, the All Progressives Congress (APC), I wanted to contest for president since those times.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is me telling you between my life and God Almighty, Buhari called me to be his vice president. He said because the first time he contested, he picked Okadigbo, flamboyant, Catholic, but Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him.\n\n\u201cThe second time, he picked another Igbo, Ume Ezeoke, Nigerians didn\u2019t vote for him; that if he goes to bring the Pope to run as his vice, Nigerians won\u2019t vote for him, but you, Bola Tinubu, you have six governors, you have never lost an election before, come and be my vice.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe knew all the calculations then favoured us, that was why he wanted me as his vice, but I told him to let us build the party first. And when we finished building the party, after we brought in people from the PDP, Saraki now saw that those from the PDP will not get anything if Buhari, a Muslim, becomes the president and me, also a Muslim, becomes his vice, he won\u2019t get the senate president and the senate president cannot also be a Muslim, that was how they started the campaign of calumny against me.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I told them that I have a candidate that is a Christian that I can nominate so that the party will not break, that was how I nominated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. I surrendered my right to him (Osinbajo).\n\n\n\n\u201cI was asked to submit three names: Yemi Cardozo, Wale Edun, and Yemi Osinbajo, but I said that if I submitted three names, it is like opening your door for a thief. They may add the fourth name and choose that one. So, I insisted on only one name. You are hearing this thing from me for the first time.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is my time. I\u2019m educated, I\u2019m experienced. I have been serving you for a long time, bring me the presidency, it is my turn. When Atiku was being flogged out of the PDP by Obasanjo, he ran to me for help, I got the ticket for him. Nuhu Ribadu came to me and I backed him.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been over 25 years now that I have been serving them.\n\nThis one sitting behind me, Dapo, can he say he can be the governor without me? We were together at the MKO Abiola Stadium, he was intimidated, they didn\u2019t want to give him the party\u2019s flag. I was the one that handed the flag to him. He knows that he cannot be the governor without the help of God and my support.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf not for me that stood behind Buhari, he wouldn\u2019t have become the president. He tried the first time, he failed, the second time, he failed, the third time, he failed. He even wept on national television and vowed never to contest again but I went to meet him in Kaduna and told him he will run again; I will stand by you and you will win, but you must not joke with Yorubas and he agreed.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince he became the president, I have never got ministerial slots, I didn\u2019t collect any contract, I have never begged for anything from him, it is the turn of Yoruba; it is my turn.\u201d\n\nTinubu, therefore, asked Ogun State delegates to vote for him at the forthcoming primary of the party, saying,\n\n\u201cPlease, stand by me, you delegates that are here, from Ogun State, you shall not become delicates. Don\u2019t be carried away by \u2018he is our son\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponding, Abiodun said the people had listened to Tinubu and heard all he said. The governor described Tinubu as a fighter, bold strategist, mentor, and dogged politician.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of our nation. We shall do the needful and will justify why power must come to the South-west.\u201d\n\n\n\nOsinbajo Meets APC Chairman, 5 Governors\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, played host to the chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and five governors.\n\nAdamu led the governors, whose identities could not be immediately ascertained, to the meeting with the vice president at the Akinola Aguda official residence of Osinbajo within the precincts of the State House, Abuja.\n\nAlthough the agenda of the meeting was not made public, there were speculations it might not be unconnected with the presidential primary of APC, scheduled to commence on Monday, June 6.\n\n\n\nSources told THISDAY that the meeting might have discussed the consensus option being canvassed by Buhari.\n\nAttempts to access the vice president\u2019s official residence on Thursday evening was refused by security men, who claimed they were on instruction not to allow anybody in, except on invitation.\n\nEfforts to also get information on the outcome of the meeting from the media aide to the vice president, Laolu Akande, also hit a brick wall, as he neither picked calls nor replied text messages.\n\nAPC Governors to Convey Their Suggestion to Buhari Today\n\nGovernors of the ruling APC resolved to convey their proposal on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor to him when he returns from Madrid. This followed their meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, one of the presidential hopefuls of the party, which held Wednesday night, ahead of Buhari\u2019s return to the country today.\n\nA presidential aide told THISDAY that the meeting centred around the party\u2019s presidential primary slated for next week Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAt the meeting, which lasted till 3am on Thursday, Osinbajo was said to have passionately appealed to the governors to see him as someone that could be trusted with the APC ticket, and one capable of winning the election for the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThe meeting also came at a time when there was apparent pressure on one of the national leaders of APC, Bola Tinubu, to shelve his presidential ambition.\n\n\n\nAPC sources confirmed that the Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, one of Tinubu\u2019s close allies, was directed to have a word with him, in an attempt to advise Tinubu to align with the president\u2019s decision to pick a nominee of his choice as the party\u2019s candidate for next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\n\nA party source told THISDAY that only a few governors of the party were opposed to the president\u2019s resolve to choose a successor. This was confirmed by a senior party official, who craved anonymity, but disclosed that since the meeting, most APC governors loyal to the president had visited the State House to affirm their readiness to work with Buhari\u2019s candidate.\n\n\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe governors on their own decided to go and discuss the matter and promised Mr. President they will revert. After a long meeting into the night, they resolved to adjourn; at that point, the majority were ready to align with Mr. President.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince after the meeting, many of the governors have been coming to the villa one by one to express readiness to work with Mr. President\u2019s choice. They will all report their decision to the president anytime from tomorrow. Everyone of them already knows who the president is talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe presidential aide said Buhari had taken his decision and was not ready to go back on it.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe president has said his mind and the governors know what is at stake at this moment. He was even democratic in his approach not to have put it straight to them that this was his candidate, like others would have done.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ganduje, to the best of my knowledge, has been asked to speak with Tinubu to drop his ambition for the sake of peace and progress of the party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nOlawale Olaleye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Monday, tinkered with the mood in his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and, indeed, the nation, when he hinted at the possibility of a consensus in the choice of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nBuhari had at a meeting with the 22 governors of the party, in the presence of the National Chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, cleverly stated that he wanted \u201creciprocity\u201d in the process leading to the choice of his successor.\n\nHe simply asked to be allowed to determine who the fellow would be, as the governors, (so it was presumed), too, determined successors in their respective states.\n\n\n\nThe idea of seeking to be allowed to determine his successor did not come about by chance. The president was believed to have been mulling his options and, especially, how to go about it in the past few weeks.\n\nSources within the party had also hinted of a discreet committee long set up by the president to look at the options before him from the array of aspirants currently jostling to fly the flag of the ruling APC.\n\nThe committee, which sources claimed, had long submitted its report, did so with some of the options deemed suitable from the lot and also offered explanation on each, allegedly.\n\n\n\nWhile the sources declined to divulge the options presented to the president and why, the Monday meeting during which the president hinted at a possible consensus, was a follow-up to the committee report and, by extension, a clue on what would happen next week, when APC holds its presidential convention.\n\n\n\nVery importantly, too, Buhari\u2019s meeting with the governors, which held on a day the screening of the presidential aspirants of the party came to a close, was considered strategic to send home the right message. This is more so, as one critical question asked the aspirants during screening was what their reaction would be if the party embraced the consensus option for its primary election.\n\n\n\nSince Buhari dropped the bombshell, shortly before departing for Madrid, Spain, on an official visit, discussions have continued almost endlessly, as to who his choice might be, even though he would not pick outside of the 22 men and a woman screened by the committee led by a former national chairman of the party and erstwhile governor of Edo State, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun.\n\n\n\nBut Buhari, typically, has managed to keep sealed lips, while keeping everyone guessing and the nation in suspense. Buhari\u2019s choice is today the best kept secret, as no one can claim knowledge of the choice.\n\nFor a while, former President Goodluck Jonathan seemed like the beautiful bride. And with an eagle eye, the press kept vigil and made headlines of any scrap of information from that camp. But events that have played out thus far, have excluded him as a tantalising prospect. Could it still be him? Well, not that it\u2019s just impossible, but it is now highly improbable.\n\n\n\nYet, if Jonathan was out of the race or was never in it in the first place, these men are not. The president is believed to have narrowed his choice to these 10 men from the 23 aspirants. They are Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo, Ibikunle Amosun, Kayode Fayemi, Chibuike Amaechi, Godswill Akpabio, Ken Nnamani, Ogbonnaya Onu, Ahmed Lawan, and Abubakar Badaru.\n\n\n\nThis, however, is notwithstanding the new thinking in the party, which seeks to broaden the space to allow for more options before the party journeys to its presidential convention next Monday, even though stakeholders are still sharply divided over zoning of the party\u2019s ticket in order to face the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\n\nBut the question remains: who amongst these men will Buhari pick? Who is the president\u2019s choice hiding in plain sight? In 72 hours or less, the nation shall know that which is hidden in the mind of the president.\n\nBelow are the possible contenders profiled in no particular order.\n\nBola Tinubu\n\nTheir paths to a promising political partnership first crossed in the run-up to the 2011 general election, when an alliance was proposed between Buhari and Tinubu, including running on a joint ticket, although a Muslim-Muslim blend. But the intrigues of that era were a bit too much for their proposal to fly and so, the idea was rested.\n\nIt was, therefore, not difficult to pick up from where they stopped, when the lead up to the 2015 elections also demanded some kind of partnership, stronger than the alliance proposed in 2011. Tinubu provided the grounds for the merger and joined other forces to raise the team that sent an incumbent government packing.\n\n\n\nAlthough Tinubu came to the merger with the mindset of the 2011 understanding of paring with Buhari, what was at stake in 2015 was bigger than the minced meat of 2011. So that understanding died a natural death. But Tinubu would not stop talking about it and if he ever falls in the consideration of Buhari, it would be a compensation for his lifelong ambition.\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nTheir first ever meeting was the night he was introduced to him as his co-pilot for the Nigerian project. He could barely even remember his name in their first-ever outing together after that, when he erroneously referred to his running mate as \u201cOsinbande\u201d during an introduction. But seven years after, all that is history.\n\n\n\nAs dependable allies, Buhari and Osinbajo, have walked through the thick and thin of addressing many of Nigeria\u2019s challenges. In his capacity as vice president, he has stepped forward to the demands of his office without reservation from any quarters. As acting president, Osinbajo made good the opportunities, which came a couple of times, to prove the stuff he is made of.\n\n\n\nTherefore, after almost eight years together as a seemingly indivisible duo, Osinbajo ordinarily stands out as a good successor, who would easily sell the agenda of the ruling party. But there are much deeper considerations beyond being his current deputy and this would be part of the factors to juggle, when his name eventually comes up.\n\nIbikunle Amosun\n\nHis relationship with Buhari comes in two parts. One, as family and, two, as political ally. But he is closer as an adopted member of the Buhari family, who has been with him for many years. No doubt, he is the closest to Buhari in the South-west. Little wonder, he is the only \u201cstranger\u201d allowed to see Buhari\u2019s surviving sister. The two also flaunt their relationship without minding whose ox is gored.\n\n\n\nAmosun has often taken it upon himself to do some political clean-up for the president, evidently, without prodding. It is personal for him. Even more, as a two-term governor of Ogun State, a state he rescued from the throes of economic and social maladies, Amosun\u2019s management of security in the state at a time banks could not open for business for fear of robbers and how he marked up the state\u2019s IGR are clear indications of capacity, competence, and ability to think outside the box.\n\n\n\nWhichever angle his consideration comes from as Buhari\u2019s likely choice, Amosun stands firm and able to take up the challenge, of course, with the support of the party and other stakeholders.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nTelling the story of the formation of the APC and the young men, who burnt their energies to make it happen, without acknowledging the role Fayemi played would be history in poor revision. From how the name, APC, came about to the first announcement that introduced the \u201cbaby party\u201d to the people of Nigeria, whoever is writing the story of the APC would not be seen as having done justice to it without properly documenting how Fayemi fared.\n\nFrom his appointment as Minister of Steel, to his current office as not just the governor of Ekiti State, but also the governor of governors, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Fayemi has helped both Buhari and the party to manage his colleagues, to the admiration of the president, without crossing the lines on either side.\n\n\n\nA progressive, young and promising mind, Fayemi\u2019s development focus puts him in good stead. That\u2019s in addition to sound academic background and choice of war studies for his PhD study, which are indications of palpable competence and capacity to cause change to happen. Thinking Fayemi, clearly, puts these and more into account.\n\nChibuike Amaechi\n\nThe former Rivers State governor wormed his way to the heart of the president long before the election of 2015. Based on personal conviction, even though he had no clue what the future held for him, Amaechi had told everyone, who cared to listen that the only person, who could win the election for APC was Buhari. His conviction was further given fillip by two things: the need to fight corruption and insecurity.\n\n\n\nThus, Amaechi, working with like-minds, went all out and gave everything, even at personal expense, to make sure Buhari emerged, not just as the candidate of APC at its 2014 presidential convention in Lagos, but also emerged victorious at the general election.\n\n\n\nAside boasting enviable record, both as governor and Minister of Transportation, Amaechi, also has to his credit, the experience of having managed his colleagues at the level of speaker and as governor of governors for eight years. This puts him, too, in a vantage position. And as one of those who have done the administration proud with his railway revolution, he is standing pretty strong in the current equation.\n\nGodswill Akpabio\n\nWearing the badge of uncommon transformation as governor of Akwa Ibom State for eight years, the immediate past Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, is the second person, aside Amaechi, from the South-south, who is being penciled in for the job of the president as a result of the current confusion in APC.\n\n\n\nAlthough a second-class APC member by reason of the time he joined the party, Akpabio is also a latecomer to the \u201cconference of presidential aspirants\u201d owing to the time he enlisted in the race. But, as a lawyer with potential for political novelties, he has claimed a slot in the race, as the party and president struggle to pick a consensus candidate acceptable to all.\n\n\n\nWith these in view, Akpabio is another South-south possibility, should Buhari resolve to go to the oil producing part of the country, as part of the balancing act to even out the power equation.\n\nKen Nnamani\n\nVery few people from the South-east enjoy the kind of admiration that the former senate president gets from the president. Buhari is said to have a thing for him, especially, his maturity and capacity to manage people and relationships, irrespective of their contrasting dispositions.\n\n\n\nCuriously, his tenure as senate president has remained one abiding testimonial that he takes about. He stood against the alleged third term agenda of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and followed it up till the federal legislature killed it and paved the way for the 2007 elections.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the debate about his knowledge of the country does not arise, if the ability to manage his colleagues, is a factor to reckon. And coming from the South-east, which is desperately seeking to produce the president in the interest of equity, justice and fairness, Nnamani is not standing badly in the consideration, if the dice rolls up South-east.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu\n\nTalk about an Igbo man, who commands genuine respect from the president, the former Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, has no rival. He has maintained a good relationship with Buhari since the early years of the country\u2019s return to civil rule, when their paths crossed in the All Progressives Party (APP) \u2013 a camaraderie they enjoyed till the APC merger in 2015.\n\n\n\nAlthough Onu\u2019s placement in the cabinet is largely attributable to what he brought to the merger table, that he has kept his job has also been because Buhari has a personal relationship with him, which he considers more important than whatever new thing their political romance mighty have birthed.\n\n\n\nA respectable southeasterner and elder statesman, Onu\u2019s presence in the race for presidency is another pointer to the clamour for a president of the Igbo extraction. And with a resume that speaks to experience and capacity, although acceptability is debatable, Onu is equally strong in consideration, should the president decide to go to the east.\n\nAhmad Lawan\n\nWhat was first thought to be a child\u2019s play has turned around to pose one of the biggest threats to southern presidency in the APC. At least, so it is believed. Lawan\u2019s presidential bid was said to be an idea conceived out of the many extrapolations that envisaged what direction the opposition PDP might go. Same thinking has given rise to new ideas.\n\n\n\nBut cashing in on the confusion on the turf and the rigidity of the multiple southern aspirants, Lawan\u2019s choreographed idea has come to reality, standing conspicuously in the way of the southern agenda, which seeks power shift after Buhari\u2019s eight years in office by May 2023.\n\n\n\nLawan might not have particularly impressed a majority of Nigerians with his performance as President of the Senate. That\u2019s almost a consensus. His tenure pandered too much to virtually everything Buhari wanted, whether or not it sat well with the people. Particularly, his leadership made a mess of the amendment to the 2022 Electoral Act, which has continued to count against him. But all these have not reduced his place as a major contender to the nation\u2019s top job.\n\nAbubakar Badaru\n\nHere comes the dark horse in the true sense of it. The only thing many people can recall about the Jigawa State governor, Abubakar Badaru, is that he bought the presidential expression of interest and nomination forms and submitted them as others did. Not that he had been seen anywhere or caught on camera consulting with delegates or leaders in different parts of the country.\n\n\n\nAlthough a colleague of his from a neighbouring state was said to be preferred after some of the party\u2019s analyses were contextualised. However, because the fellow was said to have some issues with the United States government, then, the idea of encouraging Badaru became inevitable for reasons of realpolitik, when the threat posed by the opposition was all thrown on the table.\n\n\n\nThus, if the decision of the president is to go to the north, then, Badaru is said to come first before even before Lawan. That he has maintained a radio silence is not unintentional but part of the script meant to evolve and materialise at the nick of time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Total country\u2019s drilling deficit crosses 400,000bpd\n\n*With 26% share of Nigeria\u2019s gas export, Kyari says Spain remains major market\n\n* DHQ: Troops destroyed 40 illegal refineries in Niger Delta\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nFor the first time since April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the global oil industry, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) yesterday increased Nigeria\u2019s production quota to about 1.8 million (1.799) barrels per day.\n\n\n\nThe new oil drilling limit increased Nigeria\u2019s production deficit by an estimated 400, 000 barrels per day, since the country had only been able to produce about 1.4 million barrels daily of the 1.8 bpd ration.\n\n\n\nThe cartel and its allies, OPEC+ would increase oil production by 648,000 barrels per day in July, as opposed to the 400,000 bpd initially approved and the subsequent increase to 432,000bpd.\n\n\n\nThis was just as the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari , has said that with about 26 per cent of all Nigeria\u2019s gas exported to Spain, the country remains a major market for Nigeria.\n\n\n\nAlso, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) said yesterday that troops of the Nigeria Navy under Operation Octopus Grip and Operation Delta Safe discovered and destroyed 40 illegal refineries in the Niger Delta region in the last two weeks. Nigeria had blamed massive oil theft, years of declining upstream investment, inability to restart oil wells shut in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as outright sabotage by oil-producing communities for its lack of capacity to raise production.\n\n\n\nFrom the approved schedule, Saudi Arabia would drill 10.833 million barrels per day in July, same for Russia, while the UAE would produce 3.127 million barrels per day.\n\nIn the same vein, Angola would produce 1.502 barrels per day, Iraq would be 4.58 million bpd while Algeria was given a limit of 1.039 million bpd.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the increase by over 200,000 bpd was possibly to partly compensate for a small portion of Russian oil, which has been shut-in due to sanctions spurred by its war with Ukraine.\n\n\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 released by the organisation after the 29th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting held via videoconference, also acknowledged the most recent reopening from lockdowns in major global economic centres.\n\nIt further noted that global refinery intake was expected to increase after seasonal maintenance and highlighted the importance of stable and balanced markets for both crude oil and refined products.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe meeting therefore resolved to: Reaffirm the decision of the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meeting on 12 April 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings, including the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 18 July 2021.\n\n\n\n\u201cReconfirm the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.432 mb/d for the month of July 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdvance the planned overall production adjustment for the month of September and redistribute equally the 0.432 mb/d production increase over the months of July and August 2022. Therefore, July production will be adjusted upward by 0.648 mb/d,\u201d it stated.\n\n\n\nIt also resolved to extend the compensation period until the end of December 2022 as requested by some underperforming countries and called on underperforming countries to submit their plans by June 17, 2022.\n\nWhile reiterating the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism, OPEC noted that its next meeting will hold on June 30, 2022.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, speaking yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa Natural Resource and Energy Summit in Abuja, said while it was imperative to have a green initiative to fight carbon emission, it should reflect current realities and conditions.\n\n\n\nAs at today, Sylva argued that energy poverty was still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\n\n\n\u201cBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the average, only 48 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa population has access to electricity, while only 18 per cent has access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita,\u201d he argued.\n\n\n\nThe implication of this, he said, was that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive.\n\nConsequently, he noted that the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected, but stressed that climate change remains of serious concern to Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation,\u201d he maintained.\n\nAccording to him, energy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources.\n\nWith 26% Share of Nigeria\u2019s Gas Export, Kyari Says Spain Remains Major Market\n\nKyari yesterday said that with about 26 per cent of all Nigeria\u2019s gas exported to Spain, it remains a major market for the country. He, therefore, reiterated his commitment to sustaining what he described as the strategic energy partnership between both countries.\n\n\n\nKyari spoke while addressing Nigerian and Spanish business leaders on investment opportunities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry in Madrid, Spain, on the sidelines of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s state visit to the country.\n\nA statement by the Group General Manager, Public Affairs of the NNPC, Garba Muhammad, stated that Buhari had earlier met with the Spanish President, Pedro Sanchez, King of Spain, His Majesty, King Filipe VI, and had given a speech at the headquarters of the World Tourism Organization (WTO) in Madrid.\n\nDuring the visit, the NNPC statement quoted Buhari as saying that Nigeria looked forward to increasing bilateral relations with Spain.\n\n\n\nDescribing the partnership between Nigeria and Spain as an important one for the NNPC GMD said: \u201c26 per cent of all LNG produced in Nigeria ends up in Spain and 14 per cent of all crude oil produced in Nigeria ends up in this country. Clearly for us as a business, it is an important market for my company.\u201d\n\nKyari explained that the world would need energy for today and for the future in industries such as power, Information Technology, automobile, among others.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that energy transition is real. We know that net-zero by 2050-2060 is real. But it doesn\u2019t mean zero hydrocarbons in 2050-2060. It means that you are going to have a cleaner use of hydrocarbons,\u201d Kyari added.\n\nHe said that investors must get returns when they invest, with a high chance that they are able to recover their costs and make some margin from it.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, in line with global acceptance of gas as a transition fuel, Nigeria has since declared 2021-2030 as the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cIn our country today, we have a legislation that has clearly created a commercial National Oil Company (NOC) which will be unveiled by our president in the coming days.\n\n\u201cTogether with the Spanish business community, I am confident we can build this industry,\u201d Kyari explained\n\nDHQ: Troops Destroyed 40 Illegal Refineries in Niger Delta\n\nHowever, speaking at a media briefing in Abuja, yesterday, the Director, Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj.Gen.

          "text": "John Oyegun, chairman of the presidential screening committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Friday, presented the report of the panel to Abdullahi Adamu, chairman of the party.\n\nThe presidential screening exercise held on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIn his remarks, Oyegun said the committee was impressed by the pedigree of presidential hopefuls, adding that the APC should also be proud of its efforts to attract \u201cyouthful\u201d aspirants.\n\nHere are his remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is our pleasure to be here with you today to present our report. I will be very brief.\n\nHaving been a tenant in this building before, Mr National Chairman, let me say that I came in and I thought I was in the wrong premises. I want to say that you have performed something short of a miracle in this building. And I can tread properly now that I am in the secretariat of the governing party.\n\nI thank you for the assignment that you gave us and our members. I know how short time has been. I know the environment in which you took over. So, we were quite happy to also do as much as we could to make the work of the party lighter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe had the privilege of being inaugurated by you, precisely on the 30th of May, and we immediately started work on that very day after a brief meeting. I will just summarise.\n\nFirst, we had 23 aspirants that we interacted with. And my first comment is that indeed, we are a very lucky party. Those were 23 that presented themselves. We had a of lot of others \u2014 prominent Nigerians both within and outside the country \u2014 that had applied, but for whatever reason, could not proceed with their applications.\n\nThe point I want to make is on the quality of the people that want to govern this country. The second point I want to make is that, we were surprised at the active participation of youthful members of the party, some of whom really surprised us as to what they have accomplished in life, their understanding of the situation in this country, and why they want to have the privilege of governing this country. What was important was that they so believed in the country and the party that they were able to pay the sums that some of us considered princely handsome, to participate in the process. So, I think the party ought to pat itself in the back for that.\n\nOur report is basically simple and short. We don\u2019t want to beat about the bush. There were two aspects to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe basic constitutional qualifications for you to aspire to be a president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; that was simple and straightforward. And on that basis, every single aspirant that presented themselves qualified, because it was basic and simple.\n\nBut we are a governing party, and we are keen on continuing the process and replacing, at the proper time, our president with yet another member of the party. So, the ability to lead, background, experience, understanding of the Nigerian situation, ideas as to how issues, difficulties and problems can be addressed, and how the country can be moved forward, became a critical consideration.\n\nIt is on that basis \u2014 who are you, what have you achieved, what is your understanding of the nation and what you think you can contribute to move the nation forward \u2014 it was on the basis of that that we made our final shortlist. I don\u2019t want to list the names. I\u2019m going to leave that to you. But we have a shortlist which brought the number severely down to 13. We could have cut it a little shorter, but we wanted a pedigree of younger elements to surface, for them to be seen, for them to be noticed, and who knows? We hand them over to the party. And it is for the party to decide who their preferred candidate will be.\n\nAnd it is also an opportunity to showcase the kind of people that exist within the party with their youthfulness and kind of experience. Let the world know that this is a party that cares for the young and this is a party that when we say the young can aspire, we really mean it. And this has been showcased in the report that we have written.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will conclude by saying that we only threw a word of caution; that there is this cleavage that is gradually becoming the centre stage in national discourse between the north and the south and the presidency. And we just want to advise strongly that the party should please think of it in making its decision, address it, and let it influence their thoughts, because it has its own implications.\n\nOutside that, just on behalf of the wonderful colleagues you gave me to work with, I want to thank you very much. It was a sensitive assignment, a challenging assignment, but very interesting assignment from which I\u2019m sure all of us have profited immensely, and from which we think the party will also profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, one part I need to emphasise. We engaged every aspirant on the issue of consensus and it is a pleasant surprise that 98 to 99 percent agreed that the party is supreme. And that whatever the party finally decides, with proper consultation, they were likely to accept. We had only one exception who said \u2018yes, I will accept consensus so long as it is built on me\u2019. I think it is a point that needs to be emphasised. So, that gives you a lot of leeway in the days and hours ahead to trim down even more drastically. But finally, we think we should not be afraid of a contested primary if anybody insists on the contest.\n\nI thank you very much, Mr Chairman. It is now my honour and privilege, on behalf of the committee set up, to present to you the report.",
          "summary": "So, we were quite happy to also do as much as we could to make the work of the party lighter.\nWe had only one exception who said \u2018yes, I will accept consensus so long as it is built on me\u2019.\nSo, that gives you a lot of leeway in the days and hours ahead to trim down even more drastically.\nBut finally, we think we should not be afraid of a contested primary if anybody insists on the contest.\nIt is now my honour and privilege, on behalf of the committee set up, to present to you the report.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Patricia\u2019s CEO on taking risks and building for impact",
          "text": "Hanu Fejiro may today, at 26, sit atop a crypto exchange company boasting of 30,000 daily transactions and 660,000 users, but only a few years ago, he knew little about cryptocurrencies. The company in question, Patricia Technologies\u2014or just Patricia\u2014was originally registered in Nigeria as a gift card exchange after Fejiro fell into the hands of fraudsters.\n\nHe\u2019d received a gift card worth \u20a630,000 (~$73), in 2015, from his uncle in the US, in lieu of a monthly allowance. Needing to exchange the gift card for cash, he went online to transact with a gift card exchange, only to fall victim to a scam. Gift card scams are commonplace: users are asked to disclose the card\u2019s number, unwittingly granting the scammer access to its funds. After his experience, Fejiro figured that if he was getting scammed, others were too; building an exchange where people could safely exchange their gift cards for cash was an obvious opportunity. And he seized it.\n\nFor the next 2 years, from 2017 through 2018, Patricia would operate as a gift card exchange. But not for long.\n\nIn 2019, Fejiro transitioned Patricia from gift card exchanging to a line that he found to be blossoming in popularity and demand: crypto trading. Nigeria was on the cusp of being identified, within the next 2 years\u20142020 and 2021\u2014as a leading crypto economy. The stats thrown around about this development functioned as both news headlines and high praise for the country\u2019s crypto adoption rate. The highest number of Google searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d came from Nigeria. Twenty-three-point-seven percent of Nigerians online owned some form of cryptocurrency. Businesses were adding crypto plugins to their payment options. Trading volumes were surpassing $1 million per day on Binance.\n\nIf an economy could be a crypto heaven, Nigeria was looking like it. But the country\u2019s government did not share the enthusiasm. Soon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would descend its regulatory hammer on crypto trading, and Fejiro would have to think fast to save his young business.\n\nThinking fast, moving faster\n\nFejiro is speaking to me from Dubai. It has taken me and his team 5 weeks to schedule this interview; there\u2019d been a scheduling conflict in February and a long silence after that, until April, when he gets on a call with me, 6 minutes late, battling a cold that sometimes fogs up his voice. And yet, the story he tells me over the course of an hour, about himself and Patricia, is clear and does not stumble. It\u2019s a story he\u2019s told so many times he knows it backwards\u2014which comes as no surprise; he will write his memoir someday, he assures me, and is already shooting footage of his life for a future documentary.\n\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Port Harcourt, studying mathematics and statistics, he\u2019d done everything he could to make some extra change. He sold noodles, then popcorn, then started a clothing company, and had even attempted to start a taxi business. The list of start-and-stop businesses to his credit would eventually stretch from 5 to 13\u2014all before his hit venture: Patricia.\n\nI wonder at his going bullish on several entrepreneurial ventures while still in school. I ask as delicately as I can manage: was he poor? He says no. He\u2019d lost his dad when he was 8 and his mum when he was 16, just before university, but he hadn\u2019t lacked anything; his extended family took good care of him. He just had always been entrepreneurial, he says. When he was in primary school, growing up in Warri, south-south Nigeria, he distributed candy to 4 primary schools in his neighbourhood, earning enough profit to pay his family\u2019s rent for 2 years.\n\nFejiro has an uncomplicated relationship with executing his ideas; he does not overthink them. In his world, if it sounds like a plan, it probably is. He\u2019d christened his company by its curious name on a whim: his mother\u2019s name was Patience, but his grandfather preferred to call her Patricia, to annoy her, and start an argument\u2014every time. Many years later, when Patricia popped into Fejiro\u2019s head as a suggestion for his company\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t think about it twice.\n\n\u201cYou may spend so much time thinking and not acting fast enough,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the market is actually moving. You need to be able to move as fast as the market. When you spend too much time thinking, you end up losing everything.\u201d\n\nAnd so, when the CBN suddenly banned commercial banks from facilitating crypto transactions, Fejiro knew he had to think\u2014and act\u2014 quickly.\n\nNews of the ban had dropped on February 5, 2021, a Friday afternoon. Reactions to it on social media were riotous, angry, and pained. The apex bank had not only proscribed banks from servicing crypto transactions, it had ordered them to close all accounts found to be used for crypto trading. Worse, the following week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) banned crypto use altogether.\n\nWhen it became clear that the country\u2019s regulations had a hostile attitude towards crypto use, Fejiro relocated Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, famous\u2014at the time\u2014for its liberal crypto regime. This was 5 months after the ban in Nigeria.\n\nThe Estonian business environment is famously progressive. The country has an e-residency programme\u2014the first country in the world to introduce this; a young entrepreneur can easily incorporate their startup there, in a process that takes less than an hour and costs less than \u20ac5,000\u2014all based on a residency permit that is entirely digital. The country had even considered introducing its own national cryptocurrency, the estcoin, in 2017.\n\nBut the Estonian crypto party would not last long. Three months after Patricia\u2019s relocation, the Estonian government opened discussions to tighten its crypto regulations; in March this year, the tightening became law, a move directed at combating rising fraud and money laundering issues associated with its earlier liberal crypto regulations.\n\nAlthough Fejiro supports the tightened regulations, it would seem that he is cautious about camping his business too close to regulatory quick fire. He moved Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Lithuania.\n\n\u201cWe moved out of Estonia when the law became too stringent for us to operate,\u201d he says.\n\nWay bigger than him now\n\nFejiro rises at 7:30 AM, every day. Three times a week his day begins with him receiving management updates from a team he had gradually built from 2 to over 350 employees spread across Ghana, Lithuania, the UK, Nigeria, and China. The management meetings set the tone of his day. Although he describes himself as a risk taker, building a thriving business may have given that trait an altruistic edge. When he started Patricia, he\u2019d invested all his personal money in the venture, but he tells me now that that kind of risk taking is well behind him. \u201cWhen you start a company, you really have nothing to lose except your life savings\u2014and that\u2019s just my life savings. I will take risks, though,\u201d he cautions, lest I get it twisted, \u201cbut at the scale we\u2019re at now, I wouldn\u2019t take a bet-the-company risk, because Patricia is way bigger than me now.\u201d\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "text": "As Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine passes the 100-day mark on Friday (today), its ripple effects are reverberating across sectors of Africa\u2019s biggest economy, inflicting more pain on Nigerians.\n\nRussia\u2019s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, has pushed the prices of crude oil, natural gas, aluminium, nickel, wheat, and other commodities to record highs.\n\nThis development has taken a toll on many economies, including Nigeria\u2019s, and worsening the economic woes facing Nigerians.\n\nThe distance between Nigeria and Ukraine is an estimated 8,287 kilometres but the conflict has led to higher petrol subsidy bill and a surge in the prices of diesel, aviation fuel, cooking gas and some food items.\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of natural gas, largest exporter of wheat and one of the world\u2019s largest oil-producing nations.\n\nAnalysts say this development has pushed up the cost of living for millions of Nigerians and further exposed the country\u2019s inability to make the most of its oil fortunes.\n\nThe country\u2019s dependence on goods from refined petroleum products to fertilisers, and food, especially wheat, has seen Nigerians paying for a war they are not a part of.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, Nigeria\u2019s imports from Ukraine included \u2018milk preparations\u2019, wheat, and maize seed, while wheat, mackerel, herrings, blue whitings, other fish products and vaccines were imported from Russia.\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria imported N215.7 billion worth of food-related goods from Russia, but others such as fertiliser components were not listed in the trade data by the National Bureau Statistics (NBS) that was analysed. More than half of Nigeria\u2019s imports from Russia were for wheat, and for almost three months now, that market has ceased.\n\nEven though food prices were already on the rise in Nigeria before the war, food inflation rose to 18.37 percent in April, attributed to increases in the prices of bread and cereals, food products, potatoes, yam, wine, fish, meat, energy, and oils.\n\n\u201cAs at this time last year, NPK fertiliser sold for N7,500 but currently sells around N30,000 and farmers are expected to buy it in producing food for the populace,\u201d said Olufemi Abioye, who heads the Igangan Agropark Investors Association, with 39,000 hectares of farmland in Oyo state.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of this in food production is clear. Expensive fertilisers mean farmers avoid it, farm outputs reduce, and food shortages increase.\u201d\n\nRead also: UN chief presses Putin for Mariupol evacuation, calls for ceasefire\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of fertilisers, accounting for 23 percent of ammonia exports, 14 percent of urea exports, 10 percent of processed phosphate exports, and 21 percent of potash exports, according to data from The Fertilizer Institute.\n\nAs BusinessDay previously reported, while Nigeria is rich in urea, it imports 34 percent of the raw materials needed to produce NPK.\n\nBusinessDay reported in April that the country had four trapped inbound vessels containing over 70,000 metric tonnes of potash \u2013 a key raw material input in producing NPK \u2014 owing to the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\nIt was gathered that the cost of ploughing an acre has risen from N8,000 per acre last year to N15,000 this year.\n\nAccording to Abioye, some labourers even get paid with motorcycles after 10 months. The motorcycle may have been made in India, China or assembled locally, but its primary importation is done with dollars, and the naira\u2019s weakening has been exacerbated since the Ukraine conflict started. Now, more naira is required to buy the same goods, implying losses for the local purchasers or those using it to pay for labour like Abioye.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, while crop failures are to be expected in Ukraine in 2022, Russia has imposed an export ban on products such as wheat until the end of June 2022, leading observers to predict shortages and rising prices among their trade partners and on the world market.\n\nRead also: U.S. \u2018adding fuel to fire\u2019 by supplying Ukraine with rockets \u2013 Russia\n\nUkraine and Russia are also among the world\u2019s top exporters for other important food staples. Around two thirds of the global exports of crucial sunflower products like oil and feed come from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nBoth countries account for 27 percent of global wheat output, and 63 percent of sunflower oil and seeds, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and countries like Nigeria that depend on imported wheat will feel the impact a lot. Even when they switch to other countries, rising prices mean they would be paying more.\n\nIn Nigeria, wheat is used in the production of major staples such as semolina, bread and pastries from wheat flour, noodles, and pasta, among others, which form a regular part of meals in most households across the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no downplaying the blow that the war has dealt to food systems, already fragile from two years of COVID-19 disruptions, climate extremes, currency devaluations, and worsening fiscal constraints,\u201d said Mari Elka Pangestu, World Bank managing director of development policy and partnerships.",

          "text": "Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), has restated his position on the future of Nigeria, noting that restructuring remained the only pathway to a sustainable future and not another election.\n\nUko, who is the secretary of the Eastern Conservative Assembly (ECA), lamented that Nigeria is bleeding but instead of finding real solutions, politicians have preoccupied themselves with another election in 2023, warning that the solution doesn\u2019t lie in another election.\n\nThe Enugu based activist noted that since the NADECO days when the late Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu sold the idea of restructuring to Emeka Ojukwu, and since the late former vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, proposed a six regional structure to Sani Abacha, there have been no superior suggestion on the way forward for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSince 1996, during the NADECO era, when Admiral Godwin Ndubuisi Kanu on one hand, sold the restructuring agenda to us, and the duo of Dim Chukwuemeka Odimegwu-Ojukwu and Dr Alex Ekwueme on the other hand, presented the six regional structure and devolution of powers to the General Abacha constitutional conference, I am yet to see a superior argument for the salvation and rebuilding of Nigeria, save returning to true federalism and devolution of powers and resource control,\u201d Uko said in a statement titled \u2018unappealing but imperative truth,\u2019 issued on Thursday.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAny other route sounds more expensive, unhealthy and unhelpful. This electioneering season our brethren will find any talk on restructuring Nigeria, offensive and unappealing.\n\n\u201cYet it remains the only pathway to a new greater, better, united Nigeria. From now till early next year, our country men and women will remain committed to ascendance to power via the 2023 General elections.\n\n\u201cThey will care less about the political, social and economic health of the country. They want power and the fame, authority, wealth and the good life that comes with political office.\u201d\n\nThe activist warned that those who insist that the 1999 constitution is cast in iron, don\u2019t mean well for the country, even as he noted that piecemeal amendments to the constitution is a waste of time.\n\n\u201cThey think advocates of restructuring are trouble makers. Some of our brethren insist the 1999 constitution is cast in iron. They say only piecemeal amendment of same will transform the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey see reconstructing the polity as an unpredictable excersise that could lead to unexpected consequences. They prefer to continue managing the 1999 constitution and only allow certain \u201csafe\u201d amendments that won\u2019t rock the boat.\u201d\n\nUko regretted that, \u201cthe land is bleeding. The unitary structure bequeathed us by the military isn\u2019t working. The situation continues to deteriorate,\u201d noting that \u201cElections alone won\u2019t solve this. Massive unemployment, inflation, insecurity and agitations eat up the land.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFrom 66 million people in the 1970s to over 200 million folks today, from the command and control military era to a very rickety democracy with very weak institutions, ethnic and religious differences that encourages dichotomy and exclusion, the ever-growing population makes it difficult to run the country solely on crude oil royalties. Without diversifying the economy, the country crashes.\n\n\u201cFossil fuel will soon be out of fashion with very little demand for it. The 36 states can longer survive on monthly allocation from oil proceeds. The hegemonic control of an all powerful central Government carrying the 36 states, is no longer viable.\n\n\u201cThe frenzy and euphoria of the electioneering season has blinded us to the undeniable fact that only an early restructuring of the polity along the lines of true federalism and devolution of powers, can heal Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that some popular or powerful politician can make Nigeria great under this unitary 1999 constitution. It is also untrue that any political party can transform Nigeria under this suffocating 1999 constitution.\n\n\u201cThe truth rather, is that the restructuring of the country remains the most important, urgent and needed thing today in Nigeria. Our problems as a country, stem from structural defects.\n\n\u201cIf the 2023 election will be manipulated, that would be because the 1999 constitution and the current prevailing unitary structure makes it possible for the manipulators to succeed.\n\n\u201cI hereby put expected and prospective wailers on notice, that when they begin to wail, to cry, to complain and lament how the electoral process was abused and perverted to aid a certain candidate or party, be it known unto them that such evil happen only because of the unkind unitary structure that is killing the country.\n\n\u201cThose who are blinded by the quest for political power and high office should do well to realise that unless we courageously face reality and revert to true federalism and devolution of powers, our dear country will continue to drift.\n\n\u201cElections come and go. Actors also come and go. The real issues plaguing Nigeria continues to hold her down, regrettably.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that the litany of troubles afflicting the land stem from the foundational errors.\n\n\u201cThe feeding bottle system that encourages sleaze and indolence. The central control that inspires mediocrity, marginalisation and discontent.\n\n\u201cThe disaffection that grow agitation and the loss of faith that encourages bitterness and anger. Elections alone cannot heal the land. Addressing the structural disease will rejuvenate the land, restore unity and patriotism, rekindling hope and love for fatherland.\n\n\u201cThis inalienable truth maybe unappealing especially at this time of politicking and election, but it remains imperative truth and the only pathway to peace, harmony and progress.\n\n\u201cWithout restructuring Nigeria, we will continue to swim backwards. Since 1995/1996, the campaign to restructure Nigeria has remained germane till date.\n\n\u201cA restructured Nigeria will be home for all, progressive and promising. There\u2019s no better pathway.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I wish our politicos and their \u201ccustomers\u201d happy elections.\u201d",
          "summary": "This electioneering season our brethren will find any talk on restructuring Nigeria, offensive and unappealing.\nSome of our brethren insist the 1999 constitution is cast in iron.\nThey prefer to continue managing the 1999 constitution and only allow certain \u201csafe\u201d amendments that won\u2019t rock the boat.\u201dUko regretted that, \u201cthe land is bleeding.\n\u201cIt is not true that some popular or powerful politician can make Nigeria great under this unitary 1999 constitution.\n\u201cWithout restructuring Nigeria, we will continue to swim backwards.",

That is surely out of his character, as Engineer David Babachir Lawal, attested in his viral whatsApp statement.\n\n\u201cTinubu\u2019s speech in Abeokuta did not demonstrate any disrespect to President Buhari, for whom he has a very high regard, and whose re-election campaign he chaired in 2019.\n\n\u201cSince the video of the speech he delivered in Yoruba hit the social media, varied interpretations have been given to the speech, which in the main was about Governor Abiodun, who in the true tradition of Yoruba culture bowed to his leader after Tinubu\u2019s short speech.\n\n\u201cThe Tinubu campaign is not surprised why the opposition in the APC have decided to turn and twist the statement.\n\n\u201cThe former Lagos governor, a great party man remains the man to beat at the party\u2019s convention on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are least surprised that he is the target of well-calculated and most unkind virulent attacks\n\n\u201cThe campaign organisation hereby appeals to the media to avoid over- sensationalising issues of facts and play its constitutional role of informing the electorate to make informed choices at the presidential primaries.\u201d",

          "title": "My respect for Buhari high, unfailing, I can't denigrate him: Tinubu speaks",
          "text": "One of the leading APC Presidential aspirants, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has said his respect for President Muhammadu Buhari is very high and unfailing, saying he cannot denigrate him.\n\nTinubu, in a statement he personally signed on Friday was reacting to sensational reports and misrepresentation of facts of what he said in Abeokuta on Thursday about Buhari.\n\nHe said sensationalism and willful inaccuracy tended to push aside truth during such moments of primaries, saying he made this statement so that truth and accuracy might have a chance.\n\n\u201cIt is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand. Whatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\n\u201cThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sections of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba.\n\n\u201cThose who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement. Instead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\n\u201cAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary. President Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people.\n\n\u201cLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in-Chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it.\n\n\u201cI believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu said he, indeed, consistently supported the president and his administration, and that even when the administration had come under intense criticism, his feet had always been planted solidly in defence of the president.\n\nHe stated that the president personally nominated him to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019, saying this he did not because he opposed him or because he was indifferent.\n\n\u201cHe did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since. When I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of his presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would asperse the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\n\u201cIn Abeokuta, I spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair. There are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories.\n\n\u201cNow that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in. However, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes.\n\n\u201cBut President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation,\u201d he added.\n\nTinubu said Buhari is a Nigerian patriot and a man of integrity and that these qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019.\n\nHe said he was proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018I make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own right. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\n\n\u201cMy aspiration to be President of Nigeria is based on my want to serve the nation and not that I feel some personal entitlement to high office. Governance of this nation is a sacred and solemn duty. It is neither to be given as a favour to someone who is unqualified nor should people be motivated by personal reasons to prevent the most qualified person from attaining the office.\n\n\u201cThe wellbeing of over 200 million souls is at stake. Let us all realise this and act accordingly, I only desire a level-playing ground for all aspirants and an adherence to stipulated rules and due process. If in the fairness of such a process, I do not emerge as the party\u2019s candidate, I shall have no complaints regarding an honest primary and will accept the fair outcome as a true democrat,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "The attention of the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation has been drawn to the erroneous, misleading and mischievous interpretation of his address in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State on Thursday.\n\nIt is on record that the leading presidential aspirant in the forthcoming primaries of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu addressed the national delegates of the party in Ogun State , with Governor Mr.Dapo Abiodun in attendance.\n\nIn his effort to convince the party delegates to vote for him at the primaries, he went down memory lane to provide specific instances when he brought his political clout and strategic skills to assist individuals, groups and tendencies in the party to gain political power.\n\nThese factual references are already in the public realm.\n\nThey have been reported and analysed in the media in the last eight years.\n\nThey are therefore, matters of public knowledge.\n\nWhile we recognise that recent unexpected interventions in the time table and the heat generated by the proximity of the event might have led to some anxiety, this campaign organisation believes that the main thrust of Asiwaju\u2019s presentation, was that his huge contributions to the formation and electoral success of the All Progressives Congress should count in his favour as a true party man who desires to be the flag bearer.\n\nThere is also no doubt that the fresh conditions proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari for the consideration of a presidential candidate of the party made it necessary for Asiwaju to labour to convince the delegates that he fits the bill.\n\nThe campaign was surprised at the way the opposition and Tinubu\u2019s traducers had turned his statement to give an interpretation Tinubu did not mean and did not say.\n\nAt no time did Tinubu play any ethnic card or denigrate any ethnic group. That is surely out of his character, as Engineer David Babachir Lawal, attested in his viral whatsApp statement.\n\nTinubu\u2019s speech in Abeokuta did not demonstrate any disrespect to President Buhari, for whom he has a very high regard, and whose re-election campaign he chaired in 2019.\n\nSince the video of the speech he delivered in Yoruba hit the social media, varied interpretations have been given to the speech, which in the main was about Governor Abiodun, who in the true tradition of Yoruba culture bowed to his leader after Tinubu\u2019s short speech.\n\nThe Tinubu campaign is not surprised why the opposition in the APC have decided to turn and twist the statement.\n\nThe former Lagos governor, a great party man remains the man to beat at the party\u2019s convention on Monday.\n\nWe are least surprised that he is the target of well-calculated and most unkind virulent attacks\n\nThe campaign organisation hereby appeals to the media to avoid over- sensationalising issues of facts and play its constitutional role of informing the electorate to make informed choices at the presidential primaries.",

          "text": "\u2026Northern Muslim clerics root for VP, party disqualifies 10 aspirants \u2026We didn\u2019t screen Jonathan \u2013 Oyegun\n\nBarely two days after President Muhammadu Buhari spoke on the need for governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to support his decision to pick his successor, the governors have begun moves to back Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a leading presidential aspirant of the party.\n\nBuhari\u2019s plea\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with the 22 APC governors and the party\u2019s national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, President Buhari had pleaded with the governors to allow him the honour of picking \u201cmy successor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the party and as we approach the convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cI wish to assure you that the consultation process shall continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention. This would also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors is effectively brought under control and that our party emerges stronger,\u201d he had said.\n\nFresh moves\n\nHowever, in a fresh move to rally support for Osinbajo, Blueprint Weekend gathered that some governors had Thursday night at the Villa met with the VP and the Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, as a move to achieve \u201ca consensus presidential candidate to minimise friction and ensure a united front by the ruling party.\u201d\n\nThe governors in attendance, according to a source who does not want his name in print, were two presidential aspirants namely; Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state and his Ebonyi state counterpart, Engr. David Umahi. Others were Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state, Abdullahi Sule of Nasara state, and Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe state.\n\nAlso, in attendance were some top party chieftains from different geo-political zones who begged not to be named.\n\nThe PGF meeting\n\nOur source also said there were several meetings held on May 31, after the president\u2019s statement on naming his successor.\n\n\u201cThe 22 governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), appear to have agreed on a consensus candidate in Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, ahead of the party\u2019s long- awaited presidential primaries to be held on June 6.\n\n\u201cThe governors who held a series of meetings at the Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja, on May 31, after their meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, were initially deadlocked on a consensus arrangement.\n\n\u201cHowever, after reconvening, they agreed that the Presidency of the party should be zoned to the South and that the candidate should be Prof. Osinbajo.\u201d\n\nGiving further insight into why the governors could not initially agree on a consensus arrangement, he said, \u201cThe governors failed to reach an agreement on a consensus candidate in their first meeting because different governors were working for different aspirants and they were all pushing for their aspirants to be accepted based on a North-South divide.\n\n\u201cThe heroes of this whole thing are the governors of Borno, Nasarawa and Gombe who, even though they are from the North, argued that the VP from the South fits the bill perfectly. The Kaduna state governor was also of the same view, but he has not been seen in the Villa this week. He was represented by his deputy at the meeting with the President on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cBut I must also add that some governors had first insisted that the party\u2019s Presidency should be zoned to the North because the main opposition party had settled for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar at their convention.\n\n\u201cIt was a very heated argument among the governors. Some of them wanted a Northern candidate to challenge the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, but some other northern governors kicked against it. They said it is morally right for power to return to the South.\n\n\u201cThe governors represented different interests and tendencies at the Kebbi Governor\u2019s Lodge meeting and were all pushing for their candidates. However, there were more governors who were loyal to President Buhari and wanted to reciprocate the president\u2019s gesture.\n\n\u201cThere were others who also insisted that Mr. VP was the most popular candidate based on the feedback that the governors got from delegates in their states and they were almost certain and very confident that he would defeat candidates from other parties, including Atiku.\u201d\n\nSome govs adamant\n\nNotwithstanding the overwhelming support from the governors, a few of them still chose to stand with their choice aspirants.\n\nAn aide to one of the governors privy to the happenings at the Kebbi Governor\u2019s Lodge meeting, who spoke under anonymity because he was not so authorised, told this medium that some governors also chose to stand with their choice aspirants.\n\n\u201cIt was indeed a difficult call, as some governors were asked to reach out to their candidates to relate the choice of the governors and to also tell them to step down their ambition so that the party can present a united front at the convention.\n\n\u201cSome governors were not open to discussing the consensus matter with their aspirants because they feared that their candidates would reject the proposal. Rather, they will go to the polls and lose rather than support the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nThere are media reports that no fewer than six governors had communicated the decision of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum to the VP, with another three personally visiting Osinbajo as a mark of loyalty.\n\n\u201cThe governors are very confident that the vice-president will deliver the required votes to win the 2023 elections, but more importantly it is for the party to remain one because we have Osun and Ekiti governorship elections around the corner and we will work together to win those elections as we prepare for the 2023 elections,\u201d said another party source.\n\nNorthern Muslim clerics\u2019 choice\n\nMeanwhile, the vice-president\u2019s support base further got swollen with some prominent northern Muslim clerics from Sokoto and Kano states describing him as \u201cthe best person to succeed Buhari.\u201d\n\nThe influential clerics said Nigeria \u201ccannot afford to play money politics during the 2023 general elections\u201d and urged the APC delegates to choose an aspirant with \u201cconscience and a good track record, without corruption allegations.\u201d\n\nIn Sokoto, the Chief Imam of Gagi community Jumua\u2019t Mosque, Sheikh Abdulmalik Bello, said it is only the VP that can take Nigeria out of the challenges it faces presently.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria needed \u201ca unifier, a man who can give a sense of belonging to every Nigerian irrespective of tribe or religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo can take us out of the present bad condition we are in at the moment. Nigeria is a country with many tribes and religions, we need someone who can unify the country and every part would have a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is time to elect based on competence, courage and character and the vice president is the man that can take Nigeria out of the present challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe vice-president is the best for now because he is of good age to deliver a good leadership to Nigerians and has shown courage when given the opportunity to act as president.\n\n\u201cIf given the opportunity to lead, he can make good decisions that will help the country; looking at his educational background and experience in governance.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking in Sokoto, Prof. Sani Sagir of the Physics Department, Usmanu Danfodio University, Imam and deputy national president 1, Jama\u2019atu Izalatul Bid\u2019a Waiqamatusunnah, said politics \u201cis very important in Islam as it gives the opportunity to choose one\u2019s leaders.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, called on APC delegates to elect \u201ca leader with the fear of God and is courageous to take the right decisions; someone who can be just to all not minding his geographic location or religion but he must be a man of justice and fair play.\u201d\n\nSagir said: \u201cWe have never heard president Buhari complain about the vice- president or have any allegation of corruption against him. My advice to the political parties is to choose good candidates that are educated and humble, who can listen to the plight of the ordinary people.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who is very patient in listening, and courageous to do the right thing, and also a person who is trustworthy and among these features, I mentioned the vice-president because he has all the qualities, he is very educated and courageous and trustworthy because for the several times the president gave him opportunity as acting president he has delivered and we have not heard the president for once complain about him. So, I see him as the best among all the candidates in the ruling APC.\u201d\n\nAnother cleric in Sokoto Sheikh Muhammad Talata-Mafara, also cautioned Nigerians against money bags and urged them to vote in the right person.\n\n\u201cA good leader is a person with people\u2019s interests at heart, is pious and submits himself to improving their living standard,\u201d he said.\n\nTalata-Mafara, a renowned Islamic scholar, who translated many Islamic books, especially those written by Sheikh Usman Bin Fodio, also called on Nigerians to consider capability and achievements in supporting any presidential aspirant and other people seeking elective positions.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein in Kano, Sheikh Bilal Jabir-Elkanawy, called on Nigerians to ensure transparency and fairness during the electioneering, while delegates should vote for the most credible candidates at the primary.\n\nThe prominent cleric Jabir-Elkanawiy cautioned against selling votes to the highest bidders or political moneybags.\n\n\u201cSelling votes against their conscience to the highest bidders or moneybags is dangerous and it is against Islam. Nigerians need to choose a credible candidate from the primary for the masses to make their choice during the general elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cI want to urge all delegates and Nigerians to vote wisely, because of their children, their relatives and for the interest of our great nation, Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nScreening of aspirants\n\nMeanwhile, the party\u2019s screening committee headed by Chief John Odigie-Oyegun has disqualified two former governors from the South and eight others.\n\nOur correspondent reliably gathered that Governor Kayode Fayemi; former Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi and former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, and 10 other presidential aspirants were successful at the screening.\n\nHowever, contrary to speculations in some quarters, Odigie-Oyegun said his panel did not screen the much-talked about former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen Friday at the APC national secretariat, after he submitted the committee\u2019s report to APC\u2019s national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Odigie-Oyegun who did not mention the identities of aspirants disqualified or cleared to participate at the presidential primaries, said the committee\u2019s findings were arrived at after considering the antecedents of the aspirants.\n\nA party source, however, told our correspondent that two governors from the South were disqualified.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI won\u2019t mention their names to you, but be informed that a popular former governor and one other who have been a senator were disqualified based on security reports and their cases with anti-graft agencies.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether former President Goodluck Jonathan was screened by his panel or not, Chief Oyegun said, \u201cNo, no, no; I am not aware. The answer is no.\u201d\n\nAdamu while receiving the report thanked the committee for its work.\n\nApparently making a veiled reference to the recent outburst of one of the aspirants, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on his suitability to succeed President Buhari, he declared that that the ticket of the party is not the exclusive preserve of anybody.\n\nHe also hinted that the eventual presidential aspirant of the party might be picked in tandem with the Not Too Young to Run Bill passed into law by former President Goodlick Jonathan in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is the day we have been waiting for the report of this eminent committee that have sat, interacted and considered, appraised the submission of all the members of the aspiring community.\n\n\u201cI listened with very keen interest to the comment that the chairman made in the course of his submission. One thing which I found worthy of very special mention is the fact that the Nigerian youth have responded.\n\n\u201cI still recall the Not too young to run bill we passed into law in the 8th Assembly. I feel encouraged that young people and young women have offered themselves to contest for this office.\n\n\u201cAs it is in every competition, we received the report now. We will consider it at the very highest level of the party and see how we approach the forthcoming convention that has the ultimate authority on the choice of who takes the flag of our party.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council(NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company, that not only sell seed but teach farmers advance planting technique for optimum yield.\n\nGAWAL was established in Nigeria in 2006 and has\n\nbeen committed to the agricultural development of Nigeria through the production and supply of quality crop seeds.\n\nAs one of the large-scale seed companies in Nigeria, it has supplied over 20,000 mt rice and maize seeds to Nigeria farmers in over 30 states.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

Customs HC Project Limited was expected to last for 36 months, to enhance the agency\u2019s mode of operation using the application of information and technology in all aspects of its administration.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of this project is to completely automate every aspect of the customs business and to institutionalize the use of smart and emerging technologies that will enhanced the statutory function of the Nigerian Customs Service in the areas of revenue generation as well as trade facilitation and enhancement of security,\u201d the Minister of Finance and Budget Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had told State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting in 2020.\n\nAhmed had explained that was to be financed by sponsors \u201cwho will in return look over the investment in the concessionary period of 20 years\u201d while it has the potential to generate up to $176 billion for the country.\n\n\u201cSo this investment of $3.1 billion is broken down into capital investment of $1.2 million which will be done in three phases over 36 months by these investors and $1.1 million is our projection of the operational cost over the 20-year period of the implementation of this project.\n\n\u201cThis project has the potential to yield up to $176 billion of revenue for the project and the consortia that are providing this investment are going to be paid over time according to the schedule that is negotiated for their investments including their profits and cost,\u201d she had said.\n\nAsked to explain the rationale behind a new e-Customs concession agreement between the NCS, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Limited, Ahmed said: \u201cThe E-customs project was approved by Council. And there were some challenges that had to do with disagreements between the concession partners. Remember that the government was not a partner of the concession; it was a group of different investing parties that came together and formed the consortium.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice have intervened. There were several meetings to try to iron out the difference. So it has to do with shareholders, who has what responsibility. And at the end of the day, I think one of the partners in the concession did not agree with the arrangements\u201d, she stated.",

          "title": "I Did Not Disrespect Buhari In Abeokuta, I Have High Regard For Him \u2013 Tinubu",
          "text": "A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said he holds President Muhammadu Buhari in high regard.\n\nReactions had trailed Mr Tinubu\u2019s comments in Abeokuta on Thursday where he said he deserves to lead the nation after helping President Buhari win the 2015 election.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Tinubu said his comments were not meant to disrespect the President and had been taken out of context.\n\nHe said reactions suggesting he had been disrespectful were sensational and incorrect.\n\nSee Mr Tinubu\u2019s full statement below:\n\nI HAVE HIGH REGARD AND RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT BUHARI\n\nWe have entered the meat of primary season. Sensationalism and wilful inaccuracy tend to push aside truth during such moments. I make this statement so that truth and accuracy may have a chance. It is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand. Whatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\nThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sections of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba. Those who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement. Instead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\nAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary. President Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people.\n\nLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in-Chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\nIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since. When I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of his presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would asperse the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\nIn Abeokuta, I spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair. There are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories. Now that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in. However, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\n\nPresident Buhari is a Nigerian patriot, a man of integrity. These qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019. I am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\nI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own right. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\n\nMy aspiration to be President of Nigeria is based on my want to serve the nation and not that I feel some personal entitlement to high office. Governance of this nation is a sacred and solemn duty. It is neither to be given as a favour to someone who is unqualified nor should people be motivated by personal reasons to prevent the most qualified person from attaining the office. The wellbeing of over 200 million souls is at stake. Let us all realise this and act accordingly, I only desire a level-playing ground for all aspirants and an adherence to stipulated rules and due process. If in the fairness of such a process, I do not emerge as the party\u2019s candidate, I shall have no complaints regarding an honest primary and will accept the fair outcome as a true democrat.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Tinubu\n\nJune 3, 2022.",

          "title": "I have high regard and respect for President Buhari, says Tinubu -",
          "text": "Leading Presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has described POresident Muhammadu Buhari as someone he has high regard and respect for.\n\nThe former Lagos governor stated in a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen on Friday.\n\nRead the full statement below:\n\nWe have entered the meat of primary season. Sensationalism and willful inaccuracy tend to push aside truth during such moments. I make this statement so that truth and accuracy may have a chance. It is important that people truly know what I said and where I stand.\n\nWhatever view you have of me is within your right to make. But let it be based on truth and not on falsehood or reckless exaggeration.\n\nThere have been gross misinterpretations in some sectors of the media regarding comments I made on Thursday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. To a degree, the erroneous interpretations may be somewhat innocent given that I spoke in Yoruba. Those who do not understand the nuances of this richly layered and subtly language may have inadvertently yet erroneously missed the true meaning of what I said while attempting to translate my statement. Instead of weighing what I said carefully, they translated so quickly and thus inaccurately in an attempt to meet media deadlines. Of course, there are also those who knew better but they conveyed these inaccuracies because the sensationalism suits their political purposes.\n\nAgain, such propaganda and misinformation becomes daily fare in the heat of the political season. Let\u2019s just state what needs to be stated. My opponents want to present a narrative that I made comments disrespectful of President Muhammadu Buhari in hopes that such a narrative would convince President Buhari to oppose my aspirations regarding the approaching primary. President Buhari is an experienced and accomplished leader. I do not believe he will be taken by the tricks of such people.\n\nLet me also erase any doubt. My respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in- chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\nIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since. When I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of this presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would asperse the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\nIn Abeokuta, I spoke to the unwarranted attacks against my person that have been part of the campaign of others. I also recounted the history of the party for those whose memories need repair. There are many who had no role in the birth of the APC and in its many victories. Now that the party has climbed the political summit, they want to claim credit for something they had no part in. However, this cannot be said of President Buhari. I am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\n\nPresident Buhari is a Nigerian patriot, a man of integrity. These qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019. I am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\nI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own right. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\n\nMy aspiration to be President of Nigeria is based on my want to serve the nation and not that I feel some personal entitlement to high office. Governance of this nation is a sacred and solemn duty. It is neither to be given as a favour to someone who is unqualified nor should people be motivated by personal reasons to prevent the most qualified person from attaining the office. The wellbeing of over 200 million souls is at stake. Let us all realise this and act accordingly, I only desire a level playing ground for all aspirants and an adherence to stipulated rules and due process. If in the fairness of such a process, I do not emerge as the party\u2019s candidate, I shall have no complaints regarding an honest primary and will accept the fair outcome as a true democrat.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Tinubu\n\nJune 3, 2022.",

          "text": "The person Nigeria needs is a leader who understands how to deal with current global economic dynamics and someone who will be acceptable in all parts of the country.\n\nThose were the words of the Director General of the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Kashim Shettima, while speaking on TVC\u2019s current affairs programme, Journalist Hangout.\n\nHe insists that the All Progressives Congress will be doing itself a lot of good by picking an aspirant who has the capacity to march the candidate of the leading Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nThe former governor of Borno state described the reception and acceptability of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as overwhelming. He described their visits to Ibadan and Abeokuta on Thursday thunderous. \u201cThe reception accorded to our candidate has been very wonderful. We were in Ibadan yesterday. The thunderous ovation in Oyo and Ogun state and actually with the emergence of Atiku Abubakar, the dynamics has completely changed. Asiwaju is the only candidate with the pedigree, with the brand name that stand shoulder to shoulder with Atiku or even more, because if his stature. By God\u2019s grace our candidate will emerge the flagbearer of APC in the next 72hours. It\u2019s not a subject of dispute but a question of time.\n\nIn what he described as deliberate misrepresentation and distortion, Senator Shettima said: \u201cAnd Yesterday, in Abeokuta, he made some remarks that were deliberately distorted and quoted out of context. And this is something we have been saying repeatedly. Those that have nothing to show want us to go low. Whether the opponent of Tinubu want to know and accept his roles not only in the emergence of Buhari as APC candidate but in his victory in 2015, Asiwaju was instrumental to Buhari\u2019s victory in 2015.\u201d\n\nSenator Shettima stated further: \u201cIn 2011 presidential election as a CPC candidate, Buhari scored 2689 votes in Ekiti, 17,600 in Ogun, 6,997 in Osun. But in 2015, President Buhari got 30,8290 in Ogun, 383,603 in Osun, 120,133 in Ekiti. Of course, the president has been performing very well in the north, but despite this he couldn\u2019t win in 2003, 2007 and 2011. Tinubu deserves to be treated with dignity and decorum because he has paid his dues. Without the bloc votes the South gave us in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari wouldn\u2019t have emerged as president.\u201d\n\nMr. Shettima who comes from the North Eastern part of Nigeria believes that giving every part of the country a sense of belonging is more important than regional demands.\n\n\u201cMy own take on this is simple. APC itself is an amalgam of contested interests. It was a child of necessity. It was born out of ANPP, ACN, CPC, APGA and of course the new PDP. Power has resided in the north for the past 8years, justice, equity demand power should move to the South. Some people say anything goes in politics, but believe me, not everything that goes in politics. There\u2019s no clear guaranty that picking candidate from the north APC we\u2019ll win in 2023. Apart from my governor, Professor Zulum, there\u2019s nobody in the north that can win 2million votes on its own.\n\nThe north and the south are the Nigeria\u2019s political configuration. The northeast is a constituent part of northern Nigeria. For me as a Kanuri man, there a very thin line that divides me with someone from Katsina or Jigawa. I am a Kanuri with Fulani blood in my vein, so we are essentially one people having the same culture and religion.\n\nOn consensus, the former governor said: \u201ca lot of water has passed under the bridge. We are approaching the primaries in the next 72hours. Certainly, there are some aspirants that will step down for others where our candidate will emerge.\n\nIn fairness to the president, most of us governor when we were leaving the scene, we had input in who becomes our successor. The president is a democrat and he will allow the delegate to do needful.\n\nPeople are underrating his friendship with Tinubu. They have come a long way. If there\u2019s anyone with the array of contestants, Asiwaju is the leader among his mentees, If at all President Buhari will endorse anyone, it will Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This is the pay pack time. I believe our dear president.\n\nSpeaking on the fitness and wellness of Asiwaju Tinubu, the campaign director general said: \u201d Asiwaju is mentally elicit and alert. Leadership is not the ability to carry bags of cement but mental ability to come up with solutions. We are not preparing for the Olympics but governance.\n\n\u201cTinubu is physically and mentally fit to lead this country. He had knee injury but what is wrong about that. Asiwaju is even more fit than I am. I am diabetic, I cannot eat certain things but Asiwaju can.\u201d Senator Shettima said.",

          "text": "New scenarios have emerged, as permutations to find a running mate for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, intensifies.\n\nWhile persons like the Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and Senator Ben Bruce, have already joined the race, PDP stakeholders have started considering the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa and the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, as possible options for running mate.\n\nAlso, on the cards for consideration for the number two slot, are the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, and a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nThis is as the the South-east has made a strong case for compensation with the vice president slot, saying PDP could not deny the zone tickets for both president and vice-president.\n\nNevertheless, the governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, on Thursday, met Atiku with a wish list of areas he should focus on if elected Nigeria\u2019s next president.\n\nWike, Wednesday, reciprocated the visit to his residence by Atiku, when the governor visited the PDP presidential candidate at his Abuja residence. The implication of the visit was not lost on observers.\n\nSources said Wike\u2019s visit was part of the process of building unity in the party following a raucous campaign that preceded the PDP convention last weekend.\n\nThe visit came in the wake of increasing speculations that Wike might join the race for consideration as running mate to Atiku.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that some people in the party considered it unfair for the PDP not to pick Wike as running mate, especially, in view of his financial contributions and contacts he was able to build within a period of 90 days that he joined the race for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nMultiple sources told THISDAY that PDP was not oblivious of the fact that Wike could have defeated Atiku to become the presidential candidate, if not for the eleventh hour stand down by the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nThe quest for Wike to become the running mate to Atiku is being championed by the leadership of PDP in the South-south, headed by the National Vice Chairman, South-south, Dan Orbih.\n\nAn associate of Atiku, who was contacted on the development, refused to speak on the matter, but sources insisted that Wike\u2019s visit to Atiku was in return to Atiku\u2019s gesture on Monday.\n\nThe meeting with Wike was witnessed by Orbih and former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Mohammed Adoke (SAN).\n\nAside Wike, Ekweremadu and Bruce, party sources claimed, were also being considered as likely options, from both the South-east and South-south to balance the Atiku ticket.\n\nHowever, before the new calculations crept in, Okowa was believed to be the main person being considered for the position of vice president, with Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State as a distant prospect.\n\nThe consideration of Okowa, according to sources, flowed from his cross appeal to the South-south and the South-east geopolitical zones. While Emmanuel and Wike mobilised their state delegates to vote for them in the presidential primary, Okowa was said to have firmly backed Atiku with Delta State delegates voting 100 per cent.\n\nThose making a case for Okonjo-Iweala, argued that there was need for a trusted economist in the team to champion the boost for the economy. They recalled the role she played in the international creditors write-off of Nigeria\u2019s debt during the President Olusegun Obasanjo era.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cWhy we are advocating for Okonjo Iweala is basically because of his international connections and being a renowned economist. The economy is certainly in a bad shape and needs the touch of experienced persons in the management of the economy.\u201d\n\nIn the race too are both Udom and Anyim, also from South-south and South-east, as people, who could help the PDP make strong showing in the general elections, if paired with Atiku.\n\nPDP sources hinted that the party was already confused with loads of the options before it and was yet determine, which of the many choices it would embrace as complementary to the ticket in nearly all considerations for electoral victory.\n\nIkpeazu Meets Atiku, Lists Priority Areas\n\nGovernor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, on Thursday, met the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, with a list of priority areas Atiku should focus on if he emerges president. The meeting, which took place at the Abuja residence of Atiku, was said to be at the instance of the former vice president, in his bid to unite the main opposition party after the fractious presidential primary.\n\nChief press secretary to the Abia State governor, Onyebuchi Ememenka, in a press release after the meeting, said Ikpeazu assured Atiku of his personal commitment and those of the entire Abia PDP to work for the success of the party at the 2023 poll.\n\nHe counselled the PDP presidential candidate to prioritise the institutionalisation of inclusive governance, if he gets to Aso Rock, and specifically reminded Atiku that the people of the South-east currently \u201cfeel profoundly alienated from the scheme of things in the country, with no south easterner in the top echelons of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThis unprecedented state of affairs also persists in the entire security architecture of the country, including the paramilitary agencies as none of them is being headed by a person from the east for the first time in the history of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Abia chief executive also raised issues around ease of doing business in the country, which, according to him, ranked behind security among the most important things the South-east needs.\n\n\u201cAs natural business people, entrepreneurs and small scale manufacturers, the people of the South-east are interested in policies that will allow them do and grow their businesses,\u201d Ikpeazu said.\n\n\u2018Atiku\u2019s Presidency An Idea Whose Time Has Come\u2019\n\nCoalition of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Persons With Disabilities Support Group said former Vice President Atiku Abubakar\u2019s presidential bid was happening at a most auspicious time. The group vowed to actualise Atiku\u2019s presidency come 2023, adding that his knowledge of the economy would lead Nigeria out of poverty.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the PDP national secretariat, National Coordinator of the group, Dr. Chidi Olujie, said, \u201cThe special delegate convention to elect our presidential flag-bearer has strengthened our party and demonstrated our leader\u2019s readiness to take over the affairs of this country come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile I congratulate all party faithful on this predictable success, I equally charge all members, regardless of gender, disability, and age, to work harder to deliver all our candidates come 2023\n\n\u201cI want to formally, on behalf of the Coalition of PDP Persons with Disabilities Support Group, congratulate the 2023 PDP presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, GCON (Wazirin Adamawa) on his predictable victory at the just concluded special delegate convention. Your emergence didn\u2019t come to us as a surprise considering your political antecedent in reaching out to all and sundry.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that Atiku\u2019s presidency is an idea whose time has come and is ready to be validated by the Nigerian masses, come 2023. Persons with disabilities believe in your capacity, reckon with your experience and trust your knowledge of the economy and security in leading Nigeria out of the poverty and insecurity situation we found ourselves\n\n\u201cThe coalition recognises the efforts of all contenders in the last special delegate convention and sincerely appreciates them for deepening democratic ethos and practices within the party by participating in the election.\n\n\u201cHowever, we want to extend our appreciation to the governor and aspirant at the just concluded convention, His Excellency, Right Honourable Aminu Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto State, for his magnanimity and show of statesmanship for stepping down for Atiku Abubakar. This singular gesture will undoubtedly remain the cornerstone of our association as a party that is ready to take leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to engaging, mobilising, and actualising the Atiku presidency come 2023. Within our available resources, we shall sensitise, reorient, and educate the public, in general, and persons with disabilities, in particular, on the necessity of PDP coming back.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Thursday said despite significant progress made in the fight against tuberculosis (TB) epidemic in the country, there were still over 200,000 new tuberculosis infections occurring every year with the knowledge of health officials.\n\nThe revelation came just as government said there was a 15 per cent increase in tuberculosis notification from 120,266 cases in 2019, to 138,591 in 2020.\n\nSimilarly, stakeholders in the campaign against tuberculosis scourge in Nigeria have advocated for increased local funding for tuberculosis intervention programme.\n\nThe Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire who spoke at the launch of the compendium of best practices for tuberculosis control in Nigeria in Abuja, said though significant achievements had been recorded in the control of tuberculosis epidemic, there was need to step up commitment and to invest strategically across the nation, to scale up best practices.\n\n\u201cDespite significant progress in the past three years in our fight to end the tuberculosis epidemic, we know that there are still over 200,000 new TB infections occurring every year among us, yet to be detected and enrolled in treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are also significant numbers of TB deaths annually. We know that we must step up our commitment and invest strategically across the nation, to scale up best practices,\u201d he said.\n\nEhanire described the event as a remarkable one in the history of Tuberculosis control in Nigeria, adding that it afforded opportunity to showcase best practices that have enable the steady and marked increase in tuberculosis notification in Nigeria over the past few years.\n\nAccording to the minister, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was an 18 per cent drop globally in the number of tuberculosis cases diagnosed and notified, from 7.1 million in 2019, to 5.8 million in 2020.\n\nIn the same period, Ehanire also said tuberculosis deaths increased significantly as a result of reduced attention to treatment of patients.\n\nHe said Nigeria, as with many others countries, suffered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with negative socio-economic trends and health service disruptions. Ehanire further said following the introduction of lockdown measures for pandemic control in the second quarter of 2020, tuberculosis testing reduced by about 30 per cent, resulting in 17 per cent reduction in tuberculosis case finding and notification.\n\nThe minister however said with the implementation of innovative strategic interventions put in place by the tuberculosis programme managers, including the integration of tuberculosis control into COVID-19 response measures, there was a 15 per cent increase in tuberculosis notification from 120,266 cases in 2019, to 138,591 in 2020.\n\nHe said Nigeria was one of the few countries in the world to record an increase in tuberculosis case notification during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cFurther to this, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP) again recorded a remarkable increase in 2021 annual T notification, when numbers increased by 50 per cent, from 138,591 in 2020 to 207,785 in 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nEhanire said tuberculosis was curable, adding that the treatment was available free of charge in each and every one of the 774 Local Government Areas of Nigeria.\n\nHe expressed hope that the compendium would be a useful tool for all stakeholders, in the efforts to scale up tuberculosis control activities and to further maximise the yield from all our investments in tuberculosis control.\n\nThe National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme, headed Dr. Anyaike Chukwuma said Nigeria has achieved a milestone, from a situation of not being able to identify her prevalence level of tuberculosis infection to now being able to account for 45 per cent of the tuberculosis scourge.\n\nHe used the occasion to pay tribute to those Nigerians who have contributed significantly to the efforts to eradicate tuberculosis in Nigeria, especially the deceased.\n\nStakeholders from the Global Fund, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (HVN) and USAID all Canvassed for improved funding from preferably local sources to ensure that the fight against tuberculosis is sustained.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
