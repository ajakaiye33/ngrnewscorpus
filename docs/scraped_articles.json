          "title": "Understanding Type 2 Diabetes and How to cure it",
          "text": ".\n\nType 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which the levels of sugar, or glucose, build up in your bloodstream.\n\nTypically, the hormone insulin helps move glucose from your blood to your cells, where it\u2019s used for energy. But with type 2 diabetes, your body\u2019s cells aren\u2019t able to respond to insulin as well as they should. In later stages of the condition, your body may also not produce enough insulin.\n\nUncontrolled type 2 diabetes can lead to chronically high blood glucose levels, which can cause several symptoms and potentially lead to serious complications.\n\nSymptoms of type 2 diabetes\n\nIn type 2 diabetes, your body isn\u2019t able to effectively use insulin to bring glucose into your cells. This causes your body to rely on alternative energy sources in your tissues, muscles, and organs. This is a chain reaction that can cause a variety of symptoms.\n\nType 2 diabetes can develop slowly. The symptoms may be mild and easy to dismiss at first. The early symptoms may include:\n\nconstant hunger\n\na lack of energy\n\nfatigue\n\nexcessive thirst\n\nfrequent urination\n\nblurry vision\n\npain, tingling, or numbness in your hands or feet\n\nAs the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe and can cause some potentially dangerous complications.\n\nDiet for type 2 diabetes\n\nDiet is an important tool to help maintain optimal heart health and blood glucose levels that are within a safe range.\n\nThe diet recommended for people with type 2 diabetes is the same diet just about everyone should follow. It boils down to a few key actions:\n\nChoose a variety of foods that are high in nutrients and low in empty calories.\n\nWork on being mindful about portion sizes and stopping eating when you\u2019re full.\n\nRead food labels closely to understand the amount of sugar or carbs you could be ingesting in a serving size.\n\nFoods and beverages to limit\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, or even if you\u2019re trying to avoid diabetes and manage your weight, there are certain foods and beverages that you should limit if possible. These include:\n\nfoods heavy in saturated or trans fats (like red meat and full-fat dairy products)\n\nprocessed meats (like hotdogs and salami)\n\nmargarine and shortening\n\nrefined baked goods (like white bread and cake)\n\nhigh-sugar, highly processed snacks (packaged cookies and some cereals)\n\nsugary drinks (like regular soda and some fruit juices)\n\nWhile no one food, enjoyed every so often, should knock you off your healthy path, it\u2019s a good idea to talk with your doctor about dietary restrictions based on your blood sugar levels. Some people may need to monitor their glucose more carefully than others after eating these foods.\n\nCauses of type 2 diabetes\n\nInsulin is a naturally occurring hormone. Your pancreas produces it and releases it when you eat. Insulin helps transport glucose from your bloodstream to cells throughout your body, where it\u2019s used for energy.\n\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your body becomes resistant to insulin. Your body is no longer using the hormone efficiently. This forces your pancreas to work harder to make more insulin.\n\nOver time, this can damage cells in your pancreas. Eventually, your pancreas may not be able to produce any insulin.\n\nIf you don\u2019t produce enough insulin or if your body doesn\u2019t use it efficiently, glucose builds up in your bloodstream. This leaves your body\u2019s cells starved for energy. Doctors don\u2019t know exactly what triggers this series of events. It may have to do with cell dysfunction in the pancreas or with cell signaling and regulation.\n\nWhile lifestyle choices are typically what trigger type 2 diabetes, you may be more likely to be diagnosedTrusted Source with it if:\n\nthere\u2019s a genetic predisposition to developing type 2 diabetes in your family\n\nthere\u2019s a genetic predisposition to developing obesity in your family, which can increase the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes\n\nyou are at least 45 years old\n\nyou are Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, or of Alaska Native descent\n\nWhile the definitive trigger of type 2 diabetes is your body\u2019s resistance to insulin, there\u2019s usually a combination of factors that increase your risk of that resistance occurring.\n\nRisk factors for type 2 diabetes\n\nWhile there are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes that are out of your control (like your age and heritage, as mentioned above), there are certain lifestyle choices that can also put you at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Some of these include:\n\nLiving with excess weight. When you\u2019re living with excess weight, you most likely have more fatty tissue, which can make your cells more resistant to insulin.\n\nLiving a more sedentary lifestyle. Regular physical activity helps your cells respond better to insulin.\n\nEating a lot of highly processed foods. Highly processed foods can have a lot of hidden sugar and refined carbs. If your life requires a more \u201cgrab-and-go\u201d type of eating style, talk with your doctor or a dietician about nutritious swaps.\n\nYou may also be at increased risk if you\u2019ve had gestational diabetes or prediabetes, two conditions caused by elevated glucose levels.\n\nTips for preventing type 2 diabetes\n\nWhile you can\u2019t always prevent type 2 diabetes, there are a few lifestyle tweaks can help delay, or even prevent, the onset. This is true even if you have increased risk factors like prediabetes.\n\nDiet. The best kind of diet to prevent type 2 diabetes is a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, healthy carbs, healthy fats, and very little refined sugar.\n\nExercise. According to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for AmericansTrusted Source, the optimal amount of exercise a week for adults is 150 minutes, which can translate to 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. The Physical Activity Guidelines also recommend a combination of muscle strengthening and aerobic activity.\n\nWeight management. Keeping a moderate weight is a good way to avoid chronic complicationsTrusted Source, including type 2 diabetes.\n\nComplications associated with type 2 diabetes\n\nFor many people, type 2 diabetes can be effectively managed. If not properly managed, it can affect virtually all of your organs and lead to serious complications, including:\n\nskin problems, like bacterial or fungal infections\n\nnerve damage, or neuropathy, which can cause a loss of sensation or numbness and tingle in your extremities as well as digestive issues, like vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation\n\npoor circulation to the feet, makes it hard for your feet to heal when you have a cut or an infection and can also lead to gangrene and loss of the foot or leg\n\nHearing impairment retinal damage, or retinopathy, and eye damage, which can cause deteriorating vision, glaucoma, and cataracts cardiovascular diseases like high blood pressure, narrowing of the arteries, angina, heart attack, and stroke\n\nWomen with diabetes are more likely to have a heart attack, at a younger age, than women without diabetes\n\nMen with diabetes are 3.5 times as likely trusted Source to develop erectile dysfunction (ED)\n\nHyperglycemia\n\nHyperglycemia can happen when blood sugar is high. It\u2019s typically characterized by frequent urination and increased thirst. Monitoring your blood glucose carefully, and staying active, can help prevent hyperglycemia.\n\nComplications during and after pregnancy If you have diabetes while you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019ll need to monitor your condition carefully. Diabetes that\u2019s poorly controlled may: complicate pregnancy, labour, and delivery harm your baby\u2019s developing organs cause your baby to gain excess weight\n\nIt can also increase your baby\u2019s risk of developing diabetes during their lifetime.\n\nManaging type 2 diabetes\n\nManaging type 2 diabetes requires teamwork. You\u2019ll need to work closely with your doctor, but a lot of the results depend on your choices.\n\nYour doctor may want to perform periodic blood tests to determine your blood glucose levels. This will help determine how well you\u2019re managing the condition. If you take medication, these tests will help gauge how well it\u2019s working.\n\nYour doctor may also recommend a home monitoring system to test your own blood glucose levels between visits. They\u2019ll explain to you how often you should use it and what your target range should be.\n\nBecause diabetes can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, your doctor may want to monitor your blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. If you have symptoms of heart disease, you may need additional tests. These tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) or a cardiac stress test.\n\nIt may also be helpful to bring your family into the loop. Educating them about the warning signs of blood glucose levels that are too high or too low will allow them to help in an emergency.\n\nType 2 diabetes in children\n\nType 2 diabetes in children is a growing issue. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), around 193,000 Americans under age 20 have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n\nOne 2016 study found that the incidence of type 2 diabetes in youth has increased to about 5,000 new cases per year. Another study from 2017 also showed a significant increase, particularly in minority races and ethnic groups.\n\nIf your child has been diagnosed with diabetes, their doctor will need to determine if it\u2019s type 1 or type 2 before suggesting a specific treatment.\n\nIn the same way that lifestyle choices can help adults manage or even reverse their type 2 diabetes diagnosis, you can help lower your child\u2019s risk by encouraging them to eat well and to be physically active every day.\n\nTakeaway\n\nType 2 diabetes is a condition that\u2019s created when glucose levels build up in your bloodstream. It\u2019s a common condition that\u2019s often triggered by certain lifestyle choices. But the likelihood of a diagnosis can also be increased by genetics, age, and heritage.\n\nType 2 diabetes can be managed \u2014 and even reversed \u2014 with certain lifestyle changes. For more severe cases, medication is available.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, talk with your doctor about developing a treatment plan that works for your lifestyle. Because this condition is so common, there\u2019s a plethora of resources and first-person accounts to help you on your journey towards managing \u2014 or breaking free from \u2014 type 2 diabetes.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Adeola Badru\n\nA cleric, Rev James Owoyemi, has urged Christians to avoid bearing anger and always show mercy to one another to promote peaceful coexistence.\n\nOwoyemi, who is the President, of United Apostolic Church of Christ Worldwide, made the call in a sermon on Sunday at the training centre of the church located at Sabo, Mokola, Ibadan, during a thanksgiving service to mark the church\u2019s 57th Annual Pastors\u2019 Conference, with the theme: \u201cGoodness & Mercy.\u201d\n\nIn the sermon tilted: \u201cJudgment without mercy,\u201d he decried the attitude of bearing grudges and nursing anger and wrath for another, adding that total forgiveness could avert destruction and damage.\n\nHe advised Christians to endeavour to forgive an offender to obtain mercies of God.\n\nQuoting James 2 vs 10, he said: \u201cHe that takes vengeance will suffer vengeance from the Lord and he will firmly establish his sins.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive your neighbour the wrong he has done, and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want our people to know that they should have the mind of showing mercy. If our leaders have the mind of mercy, they will be ruling with the fear of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cMercy entails that you do things that will make others happy. Wat we are dating is that people should have the mind of mercy and when we do that individually, personally we will be growing, while people around us will be growing and the country as well will grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody wants mercy and not everybody is working in such a way to get mercy and according to the Lord who owns mercy, you must be merciful before you can get mercy,\u201d he posited.\n\nWhile speaking on the country\u2019s leadership, the man of God was optimistic that a time was coming when a God-fearing will rule the country.\n\n\u201cWe are praying towards that and when we are praying towards a thing, we should believe such a thing will come to pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a God-fearing leader is ruling us in the country, then things will go the way they should. These people will rule with the fear of God,\u201d Rev. Owoyemi submitted.\n\nThe church\u2019s annual conference was kick-started on Thursday, March 17, 2022, with a world interactive session which was followed by an open crusade, held at the Adamasingba Stadium, Ibadan.\n\nThe conference was rounded off with a thanksgiving service on Sunday.\n\nOfficers of the church who were in attendance include, wife of the president, Rev (Mrs) Mary Owoyemi; the Administrative Secretary, Pastor Joseph Oluwatuwase; General Evangelist, Evang.

          "text": "** Why Senate rejected Buhari\u2019s amendment\n\n** Section 84 (12) codifies the norm of our society\n\n** I\u2019m the best person to succeed Ikpeazu as Abia governor\n\n** APC has nothing to offer South-East, Nigeria\n\n** South-East has credible people who can bring Nigeria back from the brink\n\n** PDP looks good to win presidency in 2023\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nSenate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, PDP, bia South, in this interview spoke on the gains of 2022 Electoral Act, why the Senate threw out President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s bill to delete Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, the South-East clamour for the presidency in 2023, and why he wants to succeed Governor Pkezie Ikpeazu in Abia as governor in 2023.\n\nHis take on the 2022 Electoral Act\n\nIt is a good piece of legislation. It was meant to cure some of the problems that were in the previous acts all this while. And the basic thing that we have in the Electoral Act today is the fact that it will make rigging almost impossible. There are two things that were done in that Electoral Act. First is the direct transmission of results in each polling unit. Even if you have problems in a polling unit, the cumulative of all the polling booths will give you a nearly accurate figure. And also, there is a provision in the Act that if you, by any means, force a Returning Officer to announce a result that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) does not have, that set of results will not be processed.\n\nThe other thing about the Electoral Act, which is good, is the very famous one, which everyone saw when the Senate rejected President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s amendment, which is section 84(12). What that section does is that it codified what was already supposed to be the norm of our society. Usually, if you want to run for election, the norm used to be that you would resign. You won\u2019t sit in office and at the same time utilise your office to run and manipulate state resources in running for election.\n\nThere is an aspect of that legislation, which people talk about, which I do not think is in the law. I have heard it said that, if you have not resigned by now, you might not be eligible to contest; that you ought to have resigned. No law is made to be retroactive, so Section 84(12) doesn\u2019t say that you ought to have resigned by now. What is actually in the law is that if you are going to be a delegate for the purpose of primary or you are going to be an aspirant or a contestant for the purpose of primary, leading to an election that you will have to resign. The stipulation as to time is what is in the Civil Service Rules because you are a public officer and you are subjected to the same Civil Service Rules, which is 30 days before any contest.\n\nSo, it is actually 30 days before primary or 30 days before congress if you are going to be a delegate. It is not for three months. Now the parties haven\u2019t set their dates; when the parties set their dates, I believe the 30 days will now kick-start from the date the parties put for their elections. That is what is in 84(12).\n\nThe president, in his wisdom, has said that it conflicted with the 1999 Constitution, where that particular part of the constitution wasn\u2019t mentioned. So, we didn\u2019t know exactly what he meant. As far as we know, we think that if you are in office and you still want to be in that office and also run or contest for an election, what you are doing is that you are short-changing the country because your office will suffer. And of course, when you are running for office, what it means is that you are going to neglect your official duties, and you swore an oath to fulfil your duty towards the public and towards Nigeria, so you cannot balance the two at the same time. It is not going to be in the interest of the country. The interest of the country should come first.\n\nSo when we got that communication from the president, we said some people must have mis-advised him to write that letter. For example, I run the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, and I now want to be president and then I want to contest for primary while I am still running the NNPC, something is going to suffer. And what is going to suffer actually is my job for the people of Nigeria in the NNPC. We should not allow that. We just didn\u2019t think that these are things that we ought to codify, but we have found out that because it wasn\u2019t codified people were taking advantage of it and staying in their offices and utilising the office to run elections and of course, to the detriment of their duties. That was why we declined to put an assent to it.\n\nWhy do you want to become the next governor of the state?\n\nMy reason is simple: Abia State deserves the best possible material to lead it and I think I am the best person at this time to lead the state. This is the 21st century; this is also a transition year and this is also a year where so many things are happening both in Nigeria and all over the world. And what Abia needs now is a man that has integrity. Abia needs a man that has credibility, a man that has the capacity to do the job and Abia needs somebody, who at all times the people can go to sleep and say they know that Abia is in very good hands.\n\nI am putting myself forward for Abia people to be the governor for all, not the governor of the North, South, East or West, but the governor for every Abia person. And I think that with the pedigree I have and with what I have done for the people of Abia and indeed, the people of Nigeria, all the oppressed people in this country know that I put them first in everything, that I will do a great job for them.\n\nThis will be your fourth or fifth attempt, do you think people will give you their votes this time?\n\nI think that what is important is the adage: if you try and it doesn\u2019t work, then you try again. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times I have made attempts, I think that this is the right time and Abia people know and I have their support and their encouragement. I have had consultations with all persons in Abia, all manner of people; I have had with the leadership, I have had with the led, market women, with the youths, I have had with the political leaders, I have had with academia, I have had with all. And every point I have met with them, Abians asked for one thing: leadership that puts them first and I intend to do that.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress, APC, is trying to get a foothold of the South-East. What do you think are the chances of the PDP for the presidency and to retain power in Abia?\n\nI don\u2019t think the APC has had a foothold of the South-East. What the APC has done, just like they have done elsewhere, is to poach the leadership that is already there from the PDP and when they poach them, they give them a lot of bogus promises, which they never kept. So, at all times, the PDP will always win the South-East; we have no problem about that. It is obvious that the APC has nothing to offer the South-East and we repeat not just the South-East; the APC has nothing to offer the country. What will they offer you? Is it fuel that is at N600 per litre? You can\u2019t fly, diesel is at almost N800 per litre. And of course the worst, which is that we are in the middle of rising oil prices at the international market, yet we are still crying that Nigeria is not benefitting from the development. This has never happened. At least, everybody can say that when there is rising oil prices, we can no longer borrow; we can pay our debts; we can reduce the deficit but none of that is happening, we are not saving and we are doing nothing. We should ask ourselves one question and that question is this: what manner of economic management does the APC do that has led us to this type of Nigeria where nothing, literally nothing, is working and the country is grinding to a halt? When we asked this question, we were told that the real problem is that we are paying subsidies. Two things we can take from here; this same APC said that there was nothing like subsidy. This same President Buhari said subsidy was a scam, yet subsidy has risen under this government three times or four times more than subsidy under President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s PDP government that they persecuted so much.\n\nWe should ask ourselves another question: how did the consumption of Prime Motor Spirit, PMS, rise under APC from the 28 million to 30 million litres a day under (Dr Ibe) Kachukwu as minister to about 100 million litres a day under the present leadership of the APC? Something is definitely wrong. How can, within three to four years, you tell us that the consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria has quadrupled; how could that be? So, what we see is something that is inexplicable. The United States has an energy department that has the consumption rate of all fuel you use all over the world. If you check their figures, the whole of West Africa doesn\u2019t take up to 35 million of litres a day, the whole of West Africa and you tell me that Nigeria takes over 100 million litres a day and we are paying subsidies on this phantom figures. So, there are things we cannot explain. We all know that the APC has nothing to offer an average man in the South-East, who finds it very difficult to do business, who finds it very difficult to move about, even if he is an importer he has to come to Lagos and the cost of moving his goods to Abia is costlier than what he used to bring it from Europe to Lagos. So, how would anybody survive in this kind of condition? And now after everything they told us that if they remove the PDP from power, they will now give us electricity. I think that was what Mr (Babatunde) Fashola said then.\n\nNow, they are telling us that electricity has fallen because it is the dry season and that the water level has fallen. The same thing they complained about under the PDP. So, you can see that these people came to power on the basis of an issue of propaganda, misinformation, lies and everything, they can no longer sustain it. Therefore, there is nothing for Nigerians to look forward to other than to bring the PDP back so that we can restore the country the same way we restored it from 1999 to 2015.\n\nWhat is your take on the Igbo quest for the presidency? Will your party, PDP consider the region for its presidential ticket?\n\nYes, we are clamouring for a president from our zone because we think that every other part of Nigeria has had a shot at the presidency. But beyond that, we think that we have credible, competent and very qualified persons within the PDP from the South-East who can lead Nigeria and take it out of the problem that it has today. And we are also encouraging them that they should come out and contest; they should talk to people from every part of Nigeria because to take the clich\u00e9, power is not served ala carte. I am sure that we have many credible people from the South-East that can bring Nigeria back from the brink and the PDP looks good to win the presidency in 2023.\n\nQuote\n\nIt is obvious that the APC has nothing to offer the South-East and we repeat not just the South-East; the APC has nothing to offer the country. What will they offer you? Is it fuel that is at N600 per litre? You can\u2019t fly, diesel is at almost N800 per litre. And of course the worst, which is that we are in the middle of rising oil prices at the internet",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has cut interest rates on all intervention facilities from nine to five per cent per annum.\n\nThe regulatory forbearance would allow banks to restructure loans given to sectors severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and strengthen the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy, which has resulted in a significant rise in loans provided by financial institutions.\n\nIn a circular released at the weekend, the apex bank said the move was to address the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Nigerian economy.\n\nCBN Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department, Chibuzo Efobi, explained that in uncertain times, there was always a way to ensure that businesses survived, including granting forbearance.\n\nHe said the regulatory forbearance also includes restructuring of credit facilities impacted by Covid-19.\n\nIn the circular addressed to all banks and other financial institutions, Efobi said the extension of the five per cent per annum interest rate on all CBN intervention facilities was for one year, adding that the policy took effect retrospectively from February 28, 2022.\n\nCBN\u2019s data showed that total gross credit to businesses rose from N19.4 trillion to N23.5 trillion in the last one year, representing over 21.1 per cent increase.\n\nIn a state of the economy and financial sector report, the apex bank said agriculture, manufacturing, power and healthcare took the lion share of the loans disbursed.\n\nThe loans to benefit from the interest rate cut include N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors of which 53 major manufacturing projects, 21 agriculture-related projects and 13 service projects are being funded.\n\nThe list also includes the N100 billion intervention fund for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners meant to expand and strengthen the capacity of the healthcare institutions that will also benefit from the fund.\n\nThe N50 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises will also benefit from the forbearance policy will equally benefit from the policy shift.\n\nThe CBN also earlier approved regulatory forbearance for restructuring of credit facilities in the Other Financial Institutions (OFIs) sub-sector to further mitigate the impact of the pandemic on households, businesses and regulated institutions.\n\nIt said OFls were granted leave to consider temporary and time-limited restructuring of the tenor and loan terms for households and businesses affected by Covid-19, subject to the issued guidelines for restructuring affected credit facilities in the OFI sub-sector.\n\nOther specific policy measures, outside loans, undertaken to stabilise the economy and businesses in the face of the pandemic include the reduction of the monetary policy rate from 13.5 to 11.5 per cent to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nThe CBN said it will continue to monitor developments and implement appropriate measures to safeguard financial stability and support stakeholders impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe CBN increased the required minimum LDR to 60 per cent in July 2019 and further reviewed it forward to 65 per cent later in the year.\n\nThe LDR policy was meant to ensure that banks lend at least 65 of their deposits to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) or be sanctioned.\n\nThe apex bank noted a significant increase in the size of gross credit by Deposit Money Banks to customers, hence retaining it at 65 per cent in January 2020.\n\nAlthough the policy contributed to increasing lending to the economy but did not substantially bring about a reduction in the cost of funds. This means that, despite increased access to credit, Nigerians are still paying as much interest rates to the commercial banks.",

The party ought to have decided on zoning, before the sale of forms. Now, they want people to begin to buy forms. While the zoning committee will submit its report in two weeks. And by that time, the sale of forms would have closed.\n\n\u201cSo, what happens if the committee decides to zone the presidential ticket to a particular part of the country? Would the party refund people who are not from that part of the country, who may have bought the forms? The whole thing is just confusing.\u201d\n\nHowever, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunabga, when contacted, told Sunday Sun that there is no cause for alarm.\n\nOlogunagba expressed optimism that the zoning committee, which may be inaugurated tomorrow, will address the issue in a manner that would be satisfactory to all the stakeholders.\n\nHe added that the PDP as a party is always guided by its rules and the constitution of the country in its activities.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done, because we are a family that discusses issues with honesty and taking into consideration the situation of the country and where we are, what we did was to set up a committee to ensure that all interests, all issues relating to zoning are discussed fully.\n\n\u201cAnd you will recall the membership of this committee is drawn from across the country, one member representing each state.

Though the party gave no reason for not commencing the exercise as scheduled, it was learnt that the aspirants were still returning their forms as of 7 p.m. last night.\n\nWith the delay in the commencement of the screening, the seven chairmanship aspirants are expected to be screened on Monday.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Chairman of Venue, Decoration, and Site Servicing Committee for the National Convention and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong has promised adequate security and logistics for the event.\n\nChairmanship aspirants who beat the deadline for the submission of nomination forms were two former governors of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; Senator Sani Mohammed Musa; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Abdulaziz Yari; and the youngest aspirant, Mr. Etsu Mohammed.\n\n\n\nYari, who is from the North-west, is the only aspirant that is not from the North-central, which is expected to produce the party\u2019s national chairmanship, according to the zoning arrangement.\n\nYari\n\nYari was a two-term Governor of Zamfara State and a one-time Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), a position that gave him a lot of influence and respect among his former colleagues and some serving governors. He has the resources and political experience.\n\n\n\nIf antecedents are anything to go by, then it would be difficult for Yari to realise his ambition. The way Yari managed the 2018 primaries before the 2019 elections caused all the APC candidates in the state to lose the elections to the PDP. Also, his inability to curtail bandits during his tenure as the governor of Zamfara State was a disaster. Today, bandits have almost crippled not only the state but the nation. The defection of the current Governor Bello Matawalle to the ruling APC is seen by political watchers as a threat to his aspirations. Matawalle is reportedly not on the same page with Yari. The zoning arrangement of APC is also not in his favour.\n\nSaliu Mustapha\n\nHe is the Turaki of Ilorin. Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the founder of Saliu Mustapha Foundation (SMF) which is involved in huge philanthropic services.\n\nA die-hard Buharist, Mustapha paid his dues in political party administration. He was once a national deputy chairman of the defunct CPC, one of the legacy parties that formed the APC. His membership of the defunct CPC gave him an edge as both ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it is the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\nHis weakness is that he lacks leadership experience as he has never held any other political appointment apart from the deputy chairman of the defunct CPC.\n\nGeorge Akume\n\nAkume was a two-term governor of Benue State, former senator, and a serving Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs. With these positions, he has acquired enough leadership experience to manage the diverse interests of the ruling party.\n\nAs a cabinet member, he can also galvanise the support of some of his colleagues to realise his ambition. He also has the intellectual and mental capacity required to battle for the national chairmanship seat. His major weak point was the loss of APC in the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nAl-Makura is also a former Nasarawa State Governor. The 69-year-old businessman-turned-politician is also keen on becoming the next APC chairman. As a former governor and serving Senator, Al-Makura has the required resources, experience, and network to become the next national chairman. Al-Makura has running battles with the EFCC. Last year, he visited the EFCC headquarters a couple of times to answer questions on money laundering running into billions of naira. The former governor, however, said he was only invited by the EFCC but was never detained.\n\nAbdullahi Adamu\n\nAdamu was the pioneer Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and the current senator representing Nasarawa West senatorial district in the National Assembly.\n\nAdamu was governor of Nasarawa State from May 29, 1999, to May 29, 2007. He is believed to have been anointed as the consensus national chairman but the other contestants have refused to accept his nomination.\n\nAs a third-term senator and former governor, he has the enormous experience to pilot the affairs of the ruling party.\n\nAt 75, some party leaders believe Adamu is too old to be in the race, taking into cognisance the complex nature of the job.\n\nSani Mohammed Musa\n\nThe 54-year-old member of the upper chamber of the National Assembly represents Niger East senatorial district. He has a good relationship with party members. Two governors were said to have recommended him to President Muhammadu Buhari as a consensus candidate. However, he does not have the necessary experience as a party administrator.\n\nEtsu Mohammed\n\nAt just 37, Mohammed is the youngest of all the aspirants. He is an aide to Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State and a former youth leader of the defunct ANPP. Not much is known about him politically.\n\nIyiola Omisore\n\nFor the position of the National Secretary of the party, zoned to the South-west, a former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore has also submitted his nomination form. Omisore was a senator from 2003 to 2011. A former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, and an Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele are also in the race but it was not clear if they had submitted their forms as of last night.\n\nAdebayo Shittu\n\nA former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu is the first person to indicate interest in the office of APC National Secretary. However, Shittu\u2019s aspiration did not garner the support of the APC governors in the South-west. That did not deter him from pursuing his aspiration, leveraging on his goodwill with Buhari\u2019s political allies.\n\nShittu, a member of the 2005 National Political Reform Conference, has been an ally of Buhari.\n\nIfe Oyedele\n\nExecutive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele, is another aspirant for the office of APC National Secretary. Before he was appointed NDPHC\u2019s executive director in charge of Engineering &Technical Services, little was known about Oyedele. Like Shittu, he has been close to the political family of the president since the time of the defunct CPC.\n\n\n\nHe was among the key persons that promoted Buhari\u2019s presidential aspiration in 2011. At its formation, Oyedele served on the CPC Constitution Drafting Committee and also represented the party during the alliance talk in 2011 and merger talks that produced the APC in 2013. He also contested the governorship election in Ondo State in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\n\nThe position of the Deputy National Chairman (North) is being contested by Mr. Sunny Monidafe, and Senator Abubakar Girei, while the National Vice Chairman (South-south) is being contested by Mr. Yekini Nabena, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC.\n\n\n\nMr. Ismaeel Ahmed and Abubakar Fakai are contesting for the post of National Organising Secretary, while Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke and Afeez Bolaji Repete, are jostling for the position of the National Vice Chairman (South-west)\n\nFor the position of the National Women Leader, Mary Eta and Hellen Effiong are in the race for the job.\n\n\n\nThe position of the Zonal Organising Secretary (South-west) is being contested by Mr. Femi Egbedeyi, while Mr. Olusegun Dada and Rinsola Abiola are in the race for the position of the National Youth Leader.\n\nThe Deputy National Youth Leader is being contested by Jamal Kabiru, while the Zonal Organising Secretary (North-West) is being contested by Salihu Uba.\n\n\n\nHalima Ibrahim is contesting for the position of the Deputy National Women Leader of the APC. This list is however not exhausting as more aspirants were still returning their forms last night.\n\nWe Will Provide Adequate Security, Logistics for Convention, Says Lalong\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Venue, Decoration and Site Servicing committee, and Plateau State Governor, Lalong has promised a hitch-free convention.\n\n\n\nA statement by Lalong\u2019s director of press, Simon Macham quoted the governor as saying, \u201cWe are working closely with the committees on security, protocol, and others to ensure that there is a synergy which will lead to the conduct of a hitch-free exercise.\u201d\n\n\n\nLalong had led members of the committee to Eagle Square Abuja, the venue of the proposed convention to inspect the facility and also interface with the management.\n\nHe said the Committee would have started making arrangements at the venue before now, but for the Science and Technology Expo which just ended at the same venue.\n\n\n\nLalong however said he had been meeting and engaging relevant stakeholders to ensure that the plans for the venue and associated services are put in place for the comfort of delegates and officials during the APC convention.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Northern group rallies support for CBN gov\u2019s presidency\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi, Uzoma Mba in Lagos and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nA civil society organisation, Save Nigeria Project (SNP), has alleged that desperate politicians have approached it and other credible groups to launch a million-dollar smear campaign against President Muhammadu Buhari; his economic agenda, as well as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele and his monetary policies.\n\nThis is coming as the Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum (UNNYF) yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nSNP disclosed the alleged smear campaign plot yesterday at a World Press Conference on 2023 and the State of the Nation, held in Lagos, which had in attendance, representatives from Arewa Consultative Youth Movement, All Progressives Congress (APC) Young Professionals Movement, and Niger Delta Youth Vanguard.\n\n\n\nOthers include the Yoruba Council of Youths, Igbo Youth Movement, Middle Belt Youth Movement, South East Youth Assembly and Lawyers in Defence of Democracy.\n\nSNP Convener, Mr Peter Abang, said they alerted the public to disregard the smear campaigns once they kicked off.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Save Nigeria Project will also take advantage of this briefing to alert the world on the activities of desperate politicians ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have been approached and we believe, many other credible groups have also been approached by some desperate politicians of questionable character with a pool of funds of up to one million Dollars to be allegedly shared by consenting groups for a massive smear campaign against the person of President Buhari, his economic agenda, the person and office of Mr Godwin Emefiele and his policies in the CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have outrightly rejected the offer. Nigerians should note that once this condemnable project starts, they should disregard it and treat them with the disdain they deserve,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said part of the plan by those behind the plot was to clone and impersonate credible groups to churn out lies and misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\n\nPassing a vote of confidence on President Buhari, SNP said the country has been on a steady march towards development since 2015, adding that more infrastructural growth has been recorded than at any other time.\n\n\u201cThe unprecedented revolution in the agricultural sector cannot be overemphasised in discussing the state of the nation today.\n\n\n\n\u201cUntil President Buhari came to power, no Nigerian had ever seen massive pyramids built with only rice paddy.\n\n\u201cNigeria was never rated as a global producer of rice before 2015 but now it is a super force in global rice production and no longer a dumping ground for spoilt unhealthy rice from Asia and other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cOn the economic front, we note that the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that inflation is going down. This shows a positive trajectory and recovery for the economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough the various Social Intervention Programmes now domiciled in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, the federal government has lifted millions out of penury and joblessness into economic productivity and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe economy has also expanded and fortified against global shocks in record time, beating the projection of financial experts, the country has exited recession. Available data also show economic growth which is more than the projections.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is given this favourable assessment of our country\u2019s leadership and the state of the nation this first quarter of 2022 that we as a civil society organisation pass a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari, his economic agenda and the monetary policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria ably led by Mr Godwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele\u201d.\n\nThe group commended APC for \u201czoning power to the South in the interest of peace and inclusiveness,\u201d urging other political parties to do the same.\n\n\n\nIt said the country should have a president that would continue to consolidate and expand the vision, as well as the landmark legacy of Buhari, adding that a thorough professional of Igbo extraction should succeed the president next year.\n\n\n\nSNP also called on Buhari to support a candidate who embodies a winnable personality and ticks all the numerous boxes, adding that it should be someone he would be proud of.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is after a very rigorous search that we have come to the unequivocal and emphatic conclusion that only one man fits this description and we make bold to present to Mr President for his endorsement and to Nigerians for their massive support, Mr Godwin, Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for President, 2023. Emefiele has shown unprecedented sagacity as Governor of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis initiatives for small, medium and large scale enterprises have been unprecedented. In manufacturing, oil and gas, agriculture, trade and commerce, the signature of the CBN Governor has been very clear and precise.\n\n\u201cThe numerous interventions of the bank under high standard supervision is second to none. Rice farmers in our country have never had it so good in our entire history,\u201d the group added.\n\nNorthern Group Rallies Support for Emefiele\u2019s Presidency\n\nIn a related development, a northern group, UNNYF yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nAddressing stakeholders in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, the spokesperson of the youth group, Mr Aliyu Muhammad Sani, said the forum has been going around some states in the North for consultations with relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\nSani explained that the youth group embarked on the consultation to produce a credible, competent, and economically-endowed leader that would consolidate on rapid economic growth that the CBN governor had already started in his current position.\n\n\n\n\u201cI stand to be corrected, but I dare boldly to say that, Mr Godwin Emefiele\u2019s achievements have reflected in all states of the country and are there for history and posterity to judge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt never came easy; it was not done at his comfort zone, rather, it took a lot of courage, foresight, perseverance, determination, and hard work to overcome the numerous challenges scavenging on the fragile economy of our dear nation,\u201d Sani said.\n\n\n\nHe concluded that Emefiele had contained and dealt with a 60 per cent decline in the price of crude oil.\n\nIn a remark, the Nasarawa State Coordinator for UNNYF for Emefiele 2023, Mr Faruk Mohammed Ofoku, said the Lafia consultation became necessary considering the youthful inclusion of Nasarawa youth in the decision-making process in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe good people of Nasarawa State benefited so much from the good stewardship of the current CBN Governor. Nasarawa is the home of solid minerals; Mr Emefiele\u2019s policies of diversification invested so much in solid mineral resources and agriculture.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking at all these economic and life-saving interventions of the CBN Governor in Nasarawa State and all other northern states, we the progressive Northern Nigerian Youth of Nasarawa State joined the National leadership of our Coalition and strongly call on Mr Godwin Emefiele to please, as matter of urgency, declare to run for the President of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Ofoku explained.\n\nOfoku said their call was timely because the Nasarawa youths wanted their economy, especially mining and agriculture, to be rejuvenated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Buni, secretary at party\u2019s HQ, continue \u2018preparations along line of scheduled activities\u2019\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Bello Kawu of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), sitting at Kubwa, yesterday vacated an order of his court restraining the All Progressives Congress (APC), from going ahead with its planned National Convention, pending the hearing and determination of a suit against its conduct.\n\n\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC, Mai Mala Buni, met with his supposedly sacked Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, at the party\u2019s secretariat, thus dispelling the rumour that the latter had been removed.\n\nJustice Kawu vacated the order stalling APC\u2019s National Convention following an application by the party to that effect.\n\n\n\nAn aggrieved member of the APC, Salisu Umoru, had approached the court for an exparte order of injunction to temporarily restrain the defendants, which included the APC; Chairman of CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni; and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting the planned convention slated for March 26, 2021.\n\n\n\nJustice Kawu, having found the application meritorious on November 18, 2021 granted the other.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied and desirous of working in accordance with the timetable of INEC, the APC early in March, this year, approached the court to set aside the said order so as to pave a way for the conduct of the scheduled convention.\n\n\n\nDelivering ruling in the application as moved by Shuaib Aruwan, SAN, Justice Bello Kawu, held that the Plaintiff lacked the locus to sustain the restraining order.\n\nAccording to the judge, the order of injunction issued against the APC on November 18, 2021, had been overtaken by a recent judgment the Supreme Court delivered on a similar matter.\n\n\n\nHe subsequently vacated the order and adjourned the Plaintiff\u2019s substantive suit till March 30 for hearing.\n\nJustice Kawu had on November 18, 2021, while ruling in an exparte application, halted the APC convention to enable him reach a decision in the originating summons by Honourable Salisu Umoru challenging the planned convention.\n\n\n\nIn the case with suit number FCT/HC/CV/2958/2021 and motion number FCT/HC/M/9655/21, the plaintiff prayed the court for an Order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants and their agents from organising, holding or conducting the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress in January and February or at any other date either before or after, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe Plaintiff had, among other things, prayed the court to direct the APC and its CECPC Chairman, to halt further action on the planned convention, pending the resolution of legal cases involving the party.\n\n\n\nHe equally sought an order directing Buni to begin the reconciliation process to resolve all the disputes that emanated from the local government congresses that were conducted by the party.\n\nIn granting the request last November, the judge warned that the subject matter of the case was now subjudice and must not be tampered with.\n\nAkpanudoedehe Remains Secretary\n\n\n\nBuni met with Akpanudoedehe yesterday at the party\u2019s secretariat, thus dispelling the rumour that the latter had been sacked.\n\nAides of Buni pushed out photographs from the meeting and unofficially confirmed that Akpanudoedehe had resumed as secretary and that the two men met \u201cto continue preparations along the line of scheduled activities.\u201d\n\n\n\nA source at the meeting added: \u201cContrary to reports claiming that CECPC had removed its secretary, the leadership of the party has declared that his office remains intact. In line with President Buhari\u2019s directive that things should go back to status quo, Akpanudoedehe remains the Secretary.\n\n\n\nIn an interview yesterday, Akpanudoedehe also confirmed that he remains the party\u2019s secretary, noting that President Buhari\u2019s directive that status quo ante be maintained, solidified that position.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cOur Chairman (Buni) cannot go against the instruction of the President. In his last letter, the President has given the directive that the status quo ante should remain. The Chairman is a very brilliant man, he respects the President and will not go against that.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am the National Secretary of APC and the Constitution is very clear on that. The INEC has said for you to sack any of us, you need 21 days\u2019 notice. I want to also thank the APC for giving content to the media houses to sell their papers. We have promoted your economy in the last month.\n\n\n\n\u201cI should be celebrated for standing with the Chairman. We should celebrate loyalty, integrity. You can only celebrate good. Why would I be punished for standing with the chairman? It is a virtue. So, nothing has changed in APC. I remain the National Secretary and reconciliation efforts are ongoing. It is one party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Buni-led APC caretaker committee has continued efforts at reconciling aggrieved members of the party ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\nReconciliatory efforts, it was gathered, were to ensure that the forthcoming Convention is seamless and that party stakeholders and members are united for a successful outing at the convention and at the general elections.\n\nBuni was said to have started meeting with aggrieved Chieftains of the party across board in this regard.\n\nFor months, there has been internal wrangling in the party over the National Convention.\n\nThere were allegations that Buni had perfected plans to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention in order to remain as Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBuni and John Akpanudoedehe, CECPC\u2019s Secretary, were alleged to have used a third party to obtain the court order temporarily restraining the ruling party from holding its convention until the substantive suit is heard and determined.\n\n\n\nNasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna, on March 9, alleged that Buni\u2019s lawyers colluded with a petitioner to \u201cdestroy\u201d the National Convention.\n\nHe described the said court order as a \u201chidden nuclear weapon\u201d that would have hampered the party\u2019s chances in the 2023 general election.\n\nLast Thursday, Buni, who returned to Abuja, and back to his job as caretaker chair, after the failed coup to remove him, said the party was at the finishing line of its preparations for the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\nHe also thanked his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Bello, for his efforts while he was away.\n\nBuni\u2019s comments came after his return from a medical trip to Dubai and meeting with President Buhari in London over the leadership crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe leaders, who met at the Yobe State Governors\u2019 Lodge in Asokoro, were flanked by members of the caretaker committee except for Akpanudoedehe.\n\n\n\nBuni stated, \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our National Convention, which is at hand. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 National Convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Akpanudoedehe\u2019s absence from the meeting, Buni explained, \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of the CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not a formal meeting that one will ask whether the secretary is here or not. However, he was in the house earlier today.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a separate statement, Buni pledged not to reverse the decisions taken in his absence, especially with regards to the membership of the sub-committees set up to plan the convention.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the APC had released a new list of the sub-committees showing that there had been a minor shake-up.\n\nIn a statement shortly after, however, Buni said he would not be reversing the actions of Bello and asked members of the public to discountenance the new list.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Bianca \u2018stunned by the stench of whisky on Obiano\u2019s wife\u2019s breath\u2019\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nThe Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, Eze Uzu III of Awka, Austin Ndigwe yesterday declared that Ebelechukwu, wife of former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano had desecrated Awka by fighting Bianca, widow of late Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu and that the Gods of the Kingdom must be appeased.\n\nAlso yesterday, Bianca issued a statement about the fight, alleging that Ebelechukwu was drunk when she attacked her.\n\n\n\nA fight that broke out last Thursday between the two women during the inauguration of Professor Charles Soludo as Governor resulted in Bianca slapping Ebelechukwu.\n\nEze Ndigwe also ordered Ebelechukwu to apologise to Bianca within seven days to avoid consequences.\n\nThe Obi of Awka, in his press release, said he had given Ebelechukwu seven days to publicly apologise to the entire Igbo people or face serious consequences.\n\n\n\nHe said the action of the wife of the former governor was sacrilegious, and that as the monarch of the town, he would have to appease the gods of Awka land to avoid calamities.\n\nThe monarch said: \u201cShe should also tender an unreserved apology to the new Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo for her disgraceful conduct during his inauguration. The same should go for the chief judge of the state who was conducting the swearing in when she descended.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis grave sin was committed in the land of Awka which is known for peace and unity. Therefore, as the traditional ruler of the people and chief custodian of our culture, I am under obligation to perform some sacrifices to cleanse our land of this filth and pollution and to appease the gods.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Obi of Awka said he had long spoken to Bianca who told him that what angered her was that Mrs. Obiano walked up to her and called her unprintable names, including querying her presence at the swearing in ceremony.\n\nHe added that a study of the scenario showed that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was deliberate, as she came very much prepared to disrupt the swearing in ceremony.\n\n\n\nNdigwe added that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was not only against Mrs. Ojukwu, but also against the late Ojukwu, who is the founder of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), whom his widow came to represent.\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that Bianca was not at that ceremony as Bianca, but as a direct representative of our late father and leader, Chief Odumegwu-Ojukwu, her late husband who pioneered APGA.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, Ebele\u2019s action of casting aspersions on her is an affront on the entire Igbo people. It was indeed on Odumegwu-Ojukwu and not on Bianca as a person. This is an insult on Igbo and it must not go unpunished.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that I took Obiano and his wife, Ebere to Bianca Ojukwu where they knelt down while seeking the party\u2019s governorship ticket. Bianca endorsed Obiano and called on all APGA members, including then Governor Obi to support him. Mrs. Obiano has only seven days to apologise as demanded and directed or face serious consequences.\u201d\n\nBianca \u2018Stunned By the Stench of Whisky on Obiano\u2019s Wife\u2019s Breath\u2019\n\nBianca issued a statement yesterday, stating that all guests were seated when Ebelechukwu arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the inauguration ceremony was on and that she didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her.\n\n\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain and the Vatican continued: Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language. She asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe held onto her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA chairman, Chief Umeh, told her to leave me and told enraged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode, completely speechless. What struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9am? It is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis was highly embarrassing to the governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him. Luckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He received funds from Amaechi and CBN governor to fund the litigation and find the judge to do so as Abuja Federal Court judges refused to touch the case,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF (Malami) was being asked to resign as of last week.

Equiano is expected to land in South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena later in the year, connecting the continent with Europe.\n\nThis announcement marks a milestone in Google\u2019s plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Last October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa, of which project Equiano is part of.\n\nMap of Africa indicating Lisbon, Togo, and Cape Town landings with branching units\n\nFor Togo which currently ranks as the sixth-best country in Africa regarding ease of doing business, the landing of Equiano opens up more possibilities and opportunities. It\u2019s expected that once connected to Equiano, it will provide 20 times more bandwidth than any other cable currently serving West Africa, helping Togo attract even more investments and further boosting its vibrant startup culture.\n\n\u201cBroadening the access to high-speed internet is a fundamental part in our national digital development process as we strive towards achieving the objectives set out in our Digital 2025 Strategy,\u201d Cina Lawson, Minister of Digital Economy and Digital Transformation for Togo said.\n\nAccording to an economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo from Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics, it is estimated that the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional USD 351 million during the same period.\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa commented, \u201cThe landing of Equiano affirms Google\u2019s commitment to the African continent, to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation.

The shutdown of Google\u2019s Project Loon brought up questions about the fate of Google\u2019s other internet projects targeted at Africa.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls. To him, it\u2019s not all racism though. \u201cYes, they didn\u2019t want black people to cross through first\u2014that\u2019s no surprise. But I also think there were too many people at those borders; everyone was on edge. They got the worst of it, the ones who tried to leave in that first week; they saw the worst of everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after the invasion, almost all the black students had left Ternopil, and only Fortune and his friends were left. \u201cWhen we went out, people glared at us as if to say, \u2018Why are these ones still here?\u2019 That\u2019s when we knew it was time to leave.\u201d\n\nHe packed a suitcase, left most of his belongings behind, and hightailed it to the Hungarian border where French volunteers were helping African students fill out applications for refugee status and living permits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Fortune is writing the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MBCN) qualifying exams in Nigeria, and then finding a way to get to the UK. \u201cBefore all this,\u201d he says. \u201cI was already applying for visas to leave Ukraine for the UK where my brother is.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s journey is not so certain. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure of what\u2019s going to happen to all of us. They say we can transfer to Hungarian schools, but it\u2019s not certain yet. I\u2019d still prefer to finish in Ukraine, though.\u201d She hopes that the war will end before her 30-day permit is up so that she can return to her apartment in Ukraine where most of her belongings are.\n\nWhen we ask Akam about his next steps, no response comes.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend?

Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka. After Akumah\u2019s exit as CEO, Akinlade Philips took the role. This new exit means Akumah no longer has ties with Farmcrowdy going forward.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nThe Task That Must Be Done.

At this level, the ratio is within Nigeria\u2019s self-imposed limit of 40%, the World Bank/IMF\u2019s recommended limit of 55% for countries within Nigeria\u2019s peer group and 70% for ECOWAS countries.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s curious case of rising debt profile amid worsening poverty\n\nLegality of new borrowings\n\nRising Public Debt level stems from new borrowings to fund recurring budget deficits in the Appropriation Acts over the years. These new borrowings are approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and the National Assembly (NASS) as required by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007 and the Debt Management Act, 2003.\n\nRevenue to GDP ratio 9.0%\n\nNigeria has a double challenge of a low Revenue Base and a huge infrastructure gap. While the government has remained committed to infrastructure development with significant improvements recorded over the years, the country\u2019s revenue to GDP Ratio has remained low at 9.0% compared to comparable countries like Ghana at 12.5%; Kenya at16.6%; Angola at 20.9%; and South Africa at 25.2%. The Ratio is even higher for advanced countries such as the US which has a Ratio of 30.6%. Nigeria\u2019s low revenue base therefore makes the Debt Service to Revenue Ratio unacceptably high.\n\nBudget deficit N6.449 trillion\n\nBudget deficits have arisen from shortfalls in Revenues required to meet the Government\u2019s expenditure. For many years, Nigeria has depended on revenues from crude oil \u2013 a commodity whose price is totally out of the country\u2019s control and prone to volatility. The volatility and challenges with production have oftentimes been responsible for Deficits in the Budget. Budget Deficits in recent years show that the numbers in 2015 and 2022 went up from NGN1.616 trillion to NGN6.449 trillion, while New Borrowings to finance the Deficits ranged between NGN1.457 trillion and NGN5.489 trillion.\n\nProjected incremental borrowing 1 trillion\n\nIn view of the draft Amendment of the 2022 Budget submitted to the National Assembly on account of the suspension of the removal of PMS subsidies, the incremental borrowing is projected at about NGN1 trillion. This would take the total New Borrowing for 2022 to NGN6.154 trillion from NGN5.139 trillion in the subsisting Appropriation Act. The amendment process is still on-going.\n\nDebt management tools: DSA, MTDS\n\nIn managing the risks associated with the Public Debt, the DMO uses World Bank/IMF debt management tools such as the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) and the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS). Also, maturities in the Public Debt Portfolio are well spread out to avoid bunching of maturities and to ease repayments of maturing obligations. Similarly, the Government\u2019s sources of funding are well diversified externally and domestically. Furthermore, in the Domestic Market, the DMO offers a wide range of products such as the FGN Savings Bond, Sovereign Sukuk, Green Bonds and FGN Bonds to grow the investor base, and meet the needs of diverse investors.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s debt to hit N38.68trn in 2021 \u2013 Finance minister\n\nSukuk project-tied financing NGN250 billion\n\nThe DMO has also put in place safeguards or measures to ensure that borrowings are deployed to capital projects, including the introduction of two project-tied products: Sukuk and the Green Bond. Funds raised through these sources can only be used for pre-identified and eligible capital projects. As a demonstration of the DMO\u2019s support to project-tied financing, the volume of Sukuk has increased over the years from the debut issuance in September 2017 of NGN100 billion to another NGN100 billion in 2018; NGN162.557 billion in 2020; and NGN250 billion in 2021. The proceeds of the NGN362.557 billion Sukuk issued between September 2017 and June 2020 have been fully deployed by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to the construction and rehabilitation of economic road projects across Nigeria\u2019s six (6) geopolitical zones. The NGN250 billion Sukuk raised in December 2021 is also for road projects in all the six (6) geopolitical zones, but this time, it includes the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the Ministry of the Niger Delta Affairs. Also, a total of NGN25.69 billion has been raised through Green Bonds since December 2017 when NGN10.69 billion was raised and then NGN15 billion in 2019. These funds have been deployed to eligible projects in agriculture, water, renewable energy and afforestation.\n\nDebt to GDP 22.47% relatively low, poor revenue generation makes it bad\n\nThe DMO has been actively canvassing that the Government should focus on Revenue growth and use of Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements to finance capital projects, for Public Debt to be sustainable. Statistics for 2020 from the World Bank show that the size of Nigeria\u2019s Debt relative to GDP at 22.47% is low when compared to advanced countries like the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom with Debt to GDP Ratios of 133.92%, 117.46% and 104.47% respectively. However, because these countries generate Revenues even with high debt levels, their debt is sustainable. It comes as no surprise therefore, that with Revenue to GDP Ratios of 30.6%, 41.9% and 36.6%, Interest Payments on Debt as a percentage Revenue were only 7.1%, 0.6% and 3.0% respectively.\n\nChina\u2019s loans to Nigeria as of December 2021: $3.6 billion\n\nThere is no official communication from China stating that it is not willing to lend to the Nigerian Government. However, even if China discontinues lending to Nigeria, Nigeria\u2019s sources of funding are well diversified. The contribution of China\u2019s loans of about US$3.6 billion as at December 2021, to Nigeria\u2019s External Debt Stock was only about 10%. Nigeria has other External funding sources like the World Bank Group, African Development Bank (AfDB) Group, African Export-Import Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. These are in addition to bilateral lenders such as Germany and France. The DMO also raises external funds from the issuance of Eurobonds.",

          "title": "Tenants in serviced estates cry out as rising energy cost bites \u2013 Survey",
          "text": "Across Nigeria, the situation is dire for tenants in serviced estates and apartments as rising energy cost has not only squeezed their lean pockets further, but also compelled them to make hard choices in matters of comfort and living standard.\n\nFrom Lagos to Port Harcourt, Abuja to Benin and Abeokuta, tenants experiences are virtually the same of how scarcity of premium motor spirit also called petrol has combined with rising price of diesel to make life and living a mini-hell for Nigerians and their businesses.\n\nRising energy cost in Lagos\n\nIn Lagos, the rise in the price of diesel from N320.00 per litre in mid-January to between N600.00 and N730.00 per litre in March is taking heavy toll on tenants of the many serviced estates where managers have either raised their service charge of adjusted services, especially power supply.\n\nA recent survey by BusinessDay shows that tenants are really not having it easy as 75 percent of those polled who live in serviced estates said services have dropped, especially power supply. They noted that power supply is now supplied according to need or request.\n\nRead also: Energy cost, others, start 2022 on bleak note for manufacturers\n\nFol\u00fa Williams, a serviced estate resident, writing on his Twitter handle, @WilliamsFolu, said, \u201cthey are robbing us; we are paying for darkness. Estimated bills are is the reason they are frustrating metering. We want to pay for what we use for God\u2019s sake,\u201d making veiled reference to epileptic power supply.\n\n\u201cBefore now, we were getting 24 hours power supply. But since the rise in the price of diesel, we are left with the hard choice of getting 24 hours power supply and paying more or reducing the number of hours and paying less,\u201d disclosed a tenant who identified himself simply as Ebubechukwu.\n\nFrank Okosun, CEO, Knight Frank Nigeria, confirmed this development in a telephone interview with BusinessDay, saying that some tenants are already finding alternative sources of power such as inverters and solar power.\n\n\u201cBut these cost millions to acquire and not everybody can afford them. What we are doing now is invoicing tenants differently. We already have diesel account and electricity account which we sum up as consumption account, separate from service charge,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that tenants were now asked to decide how they would like to have power supply.\u201dIf a tenant wants 6-hour power because that is what he can pay for, we supply him that much,\u201d he said.\n\nWale Odufalu, managing director, Apha Mead Development Company (AMDC), a subsidiary of Alpha Mead Group, also confirmed to BusinessDay that the high energy cost is taking toll on their business, saying that they were communicating price changes to the tenants.\n\n\u201cIn our estates, we have different people with different interests. Some people who work from home would like to have 24 hours power supply, unlike those that work in offices or go to their shops and return to the house only in the evening. This latter category of tenants don\u2019t need long hours of power supply,\u201d she said, adding that people get power now as a matter of preference.\n\nIn Port Harcourt\n\nIn Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, there is a slight difference in tenants\u2019 experience. BusinessDay findings show that despite the rising cost of energy in the Garden City, facilities and estate managers have found a way to absorb the cost and shield the tenants from the shock in such a way that they don\u2019t feel the pain directly.\n\n\u201cWe have not been asked to pay any extra money for purchase of diesel by the management of the estate despite the increase in the cost of the product. Again, we still have regular light as before,\u201d a tenant, who lives in Peace Haven Estate in Woji, Port Harcourt, told our reporter.\n\nThe tenant, who did not want his name mentioned, added, \u201cI am aware that prices of fuel and diesel have gone high but to tell you the truth, it\u2019s not affecting us because we still have our regular supply of light. At least, every night, we sleep with light and that\u2019s what they promised me when I was renting this place before.\u201d\n\nAt Cocaine Estate, Aba Road, Port Harcourt and Amadi Gardens, along Abuloma-Peter Odili Road, residents also said they did feel the effects of increased energy cost, as the management of the estates had maintained the normal power supply.\n\n\u201cThis increase in energy cost you\u2019re talking about is not supposed to affect us in this estate because when you\u2019re packing in, they will add the cost of these services to your rent and you pay. They know that once you pay that money, you have paid for all the services \u2013 light, water, security, everything.\n\nRead also: Cooking gas price rising again, retailers lament\n\n\u201cThe management knows that the economy can change, inflation can come and prices of things will be affected. So, I believe they factored these things in their rent charge. That\u2019s why their rent is high. Even though price of diesel is increasing, they cannot come and ask us to pay more money because of that,\u201d the residents reasoned.\n\nRising energy cost in Benin\n\nIn Benin, the Edo State capital, tenants experience is also not as bad as it is for their Lagos counterparts. BusinessDay gathered that service charge and delivery had not changed even though energy cost has gone up.\n\nBut it has not been easy for facilities managers. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy with the management. So many persons normally increase their price when things like these happen but this is not the case here as they are still maintaining the amount,\u201d a tenant at Zuri\u2019s serviced apartment, noted.\n\nTony Alogaga, the manager of Ed\u2019s Luxe Apartments, said though the cost implication of managing the apartments is huge, the service fee has not changed. Alogaga, however, noted that they were studying the situation and if by April, the prices of diesel keep going up, they might review the service fee.\n\n\u201cWe just have to please our customers no matter the present situation. For now, we are still maintaining what we normally give to them which is N80,000; that is, N60,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and N20,000 for caution fee.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to increase and then reduce again. We are keenly looking at the situation and if by April, the prices still go up, then we may just have to sit down and decide our next step,\u201d Alogaga said, disclosing that, on a daily basis, they spent nothing less than 50 litres of diesel which is about N35,000 or more.",

The show equally acts as a reminder of the original sitcom that could compete with today\u2019s entertainment and appeals to the audience that would be interested in watching the series.\n\nWith a stellar cast of Jabari Banks who plays Will and Adrian Holmes who plays Uncle Phill, Olly Sholotan a Nigerian-American actor, and Jimmy Akingbola an award-winning Hollywood actor whose parents were British emigrants from Nigerian take the roles of Carlton and Geoffrey respectfully.\n\nGeoffrey had a change in his character from the bottler to the house manager while Carlton had gone from a nerdy preppy student who viewed his father as his biggest role model and is turned into a drug-dealing egomaniac whose only resemblance to the original character is him fitting in with the rich kids at school.\n\nBusinessDay takes a look into the life and career of Akingbola and Sholotan the Bel-Air actors with Nigerian roots.\n\nJimmy Akingbola\n\nJimmy Akingbola who plays Geoffrey on the reboot was born on April 7, 1978, in London, the United Kingdom to Nigerian parents.His parents split while he was a little boy, and his mother, who was Jimmy\u2019s primary caregiver, became severely ill when he was only two years old.\n\nAkingbola\u2019s mother was forced to place her little son in foster care because she had no family to care for him. Akingbola was raised by his white foster family in the London district of Plaistow for the rest of his childhood.\n\nAfter introducing him to the arts and encouraging him to pursue a career in acting, Akingbola later praised his foster family as \u201camazing.\u201d He went on to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, where he studied acting for three years before graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in the field.\n\nRead also: Ego Boyo: Creating magic with filmmaking\n\nFollowing graduation, Akingbola began acting in productions at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. The young actor learnt to hone his craft while becoming comfortable performing in front of a live audience on the stage.\n\nBy the mid-2000s Akingbola started branching out to television and nabbed recurring roles on the British TV shows \u201cStupid\u201d which aired on BBC from 2004-2006, \u201cThe Crouches\u201d, 2003-05, and \u201cHolbyBlue\u201d from 2007-08.\n\nAkingbola had a recurring role on the comedy series \u201cBallot Monkeys\u201d in 2015, and he continues to obtain TV gigs long into the 2010s. Akingbola, on the other hand, yearned to create a name for himself in the United States after a decade on British television. So, in early 2015, he traveled to the United States for Hollywood\u2019s pilot season with that mindset.\n\nAs luck would have it, Akingbola raked a recurring role on the superhero action series \u201cArrow.\u201d He appeared as Baron Reiter on the fourth season of the show, marking his American TV debut.\n\nThe British-Nigerian actor has won a good number of awards for works on British series like Blue/Orange, Rev, and Holby City.\n\nSome of his awards are TMA Awards Best Supporting Actor 2005, BEFFTA Awards best TV actor, and best Film actor in 2010, Nigerian Entertainment & Lifestyle Awards Best TV actor, and Movie, Video & Screen Awards Best Comedy Performance in TV both in 2012, and many others.\n\nOlly Sholotan\n\nOlamide Olly Sholotan is a Nigerian-American actor and a musician, He was born on April 5, 1998, in Atlanta, Georgia, to well educated parent Bosun Osos and Yemi Sholotan. he spent his childhood in Houston Texas\n\nHe went to Kinder High School in Texas, where he studied visual arts.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Government, as part of efforts at ensuring all property in the state are with building plans, is offering property developers a 2-week window for issuance of free building plan permits.\n\nThe Commissioner for Physical Planning, Urban and Regional Development, Isoken Omo, disclosed this while briefing journalists after the weekly Edo State Executive Council (EXCO) meeting chaired by Governor Godwin Obaseki, at the Government House, in Benin City.\n\nOmo charged property developers to approach the ministry to approve their building plans, noting that the ongoing \u2018Operation show your building plans\u2019 is not to witch hunt anybody but in line with the government\u2019s vision of actualising the state\u2019s 30-year development plan.\n\nShe noted, \u201cThe \u2018Operation show you building plan\u2019 seeks to encourage all land developers and those building to come for their building plan in the ministry. The objective of the exercise is to capture all into the Edo State Master Plan as it\u2019s necessary for development.\n\n\u201cFrom now till 31st of March, those that will approach us and apply for their building approval will not be charged but after then, charges will apply. I appeal to all to take this window of opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of having your plans are huge as your property is recorded and identified as a legal property on Edo soil and the conveyance letter which is like a legal document is issued to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnsure your building is captured at this time as the Ministry is very cooperative and the exercise will continue every Thursday, Friday and Saturday,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nOn his part, The Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Security, Stephen Idehenre said the state will flag off its farming season on Thursday, March 25, 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe State Government will be flagging off the farming season on Thursday, 25th of March 2022. This year\u2019s farming season should be taken seriously as there will be an interface between farmers and off-takers. The government will provide motorbikes for extension workers to get feedback from extension officers.\u201d\n\nIdehenre further disclosed that since the outbreak of the Lassa fever in Edo, the state has recorded 160 cases and 20 deaths, representing a 13 percent death rate in the state.\n\n\u201cThe disease is a pandemic that is still ravaging some communities across local government areas in Edo State.

You should create a political wing among yourself so that it will further gear your participation in politics, it will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for us to act toward our prayers, the emergence of a good leader but we need to partake in political activities. Almighty Allah answers our prayer through our actions so while praying let us act towards it.\n\n\u201cTinubu disclosed that he would visit the council across the state to solicit support to make his presidential ambtion a reality.\n\n\u201cThrough the president of the Supreme Council for Shari\u2019ah in Nigeria, I will visit all states of this nation. I can\u2019t be opportune to see all Muslims in Nigeria but through the Muslim leaders, we can make it happen.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists, the Secretary General of the council, Sheikh Nafiu Baba Ahmed, said the meeting was aimed at setting agenda for scholars\u2019 sermon in the month of Ramadan towards encouraging the masses to actively take part in the political process.\n\n\u201cWe can understand the reason for the disconnect between the people and the political class. The masses are reluctant to participate in the process because of the way the present administration disappointed their expectations.

A. Sule and director PR, Prince Anozie Ugenyi, among others, said Atiku has the most impressive and formidable credentials than anyone else seeking to take over from incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nThe statement said Atiku has an excellent track record of assembling a brilliant team of the best and brightest to generate ideas for how to move Nigeria forward, adding that \u201cthe presidency is a serious business that requires the experience and competence of a man like Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cWe are supporting Atiku Abubakar because of his formidable track record as a former Vice President of Nigeria with more name recognition and national appeal than his political rivals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that we cannot afford to be indifferent to the affairs in Nigeria because our future cannot be isolated from the future of our country. We are worried about the heavy debts, especially Chinese loans that are hanging on Nigeria\u2019s neck like an albatross.\u201d\n\nWhile lamenting the alleged mismanagement of the country by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the statement said: \u201cIt is regrettable that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has reversed the country\u2019s economic and political progress with policies that are crippling the country and making life more miserable for Nigerians, in addition to discouraging foreign investors.\n\n\u201cSince the coming of APC into power, things are getting rapidly worse day after day because the government has run out of ideas of how to grow the economy and attract foreign investors and much-needed jobs.\n\n\u201cSadly, on a daily basis hundreds of Nigerian professionals, including medical doctors, leave the country out of despair and not because they don\u2019t love their own country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe in the Diaspora are watching with consternation how the country is going to the dogs as the economy plummets and unemployment and insecurity get worse. In fact even access to basic food products is almost impossible for the majority of Nigerians. If the happiness of the greatest number of the citizens is the purpose of the government, then can we say in all sincerity that this government has met the aspirations of Nigerians?\n\n\u201cIt is befuddling that waiting for good luck seems to be the mindset of the APC administration. But this cannot be a strategy. This mindset stems from the fact that this administration was not adequately prepared for the task of governance from the beginning.\n\n\u201cEven if we are not going to participate in the election following the failure of the constitution amendment that would have granted Diaspora Nigerians voting rights, we are stakeholders in the affairs of Nigeria because we want to see our country ranked among the best performing democracies in the developing world.\u201d",

I will speak on this issue soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease take note that the police don\u2019t demand allocation of number paper, it\u2019s not necessary since a vehicle has been registered.

The liquid was discovered upon search of his two luggages stuffed with six smaller bags containing 32-makeup mascara, which tested positive to cocaine.\u201d\n\nAnayochukwu, according to Babafemi, claimed he was a businessman dealing in children wares before delving into the illicit drug business, and confessed he met the person who gave him the consignment to deliver in Nigeria for a fee of N2 million at a drinking joint in Brazil.\n\nBabafemi said in other operations across the country, different quantities of various drugs were recovered from suspects.\n\nHe said at least three persons: Tony Samson, Paul Adamu, and Reuben Waziri were arrested in Kaduna on Friday 18th March with 18,380 tablets of Tramadol, and 12,500 tablets of Diazepam and Exol-5 tablets.\n\nIn Anambra, NDLEA operatives on last Thursday intercepted a bus with registration number: AGU 460 ZW, at Obosi bridge heading to Aba, Abia state from Onitsha, and upon search, seven and half jumbo sacks of cannabis weighing 362 kilogrammes were recovered while the driver, Ifeanyi Anyamele admitted to be the owner of the drug exhibits.\n\nThe previous day, last Wednesday, narcotic officers in Ogun state recovered 865.2 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa around Otapele- Obada road in Imeko-Afon local government area.

          "text": "North Korea appeared to have fired a short-range multiple rocket launcher on Sunday, South Korea\u2019s military said, amid heightened military tensions on the peninsula after a spate of larger missile launches by the nuclear-armed North.\n\nWhile they garner much less attention than the massive intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), North Korea has displayed several new types of multiple launch rocket systems in recent years, adding to an already large arsenal of artillery and rockets ideal for potentially striking targets in the South.\n\n\u201cThis morning there was firing in North Korea which is assumed to be multiple rocket launcher shots, and our military was monitoring the related situation and maintaining a readiness posture,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s military fired four shots around 7:20 a.m. (2220 GMT on Saturday) for about an hour toward its west coast from an unidentified location in South Pyongan Province, Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s National Security Council held an emergency vice-ministerial meeting over the launches.\n\nLast year South Korea approved plans to pursue a $2.6-billion artillery interception system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d, designed to protect against North Korea\u2019s arsenal of long-range guns and rockets.\n\nAbout half of South Korea\u2019s 52 million people live in the capital Seoul and the surrounding areas, within range of the neighbour\u2019s long-range guns and multiple rocket launchers.\n\nPyongyang has conducted an unusually high pace of missile launches this year.\n\nSouth Korea and the United States warn that the North could resume test-firing its largest ICBMs for the first time since 2017 amid stalled denuclearisation talks. North Korea also appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite, and new construction has been spotted at its shuttered nuclear test site.",

          "title": "Ukraine Says Russia Bombs Another Shelter in Besieged Mariupol",
          "text": "Ukrainian authorities said Sunday that Russia\u2019s military bombed an art school sheltering some 400 people in the embattled port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine\u2019s president said an unrelenting Russian siege would be remembered for centuries to come.\n\nIt was the second time in less than a week that city officials reported a public building where residents had taken shelter coming under attack. A bomb hit a Mariupol theater with more than 1,300 believed to be inside on Wednesday, local officials said.\n\nThere was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the art school, which The Associated Press could not independently verify. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 had been rescued.\n\nMariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, has been under bombardment for at least three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war in Ukraine. At least 2,300 people have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, and food, water and electricity have run low.\n\n\u201cTo do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. \u201cThe more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into the city, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. The fall of Mariupol would be an important but costly victory for the Russians, whose advance is largely stalled outside other major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europesince World War II.\n\nIn major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions of civilians have raced to underground shelters or fled the country.\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv, at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up. The infants \u2014 some just days old \u2014 are being cared for by nurses who cannot leave the shelter because of constant shelling by Russian troops who are trying to encircle the city.\n\nIn the hard-hit northeastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said Sunday. He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country.\n\nRussian shelling killed at least five civilians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Kharkiv, an eastern city that is Ukraine\u2019s second-largest.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said Russia\u2019s failure to gain control of the skies over Ukraine \u201chas significantly blunted their operational progress,\u201d forcing them to rely on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace.\n\nA rocket attack on the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv early Friday killed as many as 40 marines, a Ukrainian military official told The New York Times, making it one of the deadliest single attacks on Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn a separate strike, the Russian Defense Ministry said a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, a city near Mykolaiv. The Russian military said Saturday that it used a Kinzhal for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine.\n\nRussia has said the Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Saturday that the U.S. couldn\u2019t confirm the use of a hypersonic missile in Ukraine.\n\nKonashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine.\n\nUnexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has said Russia is conducting a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at legitimate targets, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday that \u201cbrutal, savage techniques\u201d targeting civilians had allowed Moscow\u2019s troops to advance.\n\nU.N. bodies have confirmed more than 847 civilian deaths since the war began, though they concede the actual toll is likely much higher. The U.N. says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees.\n\nEstimates of Russian deaths vary widely, but even conservative figuresare in the low thousands. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals \u2014 out of an estimated 20 deployed in Ukraine, suggest an impaired command of the fighting, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia\u2019s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. Gorenburg said.\n\nRussia would need 800,000 troops \u2014 almost equal to its entire active-duty military \u2014 to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.\n\n\u201cUnless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal \u2014 they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation \u2014 there will be just constant guerrilla war,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nUkraine and Russia have held several rounds of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict, but the neighboring countries remain divided over several issues. Zelenskyy has said he is willing to drop Ukraine\u2019s bid to join NATO but wants certain security guarantees from Russia. Moscow is pressing for Ukraine\u2019s complete demilitarization.\n\nEvacuations from Mariupol and other besieged cities proceeded along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors that Ukraine and Russia agreed to on Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, and officials said a total of 6,623 people left Kyiv and other cities.\n\nVereshchuk said planned humanitarian aid for the southern city of Kherson, which Russia seized early in the war, could not be delivered because the trucks were stopped along the way by Russian troops.\n\nMariupol authorities said Sunday that nearly 40,000 people had left the city in the last week, the vast majority in their own vehicles, despite ongoing air and artillery strikes.\n\nThe Mariupol city council claimed Saturday that Russian soldiers had forcibly relocated several thousand city residents, mostly women and children, to Russia. It didn\u2019t say where, and AP could not immediately confirm the claim.\n\nSome Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent. Since the invasion of Ukraine started, police have arrested thousands of antiwar protesters, while government agencies have silenced independent media and cut off access to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIn Ukraine, Zelenskyy on Sunday ordered the activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia to be suspended during the period of martial law. The largest of those parties has 44 out of 450 seats in the country\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cActivities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed,\u201d he said in the address.",

          "text": "Two Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs), Mr. Femi Falana and Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, have faulted the decision of a Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, ordering the deletion of Section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nIn separate statements issued Saturday, the senior lawyers raised pertinent questions about the judgment, noting that the decision of the court was a great error.\n\nThe presiding judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike had on Friday held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand, as it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nAnyadike had, consequently, ordered the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nResponding to the decision of the court on Saturday, Falana argued that the learned trial judge fell into a great error.\n\nFalana, a former President of West African Bar Association (WABA), pointed out that sections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f),137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution relied upon by his lordship required persons employed in the public service of either the federal government or state governments.\n\nSpecifically, the senior advocate said: \u201cEach of the aforesaid sections provides that no person shall be qualified for election into the Senate or House of Reps if: (f) he is a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of any State and has not resigned, withdrawn or retired from such employment 30 days before the date of election.\u201d\n\nFalana argued that by virtue of Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution, political appointees \u201care not included in the list of persons employed in the public service. To that extent, Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the judge would have dismissed the case if his attention had been drawn to the cases of Dada v. Adeyeye (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920) 1 at 19 ASOGWA v. Chukwu (2003) 4 NWLR (Pt. 811) 540 Ojonye V. Onu & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution,\u201d Falana said.\n\nSupporting Falana\u2019s position, Adegboruwa argued that the Electoral Act \u201cis an Act of the National Assembly. How can you nullify an Act without joining the institution that made the Act, so that they can be heard concerning what they did?\n\n\u201cWhen a defendant (federal government) rejoices over a judgment delivered against it as a party, then you know there is a problem in\n\nNigeria. Let the National Assembly, the political parties and NGOs appeal against the judgment as interested parties,\u201d Adegboruwa said.\n\nHe rhetorically asked: \u201cWhy do you want to hold on to your office as a political appointee and at the same time be a candidate in an election? May Nigeria not happen to us in this way?\u201d\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",
