          "text": ".\n\nAkwa Ibom State Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Hon Pastor Umo Eno has denied nursing any ambition to contest the 2023 Governorship election. Eno stated this when accosted by some of his core loyalists on Monday in Uyo, after the Lagos retreat hosted by the State Government for members of the Akwa Ibom State Executive Council in Lagos.\n\nDuring the retreat, Governor Udom Emmanuel asked all members of the State Executive Council having the intention to contest for any elective position in 2023 to show by the lifting of hands. The Governor\u2019s Chief of Staff, Obong Ephraim Inyangeyen raised his hand and told the Governor he is interested in contesting the Eket Senatorial seat, Commissioner for Special Duties, Rt. Hon Okpolupm Etteh also raised his hands and told the Governor he has a House of Representatives ambition, while Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport, Mr Akan Okon raised his hand and told the Exco that he is interested in the Governorship seat.\n\nSurprisingly, Pastor Umo Eno\u2019s hands were down. Even when other shocked members of Exco looked at him, he still could not have the courage to lift his hands. Also, Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Glory Edet who is rumoured to be eyeing the Ini/Ikono federal constituency seat also did not lift up her hands before the Governor.\n\nDefending his decision to have not lifted up his hands, Pastor Umo Eno said he did so because the Governor\u2019s step brother, Mr Gabriel Nkanang had hinted him that such a question will come up during the retreat and warned him not to lift up his hand when asked because those who signify interest for any elective position in 2023 will be asked to resign from the cabinet.\n\n\u201cI belong to the inner cartel of the Governor. Those you lifted their hands are not members of the inner caucus and I know about four Commissioners who are contesting elections in 2023 who did not raise their hands\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen the time is right, in about eight days from now, the Governor will adopt me as his successor having heard from God. I am not the one who wants this election. They are the ones who are saying God has told them I am the anointed one\u201d.\n\n\u201cGloria Edet for example is contesting for House of Representatives but she never raised her hand. This should tell you that I know what I am doing. Even Akan Okon who signified interest for the Governorship was told by His Excellency to continue if he heard from God\u201d, Umo Eno said.\n\nThe Lands and Water Resources Commissioner further explained to his core men that if they study the body language of the Governor, they will see that he winning the ticket is a done deal.\n\n\u201cMy brother, have you seen any of the core MPM leaders follow any other Governorship aspirant apart from me? When last did you see either Enobong Uwah, Monty, Enoidem or Prince Akpabio follow any other person apart from me? Even my private consultations are handled by them\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the Chief of Staff raising his hands should not even come in because the Governor no longer has confidence in him. Ephraim Inyangeyen is only answering Chief of Staff by name but has no power because he is supporting Bassey Albert for Governor against the Governor Emmanuel\u2019s wish\u201d, he said.\n\nUmo Eno said his supporters should not worry over his non-raising of hands as the Governor will during the next Exco meeting this week in Uyo ask those who raised their hands in Lagos to resign and only those the Governor wants to support for 2023 will remain in the exco.\n\n\u201cYou guys don\u2019t know what I know. When the Governor gave me a bulletproof car did he give such to any other Commissioner? It is God that has revealed that I will be Governor and nobody can stop Udom from producing a successor of his choice\u201d, Umo Eno stated and urged his supporters to remain calm and be focused and pray for his victory which he said is divine.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It means we will not have people to run to in the future. I encourage them to join the police and other force.\n\n\u201cMaybe our youths are not encouraged by the behavior of our police hence they are not joining. There is also need to take care of the police welfare and needs.\n\n\u201cIn some places where you see the police, you admire them and want to join because the right thing has been done in taking care of them\u2026\u201d He said.\n\nOgun Governor, Dapo Abiodun, who was represented by AIG Olusola Subair (rtd) said: \u201cWe all need to know that we can only attain prosperity in an ambience of security.\n\n\u201cTo the police, we need to do a lot of homework that will make people to be attracted to the job.\n\n\u201cThe police officer must know that a little effort can go a long way to change the way you are perceived by the public. There has to be an effort to change the narrative.\u201d\n\nAddressing the audience, Chairman, Police Service Commission (PSC), IGP Musiliu Smith (rtd.), assured that some of the issues raised would be looked into, urging that responsible and upright young citizens should be encouraged to apply in order to breach numerical shortfalls and put the country on the right path in effiecient policing.\n\nSmith noted that the police and policing were indispensable to a peaceful and growing country that is determined to change the narrative on the issue of her internal security.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must continuously raise alarm if we notice that some criminal elements in our community are applying to join the police with the recommendation of some community leaders.\n\n\u201cWe must therefore all come together as a community to ensure that only the best are recruited into the Nigeria Police. The PSC has adopted an approach to improving police, citizens relationships through community engagement forums such as this one where issues that affect citizens are addressed.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of providing security and safety is defeated if the police as a security organisation is contaminated with persons who are criminally minded thanks to the poor caliber of those applying for recruitment.\n\n\u201cNo one knows better the character of its citizens than members of the community therefore, citizens are encouraged to kindly urge people of good character to join the force.\n\n\u201cThose applying for intake should take the process seriously by preparing very well for the examination to give them the best possible chance of success.\u201d",

          "text": "Sub-Saharan, national, regional and international reinsurers achieved an average yearly growth in gross written premiums of 9.15 per cent between 2011 and 2020, a report by the Atlas Group, an insurance and reinsurance analyst, has shown.\n\nAccording to the report, the performance comes at a time local currencies are experiencing significant depreciation against the dollar.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Naira and South Africa\u2019s Rand, for example, depreciated by 63.5 per cent and 54.8 per cent over the past decade.\n\nThis premium growth is mainly attributed to non-life insurance. With the exception of South Africa, life insurance is not very developed in many Sub-Saharan countries.\n\nFrom 2011 to last year, this growth dynamic was punctuated by periods of double-digit growth (+19 per cent in 2013, +15 per cent in 2017) and others marked by a sharp decline (-10 per cent in 2015).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe contraction in premiums, observed between 2014 and 2016, was due, among others, to the collapse of oil prices. With the economic recovery from 2016 to 2019, the curve quickly recovered. During this period, premiums grew by an average of 12.8 per cent over four years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, however, plunged the market back into stagnation with reinsurance premiums growing by 0.82 per cent in 2020.\n\nOf note is that Sub-Saharan reinsurers are focused on local risks. They are, therefore, not exposed to losses linked to natural catastrophes. The region\u2019s average loss ratio is, therefore, better than that exhibited by the global reinsurance market. The average loss ratio for 2020, stands at 59.5 per cent for AM Best rated reinsurers in the subcontinent, compared to 76.2 per cent for the top 50 global reinsurers.\n\nIn 2016, this ratio was 53.2 per cent. In the absence of major claims, this nearly six-point deterioration in the loss ratio in four years is accounted for by fierce competition, the erosion of premium rates, rising claims costs with the depreciation of local currencies particularly for reinsurers that operate in dollars and set up their balance sheets in local currency, economic instability and political uncertainty.\n\nAnother factor points to the management expenses that are often high. This increase in administration and business acquisition costs affects the management expense ratio and by extension the combined ratio. Management expenses amounted to 38.4 per cent in 2020 for all reinsurers in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 28.7 per cent for the top 50 reinsurers worldwide.\n\nThe average combined ratio for the region stood at 97.9 per cent in 2020. It fluctuated between 91.2 per cent and 93.2 per cent during 2014-2016 before reaching a peak of 99.2 per cent in 2019.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigerians seem to be at crossroads over the move by the Federal Government to suspend payment of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in August 2021 signed the Petroleum Industry Bill into law, signaling an end to petrol subsidy.\n\nBut in what looks like a dramatic twist, the Senate President, Mr. Ahmed Lawan, had last week during a meeting with Buhari, said the President has not authorised the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nNigerians and stakeholders alike were still dissecting the comments of Lawan when they were confronted with another position of the National Executive Council (NEC) which suggests that the Federal Government may not be in a position to continue with petrol subsidy.\n\nIf the recommendation of the ad-hoc committee of NEC was implemented by the Federal Government, it might increase the price of petrol to N302 per litre in February.\n\nThis position, however contradicts the stance of the Federal Government as put forward by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, that funding of petrol subsidy will continue till June because it has made provisions for it in the budget.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State said the Federal Government was spending about N2 trillion on petroleum subsidy annually.\n\nThe governor said the amount could have been used for other purposes, adding that petrol, which sells for N162-165 per litre in Nigeria, is 100 per cent higher in other countries.\n\nAccording to him, the NEC wondered whether that should be allowed to continue in a situation where, he pointed out, only two-thirds of the states of the federation consume the subsidy.\n\nNasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, said: \u201cAs you are aware, the issue of subsidy has been one matter that NEC has deliberated on for more than a year now.\n\n\u201cThere was an ad-hoc committee, which was set up by NEC headed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State that included members of the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cThe committee worked on recommendations as to what we should do about the cost of PMS locally because as you realise, as has been told us, the cost of PMS in Nigeria today is about N162 per litre, whereas every other country surrounding Nigeria is selling the same product at more than 100 per cent of the cost in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd the country as at last year spent in excess of N2 trillion subsidising petroleum products. That is money that could have gone into building roads, money that could have gone into healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cSo, for NEC, the arguments have been put out: should we continue this regime of spending money we do not have to subsidise the living standards of only mostly those who have vehicles?\n\n\u201cAnd when NEC looked at some of the analysis last year, we then realised that less than 1/3 of the states of this country consume two-thirds of the subsidy.\n\nOn his part, former Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar, has warned against removing fuel subsidy, saying the decision will push more Nigerians into poverty.\n\nAbubakar stated this at the 19th Daily Trust Dialogue in Abuja, last week.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe recommendations were put forward by the NEC ad-hoc committee interfacing with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) on the appropriate pricing of petrol in Nigeria.\n\nCommenting on the development, Abubakar said: \u201cThe expected fuel price increment will push more Nigerians into poverty.\n\nOver 80 million Nigerians are still cut off by poverty. Nigeria faces a food crisis worsened by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Labour Congress(NLC), which has consistently warned against subsidy removal, also last week reiterated its earlier position against the move.\n\nNLC Chairman in Ebonyi State, Mr. Ikechikwu Nwafor, warned that the planned removal of fuel subsidy and subsequent increase in fuel price would affect every facet of life, including transportation, cost of food items, clothing, housing and others.\n\nNwafor stated that it was high time Nigeria fixed its own refineries, adding that Nigeria can end the importation of fuel in the country if it can have the refineries working.\n\n\u201cWe should understand that this is not the right time to increase the pump price when the cost of living is already difficult. Prices of food commodities are already beyond the capacity of civil servants.\n\n\u201cHow will the civil servants, who are the engine of the economy, cope?\n\n\u201cWhat we are telling the Federal Government is to consider the consequences of the increase on the masses and the current economy,\u201d Nwafor said.\n\nHe warned that the increase is going to affect every facet of life, including transportation, high cost of food items, clothing, housing, among others.\n\nHe also stated that the NLC Chapter in Ebonyi State plans to embark on a protest on January 27, urging all Nigerians and Ebonyi state to rise against the removal of oil subsidy and hike on fuel price.\n\n\u201cOf course, the increase is going to affect all citizens and we are saying no to it,\u201d he said.\n\nMeawhile, the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) recently presented three prerequisites that will ensure a rancour-free removal of the fuel subsidy and prevent economic disruption and industrial disharmony in the country. The OPSN comprises Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN); Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA); Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA); Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industries(NASSI) and Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME).\n\nProffering ways to ensure a rancor-free subsidy removal, its Chairman, Taiwo Adeniyi, said: \u201cThe controversy being generated by fuel subsidy is getting to a crescendo and it will be important to guide government and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWhile there are proponents and opponents of the fuel subsidy regime, three things are indisputable: the fuel-subsidy regime seems fraught with corruption, with few petroleum importers benefiting. The subsidy payment is a huge leakage from the revenue portfolio of the nation and there is a need to address it urgently to free up needed funds for development. The resuscitation of the four refineries that millions of dollars had been invested in their Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) or outright sale of the refineries to private investors to enhance their sustainability.\n\n\u201cSpecific relieves to address the anticipated drastic reduction in the citizen\u2019s disposable income and standard of living. It is expected that an increase in fuel price will have a direct and immediate consequence on transportation and costs of foodstuff, amongst others.\n\nThe touted N5,000 monthly stipend to 40 million poorest of the poor will most likely aggravate tempers. A more sustainable, well-thought-out relief should be proposed.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "*Nigeria condemns coup\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe military on Monday announced a take-over of government in Burkina Faso, suspending the Constitution and ousting the country\u2019s democratically elected president hours after mutinous soldiers surrounded his home.\n\nPresident Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9, 64, who had faced growing criticism from civilians and the military alike over his government\u2019s inability to beat back the Islamist insurgents creating havoc in this nation of 21 million people, had led Burkina Faso, a poor, landlocked country in Western Africa, since 2015.\n\nThe country had remained largely peaceful until 2015. But that year, militant groups launched a violent campaign as part of a broader upheaval in the Sahel, the vast stretch of land just south of the Sahara.\n\nThe violence has destabilized large parts of the country and has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people and reported 2,000 deaths just last year alone.\n\nThis upheaved has led to mounting public frustration with Mr. Kabor\u00e9, as solution seemed to be beyond him.\n\nThis perhaps led to the coup d\u2019etat adding to worries over military interregnum into governance in the West African region as in the past year, there has been coups in Guinea, Sudan, Chad and Mali.\n\nAccording to agency report, the coup in Burkina Faso was announced on state television late Monday afternoon by a junior army officer who said the army had seized power in response to the \u201cexasperation of the people.\u201d\n\nBeside him sat Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Damiba, a senior military officer who was introduced to the people of Burkina Faso as their new head of state.\n\nThe military said the nation\u2019s land and air borders would be closed, and a nightly curfew imposed until further notice.\n\nThere was no mention of Mr. Kabor\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts and no indication that he had agreed to step down. \u201cThe authorities have been captured without bloodshed and are being kept in a secure place,\u201d the soldier said.\n\nThe military\u2019s announcement came after a turbulent day in the country. Soldiers had on Sunday seized several military bases and the riot police clashed with civilian protesters. In the evening, shots were heard near the president\u2019s home, lasting into the early hours of Monday, setting off hours of uncertainty amid reports that the military was pressuring the president to resign.\n\nIn the afternoon, a tweet had appeared on President Kabor\u00e9\u2019s account that asked people to stand fast behind their tottering democracy. \u201cOur country is going through a difficult time,\u201d he wrote, urging mutinying soldiers to lay down their arms.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian government has condemned the coup d\u2019etat in Burkina Faso, calling for the immediate release of President Marc Christian Kabore and other members of his government being detained by the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government also demanded for the immediate return to the status quo ante.\n\nA statement on Monday by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Francisca Omayuli read:\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria has received with grave concern, reports of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the Republic of Burkina Faso.\n\n\u201cNigeria strongly condemns the overthrow of the democratically elected government of President Roch Marc Kabore and his detention.\n\n\u201cThis unfortunate development not only subverts the constitutional order of the country, but also seeks to further destabilise the peace efforts in the ECOWAS sub-region.\n\n\u201cThis unconstitutional change of government is unacceptable. Nigeria, therefore, calls for the immediate release of President Marc Christian Kabore and other members of his government being detained, as well as an immediate return to the status quo ante.\u201d\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States is expected to also condemn the military take over as with some other countries which had gone the same way.\n\nSanctions are expected to be announced by the regional body to force the military to quickly hand back power to civilian authorities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But in Nigeria, it was the opposite, as the market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) appreciated remarkably by 11.05 per cent or N2.46 trillion in the first three weeks of trading in 2022.\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation of the NGX opened in 2022 at N22.297 trillion, and closed last Friday at N24.761 trillion, while the NGX All-Share Index (NGX ASI) grew by 7.6 per cent or 3,240.91 basis points to 45,957.35 basis points, from the 42,716.44 basis points it opened this year.\n\nThe NGX ASI last week reached highest level since January 19, 2018, when it hit 45,092.83 basis points.\n\nThe stock market in the first trading week kicked off on a strong note, gaining N1.33 trillion in market capitalisation. In the second trading week, market capitalisation gained N323 billion week-on-week to close at N23.951 trillion from the N23.628 trillion it had opened for trading.\n\nMarket analysts attributed the strong rally in the market to improvement in the economy, boost in liquidity, as well as investors\u2019 renewed interest in the stock market.\n\nNotably, price appreciation in BUA Foods, BUA Cement Plc, Seplat Energy Plc, Airtel Africa Plc, Dangote Cement Plc, among others, sustained gains recorded in the first three weeks of trading on the NGX, as investors took position on companies with strong fundamentals in anticipation of the release of their 2021 audited financial results and dividend pay-out.\n\nBUA Foods was the most appreciated stock on the Exchange, gaining 61 per cent to close at N64.4 per share, from N40 per share it was when it was listed this year. This was followed by Airtel Africa that has so far gained 21 per cent to close at N1, 155.50 per share, higher that the N955 per share it opened for trading.\n\nSimilarly, the stock price of Dangote Cement added nearly 11 per cent to close last week at N284.9 per share, up from the N257 per share it opened in 2022, while Lafarge Africa Plc rose by 6.1 per cent to close at N25.4 per share, up from N23.9 per share.\n\nSeplat was one of leading stocks on the Exchange, gaining 16.2 per cent to N755.1 last week, from N650 per share it opened for trading, just as BUA Cement gained 6.5 per cent to close at N71.4 per share, from N67.05 the market opened this year.\n\nIn the same vein, Zenith Bank\u2019s stock rose by 2.59 per cent to N25.80, up from N25.15, and FBN Holdings gained 5.3 per cent to N12, from N11.40, both lifting the NGX banking index by 3.22 per cent to close last week at 419.14 basis points.\n\nThe NGX Oil & Gas and Industrial Good indices led others, gaining 9.90 per cent and 8.45 per cent, respectively, in year-to-date (YTD) performance, as Consumer Good recorded a decline of 4.21 per cent YTD growth.\n\nIt was investors bargain hunting in BUA Foods, Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, and International Breweries, which drove the weekly gains.\n\nIn early January 2022, BUA Foods was approved by the management of the NGX to list on the Main Board a total of 18 billion units at N40.00 per share and Dangote Cement announced the commencement of the second tranche of its share buyback programme. The cement manufacturing company said it would be repurchasing 170 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each, representing one per cent of the company\u2019s issued shares.\n\nAccording to the company, this includes 40.2 million shares held as treasury shares, following the conclusion of Tranche I of the share buyback programme. It said the transaction would take place at the open market on the NGX, subject to prevailing market conditions and under the current daily trading rules of the Bourse.\n\nHowever, Vice President, Highcap Securities, Mr. David Adnori, noted that increase in macroeconomic activities as well as liquidity following a successful bid in bond market in December boosted the stock market lately.\n\nAccording to Adnori, \u201cTowards the end of 2021, a lot of investors subscribed to the debt market and it was oversubscribed. Some of those funds are now being invested in the stock market, a major reason we are witnessing appreciation in market performance.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have seen activities that have attracted investors into the stock market. The BUA Foods listing, the transactions by Airtel in East Africa, and Dangote Cement share buyback have impacted on the market in the last three weeks.\n\n\u201cOverall, the market is driven by information regarding anticipation towards 2021 full year results and accounts. Investors are investing in stocks with good fundamentals and dividend paying stock on NGX.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer, APT securities & Funds Limited, Mallam Garba Kurfi, attributed the growth to various activities by listed companies on the NGX.\n\nKurfi said, \u201cWe have seen the issue of Dangote Cement share buyback, the BUA Foods listing. We have also seen many investors trying to balance their portfolio and it has contributed to the volume of transactions recorded in the last three months.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital, however stated, \u201cIn the week ahead, we believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting to gain further clarity on the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we expect a \u2018choppy theme\u2019, as cautious trading will likely dominate the market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks, as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, investors have raced out of speculative corners of the US market, as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten financial conditions. It reported that share decline had been particularly extreme in the US, where many of last year\u2019s high-flying tech companies were listed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 7.6 per cent this week, its biggest slide since the coronavirus pandemic rocked US financial markets in March 2020.\n\nThe blue-chip S&P 500 index, the closely followed barometer of the $50 trillion US stock market, shed 5.7 per cent over the past week. More than two-thirds of the companies within the index are now in a technical correction \u2014 or down at least 10 per cent from their record high \u2014 including 149 stocks that declined 20 per cent or more.\n\nThe FTSE All-World index of developed and emerging market shares has fallen 4.2 per cent since last Friday, recording its steepest weekly decline since October 2020.\n\nAmong the hardest hit US stocks was Netflix, which tumbled 22 per cent on Friday after the streaming group warned subscriber growth would slow substantially. The decline shaved about $49bn from its valuation, or roughly the market capitalisation of foods group Kraft Heinz.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Exporters also guilty of under-invoicing\n\n*Action will preserve Nigeria\u2019s scarce forex\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has taken a major step to arrest the age-long practice of over-invoicing which dodgy importers and exporters have over the years used to cart away the nation\u2019s forex with its directive that effective February 1, 2022, all import and export operations would require the submission of an electronic invoice (e-invoice) authenticated by Authorised Dealer Banks (ADBs) on the Nigeria Single Window Price Portal \u2013 Trade Monitoring System (TRMS).\n\nA top central bank official who pleaded to remain anonymous, disclosed this in a chat with THISDAY yesterday, saying it would also help the country preserve forex.\n\nThe source reiterated that the new portal is a globally acceptable price monitoring platform where before a bank would open \u2018Form M\u2019 for a customer who wants to import, the price of the item being imported would be keyed into the portal.\n\nThe apex bank had explained in a circular at the weekend that the introduction of the e-valuator and e-Invoice would replace hard copy final invoice as part of the documentation required for all import and export transactions going forward.\n\nThe circular titled: \u201cGuidelines on the Introduction of E-Evaluator, E-Invoicing for Import and Export in Nigeria,\u201d signed by CBN Director, Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. Ozoemena Nnaji was directed to all authorised dealers and the price. The apex bank pointed out that the new regulation aims to achieve accurate value from import and export items in and out of the country.\n\nBut shedding more light on the new policy, the central bank insider explained: \u201cOver the last several years, the Nigerian economy has suffered from the challenge of over-invoicing by importers and under-invoicing by exporters. Through over-invoicing, unscrupulous importers are able to illegally wire monies out of the country and ship them abroad.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, exporters, because they under-invoice their exports, are also able to take some monies abroad and when this happens, what would come back home would be lower than the actual exports.\n\n\u201cSo, this portal is a globally acceptable price monitoring platform where before a bank can open \u2018Form M\u2019 for a customer who wants to import, the price of the item being imported is keyed into the portal. If that price that is being keyed into the portal is not more than 2.5 per cent above the globally acceptable price, the Form M is approved.\n\n\u201cBut, if the price quoted by the importer is higher than two per cent above the globally acceptable price, the Form M is rejected automatically. It is to save massive forex for the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the source alleged that most importers, whether Nigerians, Indians, Lebanese are involved in the illegal practice, \u201cand so this is a fantastic idea to stop all that nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe CBN circular had stated that the new system would operate on a Global Price Verification Mechanism guided by a benchmark price.\n\nThe benchmark price is the actual spot market price obtainable at the time of consummation of invoicing in that market where the goods are traded. The guideline however, provided exemptions from compliance with the new regulation for all individual invoices with a value of less than $10, 000 (or its equivalent in another currency), except where suppliers have an annual cumulative invoicing value equal to or above $500, 000 (or its equivalent in another currency).\n\nSuch would be required to submit their invoices regardless of the individual value of an invoice.\n\nExemptions were also granted to import and export transactions made by all security agencies in the country.\n\nAccording to the CBN, supplies to diplomatic and consular missions as well as international agencies dependent on the United Nations are further exempted from the regulation, including donations made to foreign governments or international organisations to foundations, charities and recognised humanitarian organisations \u2013 and goods directly supplied by a foreign government.\n\nThe circular added that fees, where relevant, shall be advised from time to time as the system progresses.\n\nEssentially, the guidelines stipulated that an importer/exporter of goods into Nigeria shall ensure that the purchase/sales contract with a foreign supplier/buyer stipulates compliance with the obligations set out in the regulation and that the supplier\u2019s/seller\u2019s invoice must be submitted in electronic format and authenticated by ADB as part of the documentation for payment.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Dangote Oil Refinery to Begin Production before Q3, 2022",
          "text": "*Business mogul\u2019s fortune up $1.3bn this year on cement firm gains\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Ugo Aliogo in Lagos with agency report\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote, said mechanical work on his much-awaited crude oil refinery located at the Lekki Free Zone, in Lagos State, had been completed and the facility would begin to run between August and September this year. Dangote disclosed this at the weekend in Lagos during a facility tour of the oil refinery, the fertiliser plant, and the Dangote Jetty, in the company of President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina.\n\nDangote said full production at the refinery could commence by the end of the year or the beginning of 2023. He lauded the AfDB president, and hinted that its polypropylene plant would yield about a million tonnes, which would bring $1.6 billion in terms of export revenue to the country. He assured his visitor that Dangote Group would continue to do more towards strengthening investment in the country, stating that the company has been meeting its tax obligations.\n\nDangote added that the Dangote Group had revitalised road infrastructure within Apapa and Isolo in Lagos, and also in Ogun and Kaduna, stressing that the group is equally involved in the development of deep seaports and other infrastructural projects across the country.\n\n\u201cHopefully, before the end of the third quarter we should be in the market,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe plant will start with a processing capacity of 540, 000 barrels per day, Dangote said, with full-fledged activities expected by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cFull production can start, maybe, by the end of the year or beginning of 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nThe facility, which will cost an estimated $19 billion to build, has an installed capacity of 650, 000 barrels per day and was earlier scheduled to begin operation by the first half of this year. Its output would be more than enough to meet Nigeria\u2019s fuel demand and turn Africa\u2019s largest crude producer into an exporter of refined crude.\n\nRecently, the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) estimated that beyond Nigeria, the refinery could reduce importation of petroleum products into the continent by as much as 36 per cent, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBesides, APPO stated that the success of the project could incentivise the rise of similar projects across Africa, despite the current focus on energy transition.\n\nSecretary General of the continental body, Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim, had said the refinery would be supplying over 12 per cent of Africa\u2019s demand when operational.\n\nGroup Executive Director, Strategy, Portfolio Development and Capital Projects, Dangote Industries Limited, Devakumar Edwin, said the refinery complex, which includes a refinery, petrochemical plant, a fertiliser plant, and a subsea pipeline project, was the largest single-train refinery in the world. Edwin stated that the 650,000 barrels per day refinery would stimulate economic development in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Edwin, Dangote Petroleum Refinery can meet 100 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s requirement of all liquid products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and aviation jet), and also have surplus of each of these products for export.\n\nHe stated that this would create a market for $11 billion per annum of Nigerian crude and foreign exchange savings/earnings of $9.9 billion.\n\nEdwin stated, \u201cWe have impacted on job creation with 3,580 Nigerian personnel on site, excluding employment by the various contractors and subcontractors at the site.\u201d\n\nHe called on the federal government to harness the potential in the private sector as part of efforts to drive economic growth in the country.\n\nEdwin also explained that continued investment in infrastructure would lower the cost of doing business, noting that consistency and stability of power would drive more growth for business, \u201cand when investors put in a lot of money, that shows that there should be a lot for us to do.\n\n\u201cI think we also have to promote our own successes. We should celebrate our own business successes; we should support them and give them the chances to grow. We should provide them access to build a successful business environment in the country. Not just Dangote alone, but also the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), too, to grow and thrive more in agriculture, agribusiness, digital economy, creative industries, and others that require a lot of support.\u201d\n\nHe said strong support from government would go a long way in boosting business growth in the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the AfDB president described Dangote Refinery and Fertiliser projects as the best industrialised project to happen to Africa. He said the projects would not only positively affect Nigeria\u2019s economic growth and development, but Africa\u2019s as well.\n\nAdesina described Dangote as an enigma, who should be honoured in Africa and even beyond for his passion, vision, and determination to develop and ensure that Africa was transformed.\n\nHe added, \u201cOne of the things I admire the most about Alhaji Dangote is that, he actually believes in Nigeria, and he invests his money in Nigeria. He believes in Africa and invests in Africa.\n\n\u201cNobody could invest the type of billions of dollars that is here, unless the person not only has the vision but also the commitment and passion for his country. We are extremely proud of you and of your commitment to the continent.\n\n\u201cAliko is quite an inspirational and visionary business leader and for anybody to have done what I have seen here, I think that person deserves world class kudos for that. I see a company that I will proudly call Africa\u2019s growth accelerator company. With this project, we see an acceleration of how to reduce imports. We see an acceleration on how to have an outbound on export; a value chain development and how to compete regionally and globally.\n\n\u201cI am completely blown away with what I saw here today. I can\u2019t believe what I saw. This project will reverse the huge sum the nation spends on foreign exchange. When you look at how much we import, it is about $57 billion worth of different products and we export only about $50.4 billion.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to balance that with about $7 billion and talking to them here, they showed us that they can have a domestic market of about $11 billion and that is an incredible market and that will save Nigeria about $9 billion dollars a year from importing petroleum products. This is huge for Nigeria and even for Africa as a continent.\u201d\n\nOn the fertiliser complex, Adesina said, \u201cBeing a man passionate about agriculture, this is a company that is producing three million metric tonnes of urea, which will make Nigeria totally self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNigeria will become net exporter of fertilisers. It will drive productivity growth in Nigeria, prices will come down and the quality will also improve.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, stated that Nigeria\u2019s import of petroleum products using 30 per cent of its forex could be reversed by the successful commencement of operations by the Dangote refinery. Emefiele was speaking during a foreign investors\u2019 meeting held in New York while answering questions raised by foreign investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Dangote, originally a cement tycoon, is worth $20.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bloomberg reported that Dangote saw his fortune grow by $1.3 billion this month alone on the back of steep gains in the share price of his cement company.\n\nDangote Cement Plc, which accounts for about half the entrepreneur\u2019s net worth of $20.4 billion, closed at the highest since 2010 on Friday, having gained 11 per cent in 2022 compared with 7.4 per cent on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), stressed the report.\n\nThe Lagos-based company recently completed a share buyback to boost value.\n\nDangote is one of only 35 billionaires among the richest 100 ranked on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index that have seen their fortunes grow in January. India\u2019s richest person, Gautam Adani, is up the most, up $13 billion to $89.5 billion.\n\nThe Nigerian cement tycoon is set to boost his wealth by completing a $19 billion refinery project scheduled to start operations later this year. The crude processor has enough capacity to meet all the domestic fuel needs of Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, while also boosting exports.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The new year is only a few weeks old, but for many, the optimism for fresh opportunities and goal setting that informed their new year\u2019s resolutions may be starting to disappear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve already gone off track, adopting technology can help ensure you achieve your goals.\n\nHere are seven ways that technology can help you conquer 2022.\n\nStay motivated, ask Assistant\n\nOne way to make sure that you stay on track with your set goals is to stay consistently motivated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing your mobile device or phone, simply ask Google Assistant: \u201cHey Google, how do I stay motivated?\u201d You will get a list of suggestions on how to regularly review your goals, how to find mentors, how to surround yourself with positive people, and how to exercise among other motivational tips.\n\nSet reminders, be punctual\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to be more punctual this year, set reminders so you don\u2019t lose track of time. You can easily create reminders with the help of Google Assistant.\n\nUsing your mobile device or phone, simply say, \u201cHey Google, set a reminder\u201d, or \u201cHey Google, remind me to attend a meeting at 7am.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Assistant will go on to set a reminder and send you a notification when it is close to the time. This way, you can be sure that you will always be on time.\n\nEat healthy, count calories\n\nAre you planning to start your healthy eating journey? You can search for healthy diet recipes for satisfying meals. You can also watch a variety of videos on YouTube to learn how to make healthy foods at home.\n\nAlso, you can check the number of calories in single-ingredient foods by simply asking Google Assistant. For instance, you can say, \u201cOk Google, how many calories are in bananas?\u201d This way, you are conscious about what you eat, whether you are trying to lose weight, gain weight or simply maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nKeep in touch, Meet friends\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic limited social activities like travelling, seeing friends, and going out. Even with the recommendations now to ease Covid-19 travel restrictions, connecting virtually is still the adopted norm to keep in touch with friends. If you vowed to be more sociable this year, you can connect with friends and family using Google Meet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust set up a time to meet and share the link with your friends to join. Using Meet allows you to save time and the hassle of planning actual physical hangouts. Most of all, it is flexible as you can join meetings on the go from your mobile devices, on the Meet app, or Gmail.\n\nLearn something new\n\nIf your goal for 2022 was to increase your knowledge on a subject matter, learn new interesting things or develop a skill, YouTube videos are a treasure trove of knowledge. For instance, you can watch videos that teach you how to play an instrument, cook like a pro, learn video editing 0r photography.\n\nThere are lots of videos on YouTube that can help you take the initiative to learn without the assistance of anyone. If you plan to accelerate your digital skills as well, for your business or career, the Google digital skills for Africa program offers free online training.\n\nFitness goals, workout devices\n\nImprove your workouts by connecting a fitness device to your Android phone. There are a host of devices from fitness watches, to heart rate monitors or foot pods that will pair with thousands of apps available in the Play Store, to help you reach your fitness goals. Throw in a YouTube playlist of your favourite songs, and you\u2019re sure to get your heart rate up in no time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExplore new destinations\n\nWhether you are planning to travel out of the country or just to explore more local destinations this year, Google Maps helps beyond just providing navigation, getting alternate routes, and real-time information about traffic jams. You can also search for exciting places such as restaurants, parks, tourist attractions, cultural sites, beaches, and natural areas that you would like to visit.\n\nFor resolutions to be successful, they should follow the SMART principle and be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timebound bound. Technology provides the tools for you to tackle your goals in the smartest way possible.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Tesla\u2019s African expansion is imminent but is it reasonable to drive one in Lagos?",
          "text": "Every time a picture of an electric vehicle being driven on African soil shows up on social media, a popular recurring sarcastic comment from many Nigerians is that electric cars generally shouldn\u2019t be used on the continent yet.\n\nThis belief was evident in the responses to a recent picture of a Tesla being towed off Lagos\u2019s Third Mainland Bridge. The popular speculation was that the car ran out of power\u2014since, unlike its fossil fuel-powered sibling, it can\u2019t simply be refuelled. Contrary to these speculations, the real cause was a tire blowout.\n\nGranted these remarks hold some merit as many African countries do not have the supporting infrastructure, and very few electric cars are sold in Africa. Tesla, the most renowned electric vehicle (EV) brand globally, sells its vehicles in about 40 countries across 5 continents, except Africa and Antarctica. Other big players in the EV space adopt a similar approach.\n\nBut there are signs this will be changing soon. In November 2020, Hyundai unveiled its first Nigerian electric car named Hyundai Kona. Tesla made its first move on the African continent in October 2021 by installing 4150 kW Supercharging stations at the Tangier Al Houara Hilton Resort and the Onomo Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco. In South Africa, tech company Rubicon recently became the official Tesla partner in the country. The agreement currently only covers the company selling Tesla charging infrastructure.\n\nBased on precedents, establishing charging networks is usually the first step Tesla takes before directly selling cars into a market, setting up showrooms and rolling out service centres. The use of charging stations gives a sense of the general demand for Tesla cars.\n\nTesla, which is currently the market leader, sold almost a million electric cars in 2021. But competition in the EV space is heating up as veteran carmakers, General Motors and Volkswagen, both sold over 200,000 EVs each last year. 118-year-old Ford last year entered the EV race with a rather ambitious target of producing 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023. Rivian\u2014at 9 years\u2014also joined in the race with a market cap of $94 billion, despite having not sold a single car yet.\n\nAnswering the big question\n\nWhile all these moves hint that the expansion of electric car companies to Africa is inevitable, it doesn\u2019t answer the question on many people\u2019s minds: Can electric cars thrive on the African continent?\n\nAlkesh Thavrani, Chief Business Development Officer at fintech startup Bitsika, who owns and drives a Tesla model X around Lagos and neighbouring cities, believes his experience is a testament that electric cars can thrive in Africa.\n\nThavrani\u2019s Tesla Model X, which costs $90,000, was bought in 2019. The addition of shipping and customs fees (about 70% of the value of the car) brought the cost to about $150,000. The car came with a charger (220-volt outlet adapter) and additionally purchased a home wall charger which cost about $500\u2013600.\n\nA front view of the Tesla Model X with one set of doors opened\n\nThavrani drives the Tesla to his office and other functions during the week and typically returns to full charge overnight.\n\n\u201cYou plug it in at night and by morning you have a full battery, just like you do to your phone,\u201d Oluwatobi Ismail, a Nigerian automotive engineer who runs Smile motors which services the Tesla, said.\n\nBreaking down the charging speed and capacity of the different chargers, he explained that the level one, which is the slowest taking from 18\u201340 hours to charge to full capacity when empty, provides about 120 volts. The next is the level two, which provides between 208-240 volts, restoring an empty battery life to full in about 8 hours. The fastest is the level three (supercharger) which handles 400 to 900 volts and charges the battery to full capacity in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe car charging port\n\nThe Tesla wall Connector installed in Thavrani\u2019s house\n\nBattery life and mileage of the car\n\n\u201cAt full charge, the car can go about 500 km,\u201d Ismail said. It\u2019s slightly less if the air conditioner/heater is used. For context, a trip from Lagos to Ibadan is about 125km. This means the Tesla Model X can complete a round trip on one full charge. He points out that there\u2019s also a mobile charger that can be taken around in the car in case plans change.\n\nNigerian roads are notorious for traffic jams, so what happens when the car is stuck in traffic? Fortunately, Tesla cars are equipped with regenerative braking, a feature that uses the excess energy produced by a moving vehicle to charge the batteries, thus slowing down the car. Depending on the speed at which the vehicle moves, it can gain back as high as 80% of the energy generated via regenerative braking.\n\nWhat happens when the battery reaches zero? It\u2019s possible that the car will still drive for a few more kilometers. Different Tesla car owners have reported driving about 16-32km at 0% before their cars come to a final halt\u2014Tesla strongly advises against doing this.\n\nThis is possible because just like your smartphone, battery life percentage is an estimation of how much battery is left based on the rate at which the voltage is discharged\u2014the pressure of voltage output is strong when the battery is full and weaker when it\u2019s low. In addition, there are other factors that influence the estimate, this explains why your phone sometimes lasts longer on 1%.\n\n\u201cTo put things in perspective, driving from Yaba to Ikoyi is less than 15km. Now with all these in place, you have to be reckless to be stranded due to no battery power,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nCost charging and maintenance\n\nThe maximum household rate of power in Lagos is about \u20a632/kWh according to Ikeja distribution company. To estimate how much it costs to charge a Tesla Model X\u2019s battery, we multiply it by the size of the battery: 100 KW. This means the cost of charging the battery fully is \u20a63,200 (~$6). This can take the car for a week or two or even a month depending on your driving habits. For Thavrani, when he\u2019s not travelling long distances, he can go a week or two without needing to charge the car\n\nHow does this stack up against a fossil fuel-powered car?\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re driving a similar fossil fuel-powered car as thirsty as this, you\u2019ll be spending at least \u20a615,000 per week on fuel. The tires will wear out faster because it\u2019ll be heavier than this and your car won\u2019t be as fast as this,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, what Ismail has mostly done is inspection so far. \u201cWe typically just check the air filters, oil, and shock absorbers. We haven\u2019t had to replace anything apart from tires.\u201d\n\nNotably, the car doesn\u2019t come with spare tires, which Babatunde claims is a common trend in many other new cars. The cost of replacing the Tesla\u2019s tire (20-inch rims) is about \u20a6110,000 (~$200) for each tire.\n\nWhen I asked if that wasn\u2019t too expensive, Ismail insisted he thinks it\u2019s fair. He recently bought a tire for \u20a6330,000 (~$600) for an SUV. \u201cThese days I don\u2019t think any tire would cost less than \u20a620,000 (~$36.4) and that\u2019s a cheap brand,\u201d he said.\n\nTobi Ismail driving the Telsa\n\nDealing with accidents and bad roads\n\nAnyone who drives in Lagos knows that it\u2019s nearly impossible to not be hit and scratched by other cars. In the case of Thavrani\u2019s Tesla, most of the incidents have been scratches and dents, which are fixed all at once after they pile up.\n\nMany Lagos roads are notorious for being in bad conditions but Thavrani has found a way to navigate through these bad roads. How? By cleverly adjusting the ride height of the car, a feature that allows the driver to increase or reduce the height of the car from the floor. Bad roads also mean that he\u2019s not able to use the auto-pilot feature except on roads with clearly defined lanes like the Third mainland bridge or Bourdillon, Ikoyi.\n\nAbout a year ago, there was a major incident that affected the car suspension\u2014the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allow relative motion between the two. How easy was that to fix?\n\n\u201cFixing is straightforward but we don\u2019t have Tesla parts in Ladipo market [a popular market for buying vehicle parts in Lagos] so we had to order parts from Tesla US,\u201d Ismail said. The process of ordering could often be a hassle, he added.\n\nCompared to a similar fossil fuel car, Babatunde believes it\u2019s cheaper to maintain a Tesla.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it\u2019s cheaper to maintain. For a car like this that costs about $90,000, we\u2019d change oil at least two times because it\u2019ll have a V8 engine, each time will cost \u20a650,000 (~$90). You\u2019ll change transmission fluid every 2,000km, along the way you\u2019ll have to change the valves and water pump.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that counts in favour of the Tesla is that it has fewer moving parts (about 150 parts) compared to a fossil fuel-powered car which has 30,000 parts if you count all parts down to the nuts and bolts. If you consider large parts such as the engine as one part, it comes down to about 1,800 separate parts.\n\nThe trunk of the Tesla Model X is used as storage space because it doesn\u2019t have an internal combustion engine.\n\n\u201cIn a regular car\u2019s engine you have about 200 moving parts, so if you take this out because it doesn\u2019t exist in a Tesla, that\u2019s 200 less things that can break.

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about four years, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. While still running his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\nChari\u2019s warehouse\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

From the Speaker line-up, which in our Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 words, was \u201cmad!!!\u201d to the different sessions on the next frontier in healthtech, fintech, edtech, and fintech to the massive turnout. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen that many people at an event \u2014 granted, I\u2019m a homebody, but still.\n\nIn this newsletter, I will be doing a quick recap for those who \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 missed it. I\u2019m nice that way.\n\nSome Techpoint Build 2021 nuggets for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the keynote speaker: This year\u2019s keynote speaker for Techpoint Build was Adia Sowho, MTN Nigeria\u2019s CMO. The theme for this event was \u201cThe next frontier\u201d, and while she touched on several things, she said something that caused my data privacy-o-meter to hit the roof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe tend to import philosophies into the products we build in Africa even though we\u2019re behind in many things. For instance, data privacy. Create data that not only supports your decision making but also of those around you.\u201d Something to chew on, I\u2019ll say.\n\nWhat COVID-19 can do does not exist: It\u2019s not what you are thinking; this is a good thing. During Emmanuel Paul\u2019s session with Ifeanyi Duru, VP at Monnify, the evolution of the digital payment sector was on the front burner and how almost every startup has payments integrated now. All thanks to the coronavirus, of course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeanyi Duru, Monnify VP, speaking at Techpoint Build 2021\n\nNot just digital payments, though: In Oluwanifemi\u2019s session with Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, CEO Healthtracka; Ikpeme Neto, CEO Wellahealth; and Abimbola Adebakin, CEO Advantage Health Africa, COVID-19\u2019s role in people\u2019s perception of public health was discussed. Some emphasis was also laid on the importance of private-public collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthetech panel at Techpoint Build 2021. L-R: Oluwanifemi Kolawole, Senior Reporter, Techpoint Africa; Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, CEO, Healthtracka; Ikpeme Neto, CEO, Wellahealth; and Abimbola Adebakin, CEO, Advantage Health Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s still a bit to unpack, but Precious will be doing a more rounded job in the coming week. From Bolu\u2019s talk with Ruth Iselema, CEO Bitmama, to Tayo Aina\u2019s session with Akinnuga Abayomi COO, Tramango to Faiz Bashir, CEO Flexisaf\u2019s overview on edtech, there were a lot of insights and take-homes.\n\nPitchstorm\u2026 and the winner is: Another exciting part of the event was the Pitchstorm competition, showcasing a host of amazing startups riding the next frontier wave. With seven semi-finalists pitching at Techpoint Build 2021, Ghanaian company, WorldTech Consult emerged the winner, carting home $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldTech Consult, Pitchstorm 3.0 winner\n\nBut they weren\u2019t the only winners. To crown Techpoint Build 2021 activities, Techpoint Awards 2021 was held on Sunday, January 23, 2022, recognising some of the startups pushing boundaries in the ecosystem.\n\nNomination-only: Judged by an independent panel, this category saw startups like Paga win the Financial Inclusion Startup of the year, Patricia win Crypto exchange of the year, Thepeer win Newbie of the year, God is Good Logistics win Mobility and Logistics startup of the year, among others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThepeer wins Newbie of the year\n\nEditorial choice: This category was judged by Techpoint\u2019s Editorial team based on nominations from our audience.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s small businesses are locked in a survival battle against a foreign exchange crisis that is forcing them to adapt or die trying.\n\nMicro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) are regarded as the core of the economy, seeing that they provide platforms with which the economy can grow and develop.\n\nThis group of businesses has significantly contributed to economic growth through job creation, revenue generation, economic diversification, etc.\n\nNigeria has 39.6 million Nano, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (NMSMEs), who currently account for 96.9 percent of businesses in the country, provide 87.9 percent of employment and contribute 46.31 percent of the national GDP, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nHowever, their huge number and significant contribution to economic growth do not exempt them from challenges that make them vulnerable to closure and frustration, especially those primarily involved in wholesale and retail trade.\n\nFor the 23.23 million businesses (58.6%) involved in wholesale and retail trade, 33.3 percent of which are micro-enterprises, buying products abroad, receiving them, and eventually selling the products are different stages of business that has their own peculiar and stressful challenge.\n\nMost of them deal in the sale of clothes, household kits, shoes, electronics, among other things, primarily sourcing the products from China, Dubai, the United States, and Europe. Many of these businesses have not been privileged to travel to these places to carry out transactions, however, the use of technology has enabled the almost seamless buying and selling activity.\n\nOne major problem that stresses transactions for these businesses is the payment system which stacks the odds against them. To start with, the Nigerian naira is quite weak against the dollar which predominantly serves as a mutually accepted currency between these countries.\n\nCurrently, it costs N415 to get one dollar from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), while it costs no less than N550 in the parallel market, this unfavourable exchange rate affects them as they are forced to pay more for fewer products. In addition to this, sourcing the dollar currency is another major problem they face as it is not readily available in banks.\n\nBefore the pandemic, small businesses sourced dollars through agents who got the sought-after currency after aggregating different orders as one request tangible enough to receive attention.\n\nIn August 2020, the CBN issued a directive that restricted third parties or middlemen from accessing the FX window through the form M, this further tightened access to FX for SMEs because they do not have the capacity to, and many of them can not connect with the original producers of these things neither do they have the financial ability to purchase thousands of dollars at once.\n\nFollowing a directive from the financial regulator, Nigeria banks pegged the monthly dollar limit between $100 and $200 on the naira MasterCard, which limits the amount business owners can use on their debit cards. Even with the use of a dollar card, there is a limit of about $3000 per month.\n\nHow businesses managed payments\n\nFacing different policies that threatened to stifle business operations, MSMEs devised means to solve the payment system challenges. Most MSMEs when shopping from China, prefer to use the Yuan because it is relatively cheaper and allows a diverse option of suppliers howbeit with different rates.\n\nOguntoyinbo Olayinka, founder, WOW Superstores who deals in clothes and accessories, says she has a currency supplier in China and the USA that helps her pay in their own currency and she refunds them in their naira wallet, a plan she says has served her well since 2019.\n\n\u201cI do not rely on one source of payment to avoid disappointments and I sometimes use Alipay when buying from China, also due to the $100 limit, I have to spread the payment across many accounts or use different cards when other options are not available the naira equivalent is then deducted from my account,\u201d she explains.\n\nAkhuewu Jennifer, who owns Bliss & Bloom Nigeria, states that she buys goods from Turkey, Dubai, and China, depending on the item and type of product, and makes payment however the supplier prefers to be paid.\n\n\u201cI make payments using the Naira debit card, WeChat, and other mobile applications where you can reach agents and suppliers directly, due to the exchange rate before making payment I compare the available rates of different suppliers and go with the most suitable one,\u201d she says.\n\nAsking if she tried using banks to pay directly, she says, \u201cIn 2021, I tried getting $2500 from my bank directly so I can travel with it and sort out payments, it took them almost 10days to even process it and I still did not get it despite presenting different documents, I had to go back to my agents to buy even though it was much more expensive.\u201d\n\nAkhuewu notes that the unfavorable exchange rate is a major problem especially as it changes without prior notice and consequently erodes their profit. Tracking and confirming payment also poses problems as Nigerians are always suspected to be fraudulent which permanently makes suppliers distrust them.\n\n\u201cAfter payment has been made, you have to hope that it is confirmed quickly and that the network does not tamper with the flow of activities especially when you are using an online platform, you may be debited while the other person may not be credited,\u201d she states.\n\nFintech start-ups have also created buffers that help mitigate the stress of paying through its products offerings. For example, Flutterwave\u2019s Barter is a web and mobile app that allows individuals to send and receive money abroad, it also allows users to create unlimited virtual dollar cards for transactions that can be funded with a naira wallet. It can be used on most global payment sites.\n\nDespite finding a way around the payment issues, MSMEs also face other problems confirming payments to suppliers and also tracking the movement of their goods.\n\nShipping cost\n\nAfter successfully paying for products, businesses also have to work around shipping costs, shipping delays, and tracking items.\n\n\u201cSometimes the cost of sending your products is more than the price of items ordered because each item has its own shipping cost calculated in dollars,\u201d Oguntoyinbo says.\n\nShe adds that when the items are sent, receiving them has additional cost except there is a private shipper between both parties which still does not totally eliminate the cost. After shipping cost, she makes the payment for customs duty charges, clearing charges, and other taxes which are calculated according to the value of the items, the size of the items, or the discretion of the officers.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, the shipped items are also not secured and can be damaged or looted by the time the owners receive it,\u201d she says.\n\nShe reveals that there are some Nigerian shipping agents in the US and China who charge all-inclusive air cargo shipping fees and door-to-door delivery services, hence you can avoid meeting with customs officers.\n\nSupplier issues\n\nDue to the fact that most of these businesses cannot travel on there to get products, they easily fall prey to scammers abroad who either abscond with their money leaving no traces or send low-quality products that are different from what was advertised.\n\n\u201cSometimes lower quality of goods are sent to you and the duration of return of goods is exceeded before the goods even arrive, consequently you have to sell your goods lower than the cost price, so as just to break even or even get a portion of your capital back,\u201d Babayemi Oluwatobi, owner, Flotob Empire, says.\n\nShe says most times it is advised that MSMEs opt for referrals, assign a resident over there to confirm the supplier\u2019s details and offers, and simply hope not to fall into the wrong hands.",

          "text": "The failure of the government to formalise the operations of over 34 million informal Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria has continued to minimise the potential of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that, of 39,654,385 total MSMEs in Nigeria, 34,413,420 operate informally, which makes it impossible for the government to regulate and harness full benefits from them, particularly in terms of taxes.\n\nAs contained in the report of the 2020 MSMEs survey jointly conducted by the NBS and Small and MEDIUM Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), the total assets of the MSMEs were valued at N8.41 trillion in 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic induced challenges that affected global business earnings.\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done to formalise this sector, we cannot fully optimise the potential of our economy, and the growth expected cannot be actualised because the informal space is still very huge,\u201d Johnson Chukwu, MD/CEO of Cowry Asset Management Limited, told BusinessDay over the phone.\n\nChukwu is particularly worried that Nigerians, over the years, have become accustomed to a cultural structure of a business, which makes it difficult for businesses to get formalised.\n\nAccording to him, most business structures in Nigeria are patterned based on family lineage, and mentorship, making it almost impossible for them to attract investors.\n\nThe contribution of MSMEs to the Nigerian economy cannot be over-emphasized and therefore regarded as the bedrock of the economy.\n\nIn Nigeria, MSMEs contributed 46.31 percent of the national GDP and also accounted for 6.21 percent of gross exports. Micro Enterprises (MEs) accounted for 96.9 percent of businesses and 87.9 percent of employment.\n\nDespite the epochal contribution of MSMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges that impede the growth and development of the sector abound.\n\n\u201cThere is no concerted effort in place to incorporate the activities of these businesses as well as train people in business. Hence, undermining the potential of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cFor example, most operations in the retail sector are informal, hence lack of adequate financing and skills,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MSMEs survey was undertaken to understand their characteristics and activities and the government hopes to incorporate findings into its programmes, policies, and intervention within the sector.\n\nChukwu believes that offering incentives to small business owners could go a long way in encouraging formalisation of their operations.\n\nHe further harped on the need for the government to intervene in the activities of the small businesses as many are faced with challenges including poor access to finance, poor infrastructure, and technical know-how, among others.\n\nIbrahim Isah, an Abuja-based economic analyst, notes that the informal sector is economically efficient and possesses comparative advantages in relation to similar activities developed in the formal sector.\n\nThe sector also has the capacity to produce positive economic effects as they provide sources of livelihood and economic opportunities that may be unavailable in the formal sector.\n\nHe, therefore, stresses the need for the government to scale down regulatory barriers, and remove unnecessary bureaucracies for the informal workforce.\n\n\u201cAn increasing tax burden and rising state regulatory activities are the major driving forces determining the size and growth of the informal economy.\n\n\u201cEconomic institutions exercise an important influence on whether or not one registers a business because they influence the costs of entry, of doing business, and of exit,\u201d he says.\n\nRead also: FG implements O.5% GDP allocation to promote tech, innovation\n\nThe results of the survey also indicate that despite the marginal increase of 3.7 percent in the sector\u2019s employment when 2017 is compared to 2020, there was a decrease of 3.5 percent in the contribution to GDP.\n\nAlso, the number of business enterprises in 2020 was 39,654,385 as against 41,543,028 reported in 2017, indicating a decrease of 4.5 percent. The report notes the reduction could be a result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, Chijioke Ekechukwu, former director-general of Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, raised the concerns that most MSMEs may close down if formalised.\n\nAccording to him, most of them thrive because their operations are free from the control of the government.\n\n\u201cEvery economy in the world has both the formal and informal sectors, but what is important is for us to have a credible database, which will enable the government to tax them accordingly.\n\n\u201cIf we want to talk about formalizing these businesses, many will be forced to shut down. They raise capital by themselves, struggle to sustain the business by themselves, formalizing their activities will mean the government will have control over them, which may not be to their advantage.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Blessing Asu, owner of \u2018Lady B boutique,\u2019 states that for over five years that she has operated her business, she is yet to see the need to register the business.\n\nShe explains that her initial capital was below N100,000, which was raised through savings and support from families.\n\nShe says, \u201cI like the way I am quietly running my business here without the government coming to disturb me or ask for tax.\n\n\u201cI have been in this business since 2017, I travel to Onitsha and sometimes Lagos to purchase my wares and sell. If I register this business now, I may have to start paying tax from the small money I\u2019m making here. At least, I\u2019m able to pay three staff and generate income for myself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting anything from the government, why should I submit my business to them.\u201d",

This, he said, has to change, and according to him, it\u2019s part of the reason he thought it necessary to come up with an NGO to drive the change.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nRecently, you launched a climate NGO, \u2018Our Tomorrow.\u2019 Tell us about the initiative and what prompted you to set it up?\n\nBasically, I decided to set up the NGO because I was alarmed by the lack of awareness about the dangers of climate change on the continent, and the lack of urgency in tackling the crisis in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. Particularly, I noticed that there is this lack of awareness among the youths about the dangers of climate change. I often use my experience as an example to highlight this lack of awareness. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria in 2001 and would spend the first 15 years of my life in the country. But it\u2019s strange that despite being interested in current affairs, especially given that my father is a Journalist, I never became aware of the environmental crisis which had begun to endanger Lagos until I came to England for my college education in 2017. As I wrote in my letter to African youths some days ago, it was while here in England that I became increasingly aware of the problems of the environment and the challenges they pose, particularly to African countries. So my idea is to create this awareness and to galvanize the youths to begin to demand action from policy makers with regard to tackling the issues that lead to climate change and its effects.\n\nBut specifically, what can we expect from the NGO? What will it be doing in this regard?\n\nSpecifically, Our Tomorrow has three broad agenda: the first is to wake African youths up to the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to their future. The second is to sensitize African leaders, both those in government and those in the corporate environment, to begin to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change. Thirdly, to mobilize resources, both material and human resources, to create sustained awareness of Africans, particularly the youths on the need to be actively involved in this battle to save our environment for future generations.\n\nWhat activities do you have, or pan to drive these objectives?\n\nYes, we will be holding a press conference on Tuesday, January 25th at the University of Lagos to formally announce the NGO. Our website is also live and we will be laying out some of our activities there. We intend to launch the NGO formerly in London in the coming months. But between the time of the press conference and the formal launch in London, I\u2019ll be traveling to different African countries and different states across Nigeria such as Kebbi, Rivers Anambra and so on, to observe the impact of climate change in these environments. Subsequently, I will travel across Africa, to places like Rwanda, Kenya and some other countries to continue to create this awareness about climate crisis. I believe it is important for people to begin to visualise the threat of climate change. I believe that\u2019s the way it will be easier to highlight its seriousness to be able to mobilize action.\n\nBut do you think that in a continent where majority of the people are still concerned about what to eat, many will consider climate change such a big issue to bother about? I mean, why should they care?\n\nWell, I agree with you that the socioeconomic realities of our continent is an issue. But I also think that there is a general misunderstanding about the climate change crisis. It is not a zero-sum game. I mean, people tend to think that they would rather be addressing the problem of hunger and poverty than be concerned about climate change. But in reality, there is a link and I will explain to you how. Climate change is already a huge problem and a big threat to food security and security in general in Africa, and it is likely going to get worse if it is not urgently tackled. Obviously, it is already contributing to food insecurity, population displacement, and it is going to put a lot of stress on water resources. Studies have shown that coastal degradation and erosion are going to be major challenge in West Africa. About 56% of the coastlines in Benin Republic, Ivory Coast, and Senegal are already eroding. You have erosion in many parts of Nigeria, such as the south-east. You can see the encroaching desertification in the north, which has hugely contributed to the security crisis we are witnessing in the region and the food crisis in Nigeria. The farmers versus herders crisis is largely driven by climate change. We are seeing the impact. Farmers are not able to go to the farms, which means that food supply is affected. Prices of food are going up as a result.\n\nSo, climate crisis is going to affect agriculture significantly and when you consider the fact that agriculture is the backbone of the African economy, employing millions of people, you will begin to appreciate the enormity of the problem that presently confront us. So, yes climate change should be the concern of the average African, whether rich or poor because at the end of the day, it is a problem that affects everybody. First of all, food has become more expensive. So, I think everybody should be concerned about what is happening to our climate and indeed it is everybody\u2019s problem and demands that everybody begins to talk about it and begins to demand action from those that have the capacity to make changes.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you have highlighted the threats of climate change here. But it doesn\u2019t seem to matter so much to policy makers on the continent. Have you seen significant action on their part in this regard?\n\nUnfortunately, No. I don\u2019t think policy makers on the continent have done enough, quite frankly. However, increasingly, I think more people are beginning to realise the threat that climate change poses. For example, I saw the president of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari speaking at the recently concluded conference on climate change at Glasgow, Scotland, COP26. He did a good job of highlighting the need for developed countries to step up the effort in tackling climate change. But at the same time, I think African leaders need to increasingly vocalise the danger climate change poses to everyday lives of people on the continent; the dangers it poses to farming and to the stability of the continent in general.\n\nI also think it\u2019s important to also have collaboration among the countries on the continent, because at the end of the day it is a continental problem; it is indeed a global problem. But we can begin to tackle it at the continental level, particularly in sub-saharan Africa. There needs to be collaboration, for instance, among ECOWAS countries, the southern African countries, the Central African states, the East African countries and so on. What is important is that there should be collaborative effort across the board. Individual states taking action on their own may not achieve much results. Better results will be achieved when states come together to take serious steps against, for instance, desertification, by pooling resources together, to consider for instance afforestation. There should also be preventive actions which could be led by the United Nations or the African Union. That\u2019s some of the things that we should be looking at. Africa should work together and collaboratively with other parts of the world to achieve better results.\n\nYou pointed out that Buhari demanded more action from the developed world at COP26. I mean, that\u2019s a sentiment many people share given that these developed countries are mostly responsible for the climate crisis we face?\n\nOf course, this is a sentiment that I also share. The developed world must take the lead in the fight against climate change, simply because they are responsible for most of the global emissions. The developed world must help fund the fight against climate change in the developing world also because we do not have the resources in this part of the world to effectively deal with effects of climate change. And then, when you consider that the issues of climate we face on the continent were brought about by mostly the activities of the advanced economies \u2013 Africa contributes only 5% of global emissions \u2013 it becomes important that the developed world begin to take the lead in terms of funding initiative aimed at tackling climate change.\n\nIndeed, during the recently concluded climate change events held in Glasgow, the climate pact to deliver $100 billion dollars a year to African countries most affected by climate change was finalized. So, to that extent, I think there are gradual steps towards helping developing countries contain the effect of climate change. But I think a lot still needs to be done because of the enormity of the challenge. But as I said earlier, African countries cannot fold their arms and wait for the advanced economics to do everything. There should also be action from the leaders of the continent.\n\nYou are in the UK, and as you pointed out, you became aware about issues of climate there. But I also know that in UK and the rest of the Western world, there is climate denialism. How much of a challenge is it to the quest of tackling climate change?\n\nOf course, climate change denialism is a very serious problem, especially in the West. You know, it is ironic that even though the West is largely responsible for the climate catastrophe that now confront us, they are going to be the least impacted by it, compared to countries in Africa and other developing regions of the world. So, it is easy for some individuals there to deny the impact of climate change, or to deny the existence of climate change, like the past president of the United States. So, what you see is that these people have promoted resentment against some of the initiatives that are being developed to tackle climate change, and even resentment against the idea that developing countries should be helped to fund climate initiatives. It is a very big problem, but thankfully it is also changing gradually. Some of the public figures who were at the forefront of climate change denialism have been voted out of power. In the United States for example, since Joe Biden became president, the country has rejoined the Climate Accord that was first signed in 2015. We have seen encouraging signs that the international community is back on track as a united front against climate change.The denialists are being denied some of the voice that they used to have.\n\nThe quest you have embarked upon is a noble one, but you are a student. This sort of campaign requires resources. Have you thought about that?\n\nYes, but that\u2019s not an issue we are dwelling on. I mean, this is not about the traditional fundraising. I am more interested in developing more innovative approach to the issue of funding. But it\u2019s too early to talk about these things now. We would rather pursue our objectives now. Our concern is to ensure that we get our message across to youths of Africa and to influence policies aimed at tackling the impact of climate change. And of course, in finance once you create a good product, there will always be market for it. So, the issue of funding is secondary. The primary thing is building a critical mass to push the agenda of tackling climate change.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to note that while most of the discussions about climate change have centered on the cost of action against it, experts have continued to warn that cost of inaction is much higher. And we are talking hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the decade, probably much worse. Consider for instance, what Africa would lose if the Sahel region is allowed to cave in to desertification. It would destroy wildlife and the livelihoods of millions. Certainly, the cost of planting trees, etc, to ensure that the region continues to support lives will be little in comparison. These are some of the the things we need to make people, especially policy makers, understand. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea if a fraction of that cost is dedicated to awareness campaigns.\n\nWhat is your message to the youths of Africa who are the focus of your NGO?\n\nFor me, the message is for them; the youths of Africa, to wake up to the reality of climate, change knowing that we are the leaders of tomorrow. We are the inheritors of this continent and must begin to fight to ensure that the continent we inherit from our parents is not one that will be riddled in crisis; one where food insecurity and famine will become the order of the day. We must also remember that we have an obligation to leave this continent a better place for those coming after us. So, we must begin to do something today.\n\nI will say to us that the future of the continent is in their hands and is it is up to us to ensure that today\u2019s leaders take action to ensure that tomorrow we are not left with a landscape that is beset by draught, desertification, erosion, food insecurity, among others. So we should all wake up and take charge of our future and demand action from our present leaders. It is a duty we owe to ourselves and to the generations coming after us and we cannot fail. We cannot afford to betray that duty. For me, it is a struggle of a lifetime; one that I feel very honoured to answer and one that I hope every youth of the continent should be honoured to answer.",

          "title": "Osinbajo appeals to world leaders to fulfill $100b climate change pledge",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo has appealed to the global community to fulfill the $100b pledged to African countries for mitigation of climate change activities\n\nOsinbajo who made the plea in his presentation at the virtual edition of the 2022 World Economic Forum featuring leaders from across the world, urged the international community to \u201cmeet its pledge recently re-affirmed at COP-26 of providing $100 billion annually in climate finance to support climate change efforts in developing countries.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian vice president noted that although Africans are working towards the globally accepted net-zero future, they are also conscious that \u201cour energy needs are increasing with the growth in our economies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him to him, \u201cWe need to ramp up energy access in response to this situation which is why the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies must be just and fair.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that despite the giant strides recorded across Africa, the Continent still has challenges to overcome.\n\nHe stated that we need partnerships that help to tackle climate change, address security concerns, promote economic prosperity, combat disease, and improve governance.\n\nThe 2022 virtual edition of the forum features a mix of visionary \u201cstate of the world\u201d special addresses and ambitious high-level leadership panels focusing on critical collective challenges, among others.\n\nOsinbajo listed some of the progress on the African continent, including the recovery from the global pandemic, economic growth by 3.7 percent last year, and a projected 3.8 percent growth in 2022. He also noted that there is now in place an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to fast-track economic transformation just as the continent is making giant strides in agriculture, manufacturing, and digital technology. He added that in Nigeria for instance, 6 unicorns have emerged in the past six years.\n\nOn the issue of peace and security, the Vice President said \u201cAfrican countries face a serious threat of terrorism arising from the encroachment of global terror groups and their franchises into Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for the international community to make more robust interventions to clear terrorists from Africa just as it did in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The United Nations Security Council must find unanimity in working with and assisting African countries to eradicate the menace of terrorism in the continent once and for all.\u201d\n\nOn the climate change challenge, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cit is now common knowledge that Africa contributes least to climate change but has been most negatively affected by it. We must not allow this worrying situation to be compounded further by global inaction, processes, and rules that make it difficult for Africa to adapt to climate change or indeed to develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are emphatic in our view that natural gas which Africa has in abundance must be accepted as a transition fuel. Moves in the international community especially by development finance institutions to defund gas projects will have severe implications in the medium to long-term for African economies and will slow down the process of phasing out more polluting fuels such as coal, diesel, and heavy fuel oil (HFO),\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to climate finance, the Vice President called for a partnership to tackle poverty, access vaccinations, and achieve debt sustainability.\n\n\u201cEconomic recovery in Africa is contingent on the containment of the pandemic including through wide-spread vaccinations. Right now, less than 10% of African countries have vaccinated 40% of their population.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that due to resource constraints, there will be a relatively slow rollout of vaccinations in Africa and that full national rollouts may take several years.\n\n\u201cThe international community must accordingly support Africa with the resources including vaccine doses that will assist in making vaccinations available to all,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo emphasized.\n\nAnother point made by the VP in his special address is the call on the international community to support African countries overcome fiscal challenges arising from their limited revenues.\n\nAccording to Prof. Osinbajo, \u201cthe creation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights last year was a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to enable African and other developing countries access the SDRs that are not needed or being used by developed or emerging economies.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also urged multilateral organizations to consider the huge obligations placed on African countries and adopt debt relief initiatives such as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments in a manner that will not further constrain the resumption of growth to the continent.\n\nHe called on the international community to support the efforts of West African leaders under the auspices of ECOWAS particularly, their condemnation of the incidences of coup d\u2019etats and unconstitutional changes in government.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "On Monday, Justice Daniel Osiagor of a Federal High Court in Lagos found Joshua Sunday, also known as De General, guilty of cocaine trafficking.\n\nThe defendant, who is also a social media personality, was brought to court alongside Caleb William, a cinematographer, by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency.\n\nIn his decision, Justice Osiagor stated that the amount of material in the case was insignificant, and that he would rather convict and caution the defendants than punish them.\n\nAs a result, the defendants were found guilty and warned to \u201cgo and sin no more.\u201d\n\nBoth defendants, both 22, are accused of trafficking Tramadol and Cannabis Sativa on three counts.\n\nBoth of them agreed to plead guilty to the accusation.\n\nFollowing their pleas, the prosecutor, Jeremiah Aernan, went over the facts of the case with an NDLEA exhibit keeper, Lucky Oghaifu, and presented evidence to the court.\n\nThe defendants were accused of committing the crime on January 12, 2022, according to the complaint.\n\nDe General admitted to owning the drugs seized in his flat, according to the PUNCH.\n\nThey were arrested in the Lekki district of Lagos for illegally trading in 15 g of cannabis and 14 g of tramadol, according to the prosecution.\n\nThe offence, he added, is in violation of Section 11(c) of the NDLEA Act, Cap N30, Laws of the Federation, 2004.\n\nIn response, Defense Counsel Lilian Omotunde encouraged the court to examine alternative options besides condemning the offenders, arguing that they were still in their prime and may be beneficial to society.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian News Agency, the defendants told the court during their interrogation that they had never tasted drugs.\n\nThey testified in court that the narcotics were utilized as props for a comedic routine they were filming at the time of their detention.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The military in Burkina Faso says it has seized power and overthrown President Roch Kabor\u00e9.\n\nThe announcement was made on state television by an army officer, who cited the deteriorating security situation for the military takeover.\n\nMr Kabor\u00e9 had faced growing discontent over his failure to stem an Islamist insurgency.\n\nHis whereabouts are unclear, but the officer said that all those detained were in a secure location.\n\nThe coup comes a day after troops seized barracks, and gunshots were heard in the capital, Ouagadougou.\n\nEarlier, the ruling People\u2019s Movement for Progress (PMP) party said that both Mr Kabor\u00e9 and a government minister had survived an assassination attempt.\n\nOn Sunday, mutinying troops demanded the sacking of military chiefs and more resources to fight militants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda.\n\nThe army statement said Mr Kabor\u00e9 had failed to unite the nation and to deal effectively with the security crisis which \u201cthreatens the very foundations of our nation\u201d.\n\nThe statement was issued in the name of a group not heard of previously, the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration or MPSR, its French acronym.\n\nAlthough read out by another officer, the statement was signed by Lt-Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who is believed to be the coup leader and a senior commander with years of experience fighting the Islamist militants.\n\nThe statement said that parliament and the government had been dissolved, and the constitution suspended, but promised a \u201creturn to constitutional order\u201d within a \u201creasonable time\u201d.\n\nThe military also announced the closure of Burkina Faso\u2019s borders.\n\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the coup and called on the military to \u201censure the protection and the physical integrity\u201d of Mr Kabor\u00e9.\n\nThe African Union and regional bloc, Ecowas, have also condemned the forceful takeover of power, with Ecowas saying it holds the soldiers responsible for the deposed president\u2019s well-being.\n\nEarlier, the news of his detention was received with cheers and celebrations in Ouagadougou, reports the BBC\u2019s senior Africa correspondent Anne Soy.\n\nMr Kabor\u00e9 has not been seen in public since the crisis began, but two posts appeared on his Twitter account before the officer announced he had been toppled.\n\nThe later one called on those who had taken up arms to lay them down \u201cin the higher interest of the nation\u201d. Earlier, Mr Kabor\u00e9 congratulated the national football team on their win in an Africa Cup of Nations match.\n\nIt is unclear who posted the tweets.\n\nSome security sources say the president and other government ministers are being held at the Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana barracks in the capital.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people came out in support of the soldiers and some of them set fire to the ruling party\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe coup comes a week after 11 soldiers were arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow Mr Kabor\u00e9.\n\nBut discontent has been growing in Burkina Faso over the government\u2019s failure to defeat an Islamist insurgency in the country since 2015.\n\nThat escalated in November, when 53 people, mainly members of the security forces, were killed by suspected jihadists. And on Saturday, a banned rally to protest against the government\u2019s perceived failure led to dozens of arrests.\n\nMutinying soldiers made several demands, including: the removal of the army\u2019s chief of staff and the head of the intelligence service; more troops to be deployed to the front line; and better conditions for the wounded and soldiers\u2019 families.\n\nSimilar troubles in neighbouring Mali led to a military coup in May 2021 \u2013 one that was broadly welcomed by the public.\n\nBurkina Faso is now the third West African country to witness a military takeover in recent years. Guinea and Mali have had sanctions imposed on them by Ecowas to press them to return to constitutional order.",

          "text": "The federal government Monday halted its proposed plan on subsidy removal from pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise called petrol July this year.\n\nThe development came as Minister of State for Petroleum Timipre Sylva quoted President Muhamadu Buhari as having declared he had no hand in the planned removal.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan had last week, said President Buhari told him he never ordered any official to remove the subsidy.\n\nHe said they (lawmakers) came under heat from their constituents during the New Year/Christmas recession, pointing out that Nigerians expressed dissatisfaction with the planned removal of the subsidy.\n\nThis position countered that of Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed, who had earlier declared June deadline as end of the fuel subsidy regime in Nigeria.\n\nThe minister said the decision was in line with the dictates of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which emphasises the deregulation of the oil industry.\n\nMinister recounts\n\nBut in a quick U-turn, Minister Ahmed announced Monday that the federal government\u2019s decision to halt the move until further notice.\n\nShe spoke at an emergency meeting with Senate President Lawan in Abuja.\n\nAhmed, however, said the decision would affect the implementation of the PIA.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the meeting convened by Senator Ahmad, the finance minister said the federal government initially had the plans to remove subsidy on petroleum products from July this year, a reason it made adequate provision in the 2022 national budget for subsidy payment till June only.\n\nShe said: \u201cProvision was made in the 2022 budget for subsidy payment from January till June. That suggested that from July, there would be no subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe provision was made sequel to the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act which indicated that all petroleum products would be deregulated. Sequel to the passage of the PIA, we went back to amend the fiscal framework to incorporate the subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cHowever, after the budget was passed, we had consultations with a number of stakeholders and it became clear that the timing was\n\nproblematic.\n\n\u201cWe discovered that practically, there is still heightened inflation and that the removal of subsidy would further worsen the situation and impose more difficulties on the citizenry.\n\n\u201cMr. President (Muhammadu Buhari), does not want to do that. What we are now doing is to continue with the ongoing discussions and consultations in terms of putting in place a number of measures.\n\n\u201cOne of these include the roll out of the refining capacities of the existing refineries and the new ones which would reduce amount of products to be imported into the country.\n\n\u201cWe therefore need to return to the National Assembly to now amend the budget and make additional provision for subsidy from July 22 to whatever period that we agreed was suitable for the commencement of the total removal.\u201d\n\nSenate President\n\nAlso confirming the latest development, Senate President Lawan said: \u201cRecall that last Tuesday I visited the President on the possible removal of subsidy on petroleum products in the country and after my meeting with the President I addressed the press in the Villa.\n\n\u201cAdmittedly, the burden is huge and there is need at one point to do away with subsidy but the president genuinely feels for Nigerians particularly the most vulnerable.\n\n\u201cBecause of this feeling by the president and most of us in this administration believe that the issue of removal of subsidy should be handled with utmost care, especially, that sufficient planning needs to be done.\n\n\u201cSignificant arrangement for absorbing the shock that will come with the removal should be done and the timing is such that the impacts and consequences will not add to hardships.\u201d\n\nHe, however, added that in line with implementation of PIA, subsidy would eventually be removed but not too soon as earlier projected for July this year.\n\nThe lawmaker therefore urged the organised labour unions in the country to shelve their proposed nationwide protests as it was no longer necessary.\n\nThe meeting which was still on as at the time of this report, had in attendance , Minister of State for Petroleum\n\nResources Sylva and Group Managing Director NNPC Limited Mele Kyari, among others.\n\nSylva absolves Buhari\n\nAlso exonerating President Buhari from the planned removal of the subsidy, Sylva said the \u201ccomplete removal is not in our plate at all.\u201d\n\nThe minister made the position known while featuring on Channels Television\u2019s News night programme.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will tell you categorically that at this moment, the complete removal of subsidy is not on our plate at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is not in support of removing subsidy at this time,\u201d Sylva further added.\n\nLike her finance counterpart, he said the federal government needed to tread softly because of the negative impacts subsidy removal would have on Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cOf course, we all know that it is a desirable policy direction. Of course, we know that it will have some impacts on the people and that is why we are trying to work out some of those things.\n\n\u201cUntil those details are worked out properly with (the organised) labour, and with all the stakeholders in the sector, we will not remove the subsidy. At this moment, it is not on our plate, I can tell you that.\n\n\u201cThis is something that needs to be worked out between the federal government and the states because this is a federation issue. We are working with the governors to see how we can continue with this policy direction of subsidising fuel for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\n\u2018FG playing games\u2019\n\nCommenting on the government\u2019s decision to back down, former Secretary General Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU) Owei Lakemfa said the government was merely playing games with Nigerians on fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said \u201cits decision to shelve the announced subsidy withdrawal is a tactical move hoping to lure Nigerians to sleep and then suddenly slapping steep fuel price increases on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has repeated a number of times that fuel subsidy is a fraud, so why shelve, rather than back away from the removal of the fraudulent subsidy?\n\n\u201cIf we are an oil producing country with four refineries and an installed capacity of 445,000 bpd but do not refine a drop, will it be\n\nlogical for government to penalise the citizenry for its gross incompetence?\n\n\u201cIf after seven years of claiming to be a functional government, the Buhari administration cannot add value to the life of Nigerians, then it has no right to continuously devalue it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Director International Press Centre (IPC) Lanre Arogundade said \u201cthey are bowing to pressure but we must remain vigilant.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Director of Programmes Yiaga Africa Cynthia Mbamalu said it is a positive step to see the federal government stepping down its decision on the removal of fuel subsidy especially with the current realities in Nigeria, the level of poverty and the hardship faced by citizens.\n\n\u201cGovernment policy has to, at all-time take into cognizance the demands and realities of the people. While the proposed decision on the removal of fuel subsidy remains an important national decision to be made subsequently, it should be a decision that is implemented with better timing.\n\n\u201cThe decision of a better timing will be determined by several factors some of which include first; the adoption of a more people-centric approach in the decision to removal of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThis will require different levels of citizens and stakeholders\u2019 consultations to ensure the narrative on the removal is clear, accurate and devoid of political mischief.\n\n\u201cSecondly, will be the need for the introduction and implementation of economic policies to cushion the effect of the removal of fuel security, and investing in social security and welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cThirdly will be need to build citizens trust in government driven by a commitment by the government to accountability, especially with respect to fiscal management,\u201d she said.\n\nAPC lauds Buhari\n\nAnd in its reaction, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) described the stoppage of the planned subsidy removal as a welcome development.\n\nIn a statement Monday in Abuja, the party\u2019s national secretary, John James Akpanudoedehe, said the federal government took into consideration the fact that the removal of subsidy at this time would heighten inflation and cause undue hardship on the citizenry.\n\n\u201cProgrammes and policies of government are meant to benefit the people. So if the timing of the planned subsidy removal would cause hardship on citizens, then a review was necessary. We commend President Muhammadu Buhari for\n\nalways putting the welfare and well being of Nigerians first as he has serially displayed in the implementation of programmes and policies of this administration.\n\n\u201cIn line with the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the Federal Government is already putting in place measures, particularly boosting our local refining capacities to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on expensive import of refined petroleum products. This will in due course usher in the eventual and full deregulation of the country\u2019s petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cFinally, the APC commends the cordial and healthy relations between the executive and the 9th National Assembly which has ensured good governance. Nigerians have been the ultimate beneficiaries as displayed in the positive outcomes of the meeting between Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed and the Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the suspension of the planned subsidy removal,\u201d the statement further said.",
          "summary": "The federal government Monday halted its proposed plan on subsidy removal from pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise called petrol July this year.\nSequel to the passage of the PIA, we went back to amend the fiscal framework to incorporate the subsidy removal.\nWhile the proposed decision on the removal of fuel subsidy remains an important national decision to be made subsequently, it should be a decision that is implemented with better timing.\nAPC lauds BuhariAnd in its reaction, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) described the stoppage of the planned subsidy removal as a welcome development.\nSo if the timing of the planned subsidy removal would cause hardship on citizens, then a review was necessary.",

We have recently been furnished by a report that a proprietor of a private school was caught raping a minor, and made a self confession to the effect that he had committed the offence. This time around, Hanifa\u2019s incident came to the fore. No responsible government would continue to pay lip service to this heinous acts.\n\n\u201cWe are going to take a punitive action against any proprietor of a private school who became enmeshed in this despicable act. Government has outrightly taken the decision to revoke the licences of all the private schools operating in the state for sanity to prevail. We are going to establish a high powered committee to thoroughly screen all the private schools we have in the state. We can only give another chance to those we have found to be clean and meet the standard required.\n\n\u201cWith this development, we do not mean that all the private schools in operation should close shops. What we mean here is that we would not continue to allow some questionable proprietors of private schools to hold us to ransome.

This is an example of what we can achieve when we unleash the best of our people \u2013 especially our young \u2013 on the toughest of our challenges, and give them the free-hand to deliver results,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BOI Growth Platform includes interventions schemes such as the renowned Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) loans (MarketMoni, FarmerMoni and TraderMoni) \u2013 regarded as Africa\u2019s largest fully-digitized micro-credit scheme, the MSME Survival Fund under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), the North-East Rehabilitation Fund, the recently launched World Bank $750 million NG-CARES programme, and state-based interventions, among others.\n\nAs the VP stated, \u201cthis demographic was far too important to ignore. We had to start solving for them, especially having been left far behind historically,\u201d a reason he noted led to the implementation of intervention schemes through the BOI\u2019s Growth Platform for MSMEs.\n\n\u201cWhat might also not be obvious is the sheer scale of impact that has been achieved with these programmes, as over four million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises have been direct beneficiaries of the over N150billion deployed in the past five years,\u201d the VP said.\n\nHe added that \u201c57% of these MSMEs are owned by Nigerians below 35 years of age, and close to 60% of the beneficiaries are women. What is even less glaring is that the team of Nigerian professionals behind this work is largely young, with an average age of 28 years old.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the transparency and impact of these microcredit schemes, particularly the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP loans \u2013 MarketMoni, FarmerMoni and TraderMoni) under the SIPs, Prof. Osinbajo recalled his interaction in 2018 with a petty trader, Jafar Abubakar, one of the Tradermoni beneficiaries at Abubakar Gumi Market in Kaduna when he visited to launch the scheme in the State.\n\nHe narrated: \u201cJafar Abubakar, who trades in ginger and garlic was one of 5,000 or so traders who had just received \u20a610,000 to advance his business in that market. What struck me was what he said about how he was selected to get the credit.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018I just applied. I didn\u2019t know anybody. They came here and captured my data last week and I got the alert yesterday.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe VP added that Jafar then \u201cshowed me the alert on his phone. Stories like Jafar\u2019s have become all too familiar to me over these years. It is a consistent tune I hear as I engage thousands of beneficiaries of our intervention programmes.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the TraderMoni scheme, which provides N10,000 interest-free & collateral-free loans to petty traders, mostly with an inventory of less than N5,000, had made a huge positive impact nationwide. This includes enhancing the small businesses of beneficiaries, improving their families and contributing to the informal economy.\n\n\u201cThis is perhaps for me one of the most satisfying things about the way our social intervention schemes are deployed. That there is a platform that can process applications from potential beneficiaries, payout credits or other benefits, maintain auditable records seamlessly. It is those people and infrastructure that make this happen that we are celebrating today,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo noted.\n\nThe VP further highlighted the nationwide impact of the administration\u2019s Social Investment Programmes, which he noted was the \u201cmost ambitious social intervention project in Nigeria\u2019s recent history, with a series of people-centric programmes.\n\n\u201cThis is a journey that only began as an idea six years ago: that we can build systems that will serve everybody fairly and justly and bring credibility to government programmes. One of the biggest barriers we identified was the ability to reach people directly, capture and digitize their information (even if they are illiterate) and process a benefit to them directly in a way that is transparent to all. Our vision set out to solve this.\n\n\u201cFor some programmes, the everyday Nigerians were young graduates who would benefit from a direct stipend and employment placement from the government. For others, it would be pupils for whom a reliable meal per day would make the difference between staying enrolled in school or skipping school to earn money for that meal.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo also praised the infrastructure and transparency behind the BOI Growth Platform schemes.\n\nFor instance, he recalled his visit to the Growth Platform\u2019s Command Centre, which now has \u201c22,000 agents, living across all LGAs in Nigeria and equipped with its proprietary mobile technologies, receive mandates to capture and digitize businesses eligible for its growing suite of programmes.\u201d\n\nHe observed that \u201cevery detail of each business is trackable centrally at the Bank of Industry, down to biodata, geolocation, images and facial IDs of every micro, small and medium entrepreneur where applicable.\n\n\u201cThis has greatly simplified the profiling and decision-making processes that have allowed for direct outreach and impact on Nigerian MSMEs at tremendous scale. And this is being done with entirely home-grown solutions and an ecosystem of institutions, donor partners, service providers and technology companies in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also commended the Managing Director of the Bank of Industry, Mr. Olukayode Pitan; as well as the BOI Growth Platform team led by its Executive Director, BOI, Toyin Adeniji; with Uzoma Nwagba as its Chief Operating Officer.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cthey have brought to bear the best of experience and bold thinking, the depths of innovation and youth, and a detailed understanding of the Nigerian spirit, to build an operation and impact that have become a national pride. The over four million micro, small and medium enterprises impacted till date, and the several more to come, are a direct testament to their hard work.\u201d\n\nAdeniji and Nwagba are the co-authors of the \u201cAid for Productivity\u201d report, which they formally presented at the launch.\n\nThe VP also applauded pioneering partners, particularly the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for providing the much-needed early support to the Bank of Industry to build this operation to the large scale it is now.\n\nIn his remarks, the BOI Managing Director, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, restated the impact of its programmes, noting how programmes such as GEEP have won several local and international awards, including the award at the 2019 African Bankers\u2019 Awards as the most impactful Financial Inclusion program in Africa\n\nThe event also featured closing remarks by representatives of BOI partners: including Mr. Ahmed Rostom, Senior Financial Sector Specialist, World Bank; and the country director, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Dr Jeremie Zoungrana\n\nProf. Osinbajo also commended the commitment of Nigerian financial institutions, technology companies, service providers and programme partners who he said: \u201chave given the best of their expertise to this work over the years.\u201d",

They gave their all and tried very hard to win even when they had numerical disadvantage. It was just not our day.\n\n\u201cI want to thank His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari for his love, support and encouragement to the team while they were in the championship. I also praise the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr Sunday Dare for his interest and attention in the progress of the team. Losing at this stage is painful but we take solace in the great spirit with which the team approached its four matches in Cameroon, out of which it won three.\n\n\u201cThe focus and attention will now shift to the FIFA World Cup qualifying play-off against Ghana in March. We want to assure Nigerians that we will prepare even harder for those two matches to get the job done.\u201d",

          "text": "Retired tennis star Martina Navratilova has blasted a decision by Australian Open organisers to ban T-shirts supporting Chinese player Peng Shuai.\n\nSecurity staff had on Friday asked spectators trying to enter the grounds to remove T-shirts saying \u201cWhere is Peng Shuai?\u201d.\n\nMs Peng disappeared for weeks after accusing a top Chinese official of sexual misconduct in November.\n\nShe has since re-appeared, but many remain concerned about her wellbeing.\n\nTennis Australia, the organising body behind the Australian Open, said Peng Shuai\u2019s safety remained their \u201cprimary concern\u201d, but defended their decision to confiscate the T-shirt and banner in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnder our ticket conditions of entry, we don\u2019t allow clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a tweet, former world female number one tennis player Navratilova called the decision \u201cpathetic.\u201d\n\nFrench tennis player Nicolas Mahut also chimed in on the incident, suggesting that organisers were bowing to pressure from major corporate Chinese sponsors.\n\nChinese premium liquor company Luzhou Laojiao and mattress firm DeRucci are listed as two of the leading partners on Australia Open\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!? What lack of courage! What if you did not have Chinese sponsors?\u201d Mr Mahut tweeted.\n\nAustralia researcher for international rights group Human Rights Watch, Sophie McNeill, called Tennis Australia\u2019s decision \u201cnot cool,\u201d and urged other tennis players in the tournament to bring attention to Peng Shuai.\n\nFriday\u2019s incident also sparked the creation of a Gofundme page that promised to print out more T-shirts after reaching its AUD$10,000 (\u00a35,296; $7,179) goal.\n\nIt is common for international sport events to have policies on what organisers deem as political statements. Wimbledon prohibits \u201cany objects or clothing bearing\u2026 political statements, objectionable or offensive statements\u201d from the tournament grounds.\n\nIn November, Ms Peng posted a 1,600-word note on Chinese social media platform Weibo, accusing former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her to have sex with him.\n\nShe then vanished from the public eye, triggering a wave of global concern among the international tennis community, fans and human rights groups over her whereabouts.\n\nShe resurfaced weeks later, and in her first media interview in December following her reappearance, she denied making any accusations of sexual assault and claimed her social media post had faced \u201ca lot of misunderstandings\u201d.",
