          "text": "The National Association of Nigerian Students on Sunday declared that no political party will hold a convention to select any presidential candidate in Abuja.\n\nNANS President, Sunday Asefon, made this known in a statement made available to our correspondent.\n\nSunday PUNCH had reported that the Peoples Democratic Party picked the Federal Capital Territory for its May Convention to select its presidential candidate amid 15 aspirants from all over the country. The ruling All Progressives Congress is also reported to have considered Abuja for its presidential primary later this month.\n\nHowever, NANS, in its statement, told the political parties to either end the strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities since February 14, 2022, or forget about holding any presidential primary in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe apex students\u2019 union body also expressed anger that those saddled to ensure the smooth running of the education sector including Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; and Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; have picked up the outrageous N100m presidential forms of the ruling APC.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018End ASUU Strike Or Forget Political Activities In Abuja\u2019, the NANS president said, \u201cWe have also in the past weeks seen those saddled with great responsibility in the education sector and those saddled with responsibilities of resolving labour crises declaring interest to contest for the seat of the President come 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised by their effrontery and total disrespect to the Nigerian people for having the courage to even mute the idea of contesting talkless of picking up the 100million naira presidential form while students languish at home because of their collective failures.\n\n\u201cPoliticians have shown no concern to the plight of the students but are only busy in their selfish and inordinate ambitions to become the next President.\n\n\u201cLet me say without mincing words, the two major political parties should forget any political gathering in Abuja who elsewhere except there is a solution to the lingering ASUU strike.\n\n\u201cWe will frustrate all the activities leading to the selection of party candidates if we remain on strike. We also want to advise the government and the politicians who are busy campaigning to be President to either resolve the ASUU crises or give direct orders to the security operative to shoot us at the site during party conventions to select a presidential candidate. If we remain on strike, they should just forget it.\u201d\n\nASUU, on March 14, at the expiration of its four-week warning strike which it declared on Monday, February 14, had extended the industrial action by two months.\n\nThe union led by Professor Emmanuel Osodeke said it made the decision to extend the strike so as to give the Federal Government and its agencies enough time to meet the lingering demands of the union.\n\nThe union had embarked on a nine-month strike in 2020 before it was called off in December of that year.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

You need not be forlorn; the time is ripe to vote out bad governance, and Nigerian workers should lead the way with their voter\u2019s cards at the next polls to ensure the return of better days.\n\n\u201cI praise the resilience and determination of our workers, despite the myriad of man-made challenges confronting them. Nigerians are hardworking and industrious people who can compete with the best in the world given a conducive atmosphere and good work environment: good training, welfare package and enabling laws.\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerian workers to keep hope alive and cultivate a new spirit of patriotism geared towards nation-building and peace.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal and state governments to work harder to bring the Academic Staff Union of Universities and other striking labour unions back to the negotiation table in the interest of the Nigerian youths and the educational system of the country, which is dying gradually due to these incessant labour unrests.\n\n\u201cOur country shall fare very well in the coming years if, as a nation and people, our leaders and citizens imbibe a new spirit and approach in our attitude to managing the workplace, corporate governance and our nation\u2019s wealth.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

From all indications, it is likely going to be an all southern aspirants affair because apart from Governor Yahaya Bello from the North-central, no other aspirant is coming from the core North.\n\n\u201cIt is almost certain that the presidential candidate of the party will not come through the normal conventional method of direct primaries because the party wants to reduce post-primary rancours situation. The worst case scenario will be to use of an indirect mode of primaries.\n\n\u201cHowever, I can tell you that there is palpable anxiety and fear in the minds of the aspirants because they have all concluded that President Buhari will determine who flies the flag of the party. Uppermost in the minds of the aspirants is that the president will still adopt the measure he used during our national convention in anointing the presidential candidate of the party,\u201d the chieftain said.\n\nEqually reacting to the situation, a member of the support group of one of the aspirants, who spoke to Sunday Sun in confidence, also confirmed the fears in the camps of the aspirants.\n\nHe also admitted that many of the aspirants have perfected plans to decamp to other political parties, stressing; \u201cI can tell you that the fear of the unknown has driven many of the presidential aspirants to explore plan B option with other political parties that can give them ticket to contest.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, none of the presidential aspirants is very sure of getting the ticket of the party for now. The president is not also helping matters. This aspirant will inform him of his intention, he will not discourage him, but rather encourage him to go ahead.\n\n\u201cHe did the same thing to the national chairmanship aspirants during the national convention. In fact, one of them even allegedly visited him in London at the height of the speculation that he endorsed Abdullahi Adamu, but he told the aspirant to go on with his campaigns, only to return and confirm his endorsement of Adamu.\u201d",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021.

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate. Since its launch, Eden Life has provided over 150,000 services in Nigeria.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Prosper Otemuyiwa, and Silm Momoh co-founded the company in Nigeria in 2019. It connects busy professionals with concierge services, and a subscription service that delivers high-quality chef-prepared meals, laundry services, and house cleaning.\n\nComing in with a twist: Unlike Lagos, Nairobi users get an additional service: a beauty and wellness service.\n\nWhat you should know about Lynk: The platform was launched in 2015, and it facilitated over 150,000 jobs, transferring $4.5 million to over 2,000 workers across four major verticals: beauty & wellness, cleaning & care, installation, repair & maintenance, and furniture & decor.\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePort 365, an African digital freight forwarding company, has raised $5 million in seed funding to drive end-to-end digitisation of freight management in Africa and support its expansion into new markets.\n\nLed by Mobility 54 \u2014 VC arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group \u2014 SBI Investment, Flexport, ODX, a Singaporean syndicate fund, Samurai Incubate, and other angel investors participated.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do? Launched in 2019 by Hio Sola-Usidame (CEO), the platform covers air freight, ocean freight, inland haulage (trucking, barge, and rail), and Pay-As-You-Go warehousing, marine insurance, customs brokerage, and more.\n\nCurrently, OnePort 365 is creating an operating system for African cross-border trade, assisting traders in managing their freight processes via a digital platform that enables seamless freight forwarding and other value-added services.\n\nAccording to OnePort 365, traders no longer have to wait up to two weeks to compare the best rates from various service providers. They can explore competitive offers on the platform and book freights in 30 seconds or less using pre-negotiated rates.\n\nIt currently operates in Nigeria and Ghana, and is exploring other markets. The platform also makes use of advancements in payment technology and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to enable instant payments.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve efficiency and lower overheads in cross-border trading across the continent, and to launch several new services that will boost overall profitability.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion.

But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain awareness and user education is a background check that must be done to foster blockchain adoption. Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey?

They are the people who understand the terrain; you have to rely on them for quality intelligence.\n\n\u201cYou just came into the state; no matter how fast you have learned, you can\u2019t claim to know the terrain better than those who are born here. For you to be able to work with them, that mutual respect must be there.\n\n\u201cThat trust that you have come to support them must be quickly built, and any sense of rivalry will not come. We enjoy good working relationships with other security agencies, including the police, and Department of State Services (DSS) and the NSCDC and we will like that to continue.\u201d\n\nHe further noted, \u201cWhen you are posted to work in Edo, your first responsibility is to Edo people and you then report back and say that this is what is happening in Edo. You have an agro ranger and they have to understand what we are doing to secure our forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure effective protection of lives and property in the state. We shall make efforts to protect individuals, organizations, businesses, groups and communities against any form of threat,\u201d Obaseki assured.\n\nEarlier, the new Edo NSCDC Commandant assured the governor that he would cooperate and relate with other security agencies as well as stakeholders to improve security in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWithout this collaboration, we may not succeed, and we know that this cooperation begins with meaningful partnership with the government and other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We saw them; some people even tried to make videos, but everyone was afraid not to be spotted and shot,\u201d the source added.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, said, \u201cGenerally speaking, any attack on any security agent is a threat to the soul of a nation. Yes, there was a shooting incident at a checkpoint in Agulu but the information is still sketchy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, it was learnt that the attack at the restaurant, also known as \u1ee4t\u1ecd Nd\u1ee5 beer parlour, occurred on Friday when some gunmen invaded it at about 8pm and immediately opened fire, killing its owner, identified as \u1ee4t\u1ecd Nd\u1ee5, and her four customers.\n\nVideos from the scene of the incident that trended on social media also showed four male victims and Nd\u1ee5 lying lifeless in a pool of blood.\n\nSympathisers were also seen mourning as the corpses were taken to a mortuary in an ambulance.\n\nThe police spokesperson, who said an enquiry about the attack was ongoing and promised to get back to our correspondent, had yet to do so as of the time of filing the report, according to Punch.",

          "text": "Weekly Recap by News Agency of Nigeria\n\nThe previous week had the internet buzzing following different news reports from the local and international space.\n\nThe week kicked off with arguments and discussions on how the body of the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi was supposed to be handled according to tradition after his death.\n\nWhile some argued that his religion should overshadow his tradition, some others blamed social media and civilisation for the exposure of the traditional ruler\u2019s body, which reports say tradition forbids.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) while keeping tab of weekly trends, reports that the news on the late Alaafin was subsequently overshadowed on social media when the daughter of Iyabo Ojo, a Nollywood actress posted on social media the picture of her newly acquired car on April 24.\n\nPriscilla, a 21-year-old social influencer, shared pictures of her new car on her official Instagram page with the caption, \u201cNew Whip\u201d, as fans gushed.\n\nNot long after she shared the good news online, numerous fans and celebrities congratulated her.\n\nOn Monday, the Twitter Board of Directors, agreed to a 44 billion dollar takeover offer by Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, potentially making it one of the biggest deals to turn a company private.\n\nTwitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as \u201ctweets\u201d.\n\nMusk, who made the shock bid less than two weeks ago, said Twitter had \u201ctremendous potential\u201d that he would unlock.\n\nHe also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.\n\nThe firm initially rebuffed Musk\u2019s bid but said it would now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, popular Nigerian singer, J\u2019odie, whose real name is Joy Odiete, shocked Nigerians when she sought help for her child with special needs through her official Instagram page @jodiegreat.\n\nThe single mother said she had been drained financially and emotionally while taking care of the six-year-old boy.\n\n\u201cWho knows? Maybe the essence of Kuchi Kuchi was not for my popularity, but to respond to the silent cries of mothers who gave birth to special needs children.\n\n\u201cMaybe its essence was to speak for the blood of the special needs children that has been spilled IN SECRET by helpless mothers who did not know what else to do.\n\n\u201cI know this, because some strangers have advised me to kill or abandon my son, because such children are sent to swallow up finances,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNAN reports that J\u2019odie found fame after participating in the 2006 West African Idols reality show and her popular single \u2018Kuchi Kuchi\u2019, was a household song in 2010.\n\nNollywood actor, producer and director, Yul Edochie, on Wednesday kept the internet buzzing and generated lots of reactions after he shared the picture of his son with his second wife, Judy Austin, a Nollywood actress, on his Instagram page.\n\nSharing the boy\u2019s picture, he wrote, \u201cHis name is STAR DIKE MUNACHIMSO YUL-EDOCHIE. Born by my second wife, Judy Austin. And I love him so much, just as much as I love my other children.\u201d\n\nThis caused a stir among his fans and Nigerians who acted as online in-laws.\n\nYul\u2019s wife, May Edochie, to whom he had been married to for 17 years with four kids also reacted to the actor\u2019s revelation, when she wrote, \u201cMay God judge you both.\u201d\n\nThere were several comments from Nigerians and family members especially from, Yul\u2019s father, veteran Nollywood actor, Pete Edochie, who allegedly said he only recognised the first wife according to tradition.\n\nYul Edochie, subsequently hailed his first wife, May, via an Instagram post where he shared her picture, saying she was his \u201cundisputed number one.\u201d\n\nHis revelation generated so many controversies and arguments for and against polygamy and polyandry.\n\nWhile some said Yul wouldn\u2019t have been castigated if he was a billionaire, some said the accusations would have been worse if he was a female.\n\nThe actor later expressed shock at how Nigerians were quick to respond to his revelation of a second wife compared to his acting and political career.\n\nNigerian broadcaster, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, however, said, \u201cIn my humble opinion, it would be in perfect equilibrium, if May Edochie married a second husband, had a child for him, and then posted Yul\u2019s pic with the comment below: @yuledochie, number one undisputed! sadly, life in Nigeria offers women very poor options.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Thursday took a new turn as reports that some ladies allegedly engaged in the act of having sexual intercourse with dogs filled the air.\n\nIt was alleged that some ladies living in a particular area in Lagos were offered N1.5 million for dogs to have sexual intercourse with them.\n\nVideos of women in the act began to go viral. While some people commented that the act was not new, some others warned that people should be careful when choosing a partner.\n\nNAN, however, observed that most of the videos that went viral were copied from adult internet sites posted two years ago.\n\nA Nigerian lady (name witheld) later became the talk of the town when she claimed to be the lady having sexual intercourse with a dog.\n\nShe later shared a video on her Instagram page where she said it was not true she slept with a dog but only \u201ccatching cruise.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, her boyfriend left her when he heard the news.\n\nOn Friday, internet and social media was agog following the performance of Nigerian singer and Grammy award winner, Damini Ogulu popularly known as Burna Boy, with his historic sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden (MSG) in New York.\n\nNAN gathered that it was the first sold-out show by a Nigerian at the iconic 20,000 capacity venue\n\nCommending his performance, Nigerian artiste, Ric Hassani, said, \u201cI hope everyone has seen Burna\u2019s MSG performance and I hope that becomes the standard, no more nonsense and mimings and yellings on stage please.

When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\u201cOther success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, Nigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts back to their countries of origin.\n\nThe Oba of Benin informed the President that his Royal Court has concluded plans with the NCMM to establish an ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum to house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure Mr President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin bronzes and artefacts not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria,\u201d he said",

          "text": "\u2026Gross profit hits N48.8bn, rising by 122.3%\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and the London Stock Exchange, announces its unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7bn from N10.6bn year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4bn from N1.7bn year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6bn from N57.9bn year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8bn from N20.1bn year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nIn its operations, Seplat Energy demonstrated a strong safety record, which extended to 26.1 million hours without LTI from operated assets (2.0 million hours in Q1 2022).\n\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis. The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\n\n\u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote has said on Wednesday that women entrepreneurs in the Nigerian oil and gas industry should break barriers by taking advantage of the $40m fund created specifically for them under the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund, NCI Fund.\n\nWabote spoke at the annual general meeting of the Oil and Gas Trainers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, OGTAN, held in Abuja with the theme \u201cDiversity & Inclusiveness in Human Capital development for the Energy Sector.\u201d\n\nNoting that that unavailability of funds was one of the key challenges that often hinder the participation of women in the oil and gas activities, the Executive Secretary stated that the Board had addressed the issue through the NCI Fund.\n\n\u201cTo provide a fair chance for women in the oil and gas industry, the Board partnered with the NEXIM Bank to establish a $20 million fund that was matched with an additional $20 million fund by NEXIM bank, making the total pool of funds available to women in oil and gas to be $40 million,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the Board and its partners have introduced and implemented several initiatives that promote diversity in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSome of those gender-focused interventions were being implemented in partnership with the Bank of Industry, BoI, while others were facilitated by the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, he added.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary, another step taken by the Board to drive diversity in oil and gas activities was the setting up of the Diversity Sectorial Group in the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Board has also organized events that were targeted at women and community activities to promote inclusiveness.\n\nHe mentioned that NCDMB\u2019s efforts to lead the womenfolk into the mainstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry was recognized at the 5th Nigerian International Energy Summit this year when the agency was bestowed with an award of the \u201cBest Gender Support Company in the Energy Space\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Human Capacity Development, the NCDMB boss explained that it adds significant value to the energy sector, and contributes to developing local content in the energy sector.\n\nHe also confirmed that the Board\u2019s Human Capacity Development model has no gender bias as it was inclusive and provides equal opportunities to all applicants and beneficiaries.\n\nHe hinted that NCDMB had put in place the 60-20-20 training model in which 60 percent of the training resources provided by the Board and the industry are devoted to providing young Nigerians with specialized skills they need to secure employment.\n\nHe stated that \u201cunder this component of the model, beneficiaries are provided with qualitative skills and international certifications that will position them for employment within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that 20 percent of the training spend was geared towards improvement in the productivity of already employed personnel while another 20 percent of spend on training is used for trainings on soft skills.\n\nThe Executive Secretary assured that the Board will continue to develop female members of staff to occupy key positions in preparation for higher leadership roles as well as continue to promote Human Capacity Development across various spheres of the energy sector, including skill development and entrepreneurship programs and STEM development across secondary and tertiary institutions to prepare youths for the future.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja in Appeal No. CA/ABJ/CV/269/2022 in the case between the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) vs Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim has ruled that all proceedings including the contempt proceedings initiated by Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and co at the trial court should be stayed pending the hearing, and determination of the substantive appeal.\n\nThe application for stay was argued on behalf of AMCON by their defence counsel A.U. Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings order, which he obtained under questionable circumstances.\n\nRecall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation owe the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried all reasonable and peaceful resolution strategies to recover the debt from Jimoh Ibrahim to no avail.\n\nAs a responsible debt recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, AMCON approached the Federal High Court (FHC) in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 to seek justice, and accordingly received an order of the trial court to take over the businesses of Jimoh Ibrahim. AMCON further received the backing of the trial court to appoint a Receiver/Manager to oversee the businesses on behalf of AMCON.\n\nFollowing the trial court\u2019s ruling, Jimoh Ibrahim, claimed that he was directed by the court on March 9, 2022, to commence contempt proceedings against the Executive Management of AMCON, which led AMCON to challenge the said ruling by filling Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeal on March 14, 2022.\n\nThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the outstanding N69.4billion debt owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.",

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nNigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has commenced the process of conducting a study to assess the current level of competition in the colocation and infrastructure sharing, CIS, segment of the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\nAccording to NCC, seventy-eight licensees are currently operating in that market segment.\n\nThe study is to enable the Commission to have insightful and evidenced-based facts to glean the dynamics at play and ensure the continuous growth of the CIS segment of the telecom market.\n\nThe NCC takes this issue as priority in view of the critical role played by the colocation and infrastructure sharing segment of the telecom ecosystem in ensuring robust services.\n\nAlready, the Commission has engaged the services of Messrs. Price Waterhouse Cooper, PwC, one of the world\u2019s reputable consulting firms, to conduct the study on its behalf, in exercise of NCC\u2019s regulatory functions as provided in the Nigerian Communications Act, NCA, 2003. The study is expected to be concluded between April and July, 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the NCC\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 forum recently organised in Lagos on the commencement of the study, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economy Analysis, PCEA, at NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, who represented the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the forum was hosted to intimate operators in the CIS segment of the telecom market on the study and to secure their buy-in and cooperation with the consultants undertaking the study.\n\nAkinloye reasoned that, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services, the NCC periodically conducts studies to assess the level of competition in the industry.\n\n\u201cHaving successfully conducted competition assessment studies in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the Commission had issued determinations based on the findings of the studies while outcome of such studies has also enabled the Commission to come up with various regulatory interventions and initiatives to continuously provide a level-playing field for the interplay of market forces. These procedures are emplaced by the Commission to ensure fair, efficient and sustainable competition in the Nigerian telecom industry.\u201d\n\nDespite the measurable progress made by the Commission, Akinloye stated that, since the successful completion of the 2013 study, there had been significant development and activities in some market segments of the industry that had necessitated the conduct of another competition study.\n\nFor instance, at the time the 2013 study was conducted, the CIS market segment was still at embryonic stage and as such, much emphasis was not placed on it. However, \u201cThe CIS segment has recorded significant growth and transformation over the years having about 80 licensees, operating in the segment while its performance and activities continue to impact significantly on other segments of the Nigerian industry. The Director PCEA also informed that activities in the CIS market have also attained the targets set out in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025)\u201d.\n\nAkinloye further declared that the overarching objective of the study is to provide current insights into the level of competition in the CIS market segment and articulate strategies to enhance opportunities in the market, as well as ensure the deepening of competition which will ultimately support the provision of innovative services for the benefits of both market players and the consumers at large.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with NCC\u2019s participatory approach to regulation, this initial stakeholders forum has been convened to formally introduce the project and the appointed consultants to the industry\u201d. Akinloye informed participants and asserted that the forum provides opportunities for stakeholders to gain an understanding into the objective, scope and methodology of the study, as well as to ensure that questionnaire or Request for Information (RFI) developed by the consultants to access the level of competition in the market are well understood.\n\nThus, Akinloye rallied the stakeholders to see the forum as an opportunity \u201cto seek and receive clarification based on presentation delivered by the consultant and to make comments on issues relating to the study. She urged all participants to \u201ccommit to the objectives of the study, by providing complete, timely feedback to questionnaires.\u201d\n\nDirector, Technical Standards and Network Integrity at NCC, Bako Wakil, also joined Akinloye in seeking the full cooperation of licensees in the CIS segment of the telecom market whenever they are approached by the consultants for relevant information either through the instrumentality of the RFI or through one-on-one sessions with consultants in the course of the implementation of the study.\n\nAccording to Wakil, the study is in the interest of the CIS licensees, other players and the consumers. It will also provide the Commission with useful and evidenced-based insights necessary to ensure healthy competition and a level-playing ground in the CIS segment and ensure sustainability in the growth of the telecommunication industry.\n\n\u201cAlso, rest assured of the confidentiality of any information provided to the Commission in the course of this study, no matter how sensitive,\u201d Bako said to the enthusiastic audience.\n\nEarlier in her presentation to telecom stakeholders at the event, Partner at PwC, Mary Iwelumo, amplified the voice of the Commission on the objectives of the study and urged them to cooperate with the firm in providing accurate, timely and adequate responses to the RFI or the questionnaire that would be administered. This will ensure that appropriate information are to obtained to address the challenges in the sector.",

Today, April 30, 2022 is all about Nigerian youths. We are supporting Yahaya Bello for this and no one else. That he has the capacity to solve the problem of insecurity and a host of others facing the nation is not in doubt.\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of the country. We must give youths a chance, especially one that has demonstrated uncommon capacity, in the person of Yahaya Bello,\u201d he said.\n\nUwazuruike, who is also the Founder of Biafran Independent Movement, said that he does not believe in a president of Igbo extraction, insisting that the contest should be thrown open.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd that had come to welcome him at the APC Secretariat last Wednesday, Bello had said, \u201cRight now, what we have ahead of us is a task of canvassing and consulting all party faithfuls, leaders, delegates and stalwarts, members and all Nigerians, at home and even in the diaspora to support us so that we become the flagbearer of this great party come 30 and 31 of May 2022. And by the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Member of the Federal House of Representatives, Dr. Dakuku Adol Peterside, has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for the immediate and unconditional release of the Member representing Bonny/Degema Federal Constituency, Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo, from detention.Peterside, who said Hon. Dagogo\u2019s arrest has no locus standi in any known Nigerian Law or Statue, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act, described Wike as a neo-fascist and dictator desperate to gag free speech and democratic rights of Rivers citizens.\n\nHe challenged the governor to justify his reasons for the arrest of the lawmaker other than his quest to remain a political alpha and omega who would not brood any fair contest. While insisting that the police also erred in executing the arrest without a known court warrant of arrest, Peterside vowed that Rivers State would not allow Wike to prosper in his quest to turn the state into an Italy of Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism held sway until the world rallied democracy against them. \u201cRivers State cannot become an Italy of Benito Mussolini, or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism and dictatorship contracted an evil marriage of convenience that bestrode and muzzled free speech and fundamental rights of citizens. What Wike is working at is to annex every independent mind and cow every Rivers citizen into sheepish acquiescence. But what he plays ignorant of is that from the times of Dappa Biriye, Melford Okilo, Obi Wali, TImothy Birabi, all nationalists and Democrats, Rivers had never suffered fools to muzzle them. So, we shall keep to that historic attitude and would never surrender to Wike and his goons.\u201d\n\nPeterside, who is the immediate past Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, queried Gov. Wike on how he obtained evidence linking the lawmaker to an alleged disruption of proceedings at the Rivers State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. \u201cWike had lied at several times such that these days his claims must be subjected to forensic investigation before believed. So, Rivers people need know how he proved Dagogo\u2019s link to whatever happened at their party Secretariat\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile calling on lovers of democracy and free speech to condemn Wike and his fascist style of governance, Peterside reiterated his 48-hour ultimatum to Gov. Wike to order the release of the detailed lawmaker. \u201cWike has 48 hours to ensure that Honourable Farah is set free and allowed to continue to pursue his political aspiration. Nothing short of that shall avail. Wike cannot be junketing in pursuit of his presidential ambition using Rivers State resources while wickedly gagging another\u2019s on the altar of ego. He must let Dagogo go\u201d, , Peterside averted.",

          "text": "The support groups of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu have declared that the rumoured presidential ambition of former President Goodluck Jonathan on the platform of the APC poses no threat to their principals.\n\nJonathan had recently revealed that he was still considering the call on him to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHowever, the support groups of the various presidential aspirants contesting on the platform of APC have insisted that the purported entrants of Jonathan into the race would not scuttle the chances of their principals ahead of the presidential primary of the party slated for May 30 and June 1, 2022.\n\nReacting, the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) said that it remained unperturbed about the speculation that Jonathan would contest on the platform of APC.\n\nTSG Head of Media, Mr. Tosin Adeyanju noted that Tinubu was already focused on the presidential primary and has been reaching out to delegates.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe more the merrier. We welcome everyone to the race. Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu is a democrat that believes in a democratic context. We are focused on the primaries, which is what the party constitution stipulates. We are equally reaching out to all delegates coming for the primaries.\n\n\u201cOther aspirants before him have equally dropped the president\u2019s name as the anointed one. \u201cTherefore, he will not be the last to say so moving towards primaries. The party must choose the most popular aspirant at the primaries in other for APC to be able to win the general election and our principal fit into this.\n\nAdeyanju thought that the purported coming of Jonathan to APC would not jeopardise the chances of the former Governor of Lagos state.\n\nHe added: \u201cHe will not (scuttle Tinubu\u2019s chances) because he would have to submit his credentials and records to the party delegates for scrutiny. Asiwaju\u2019s record speaks for him and that is why he is running on his record and his democratic credentials.\u201d\n\nAlso, Osinbajo Support Movement, said it has no reason to be jittery over the purported coming of Jonathan.\n\nThe Convener, Mr. Badmus Olawale, said the law signed by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018 forbids Jonathan from contesting in 2023.\n\nThe Act intends to ensure that where a Vice President succeeds that president and where a deputy governor succeeds a governor, he can no more contest for that office more than once more.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have no reason to (be jittery). First, the law signed by Mr. President about a sitting Vice President completing the tenure of his/her principal has stipulated that such a person can only contest once more \u2013 which means he cannot swear an oath for the office of the President more than twice. GEJ has completed the tenure of late Umar Yar\u2019Adua and he has equally contested on his own and won in 2011.\u201d\n\nOn the speculation that Jonathan might be anointed by Buhari, Olawale insisted that every aspirant contesting on the platform of APC needs the blessings of the President, adding that Jonathan is not a member of the APC.\n\nHe noted that it was laughable to abhor the thought that Jonathan\u2019s entrants into the race would scuttle Osinbajo\u2019s chances.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt will be laughable to even think such. How do we market him to the delegates, party members, and Nigerians in general despite our campaigns against him in 2015? Is the APC going to say, oh! we are sorry it was an error removing Jonathan and we want to bring him back?\u201d\n\nOn her part, the Head of Media, Governor Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, Ms. Yemi Kolapo said the former President was welcomed to the race just like other aspirants.\n\nShe added that regardless of the number of people that showed interest, Bello would be on the ballot.\n\nKolapo said: \u201cJonathan is welcome to APC just like others. The space is enough for all to fly. However, regardless of the number of people who show interest in the APC presidential ticket, Governor Yahaya Bello will be on the ballot.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the Personal Assistant/ Head of Media to the former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, Dr. Ebere Nzewuji said Okorocha stands out among all the aspirants given the mood of the nation now and his antecedents.\n\nHe said the ruling party knows Okorocha\u2019s credentials, adding that it doesn\u2019t matter if former President Jonathan joins the race.\n\nNzewuji noted that while the nation was threatened by people agitating for separation, insecurity, and a dwindling economy, Okorocha has his signature in all the nooks and crannies of the nation.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
          "summary": "Jonathan had recently revealed that he was still considering the call on him to contest the 2023 presidential election.\nReacting, the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) said that it remained unperturbed about the speculation that Jonathan would contest on the platform of APC.\nAdeyanju thought that the purported coming of Jonathan to APC would not jeopardise the chances of the former Governor of Lagos state.\nHe noted that it was laughable to abhor the thought that Jonathan\u2019s entrants into the race would scuttle Osinbajo\u2019s chances.\nHe said the ruling party knows Okorocha\u2019s credentials, adding that it doesn\u2019t matter if former President Jonathan joins the race.",

          "title": "OPEC Signs Deal to Fund Feasibility Study of $25bn Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline",
          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund has announced that it will contribute $14.3 million to Phase II of the feasibility study for the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline estimated at $25 billion.\n\nThis is coming as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has offset its cash call debts to International Oil Companies (IOCs) to the tune of $3.717 billion in the last six years, a new report by the national oil company has indicated.\n\nHowever, as the NNPC is reducing the debts owed the IOCs, rising petrol subsidy claims incurred by the company have continued to take tolls on the economy with analysts projecting that it will raise Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit to N10 trillion at the end of the year.\n\nTo be directly financed by the OPEC Fund for International Development (IFID), the intervention, OPEC said, is meant to support the Moroccan government\u2019s national development strategy aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon energy system.\n\nAccording to OPEC, it will further diversify the country\u2019s energy mix and help it in achieving its renewable energy commitments.\n\nThe study will carry out detailed evaluations of the implementation and design process for the eventual construction of the gas pipeline, thus facilitating the final investment decision.\n\nOPEC Fund\u2019s contribution, the organisation added, will specifically co-finance the survey works for the North Area (Senegal \u2013 Mauritania \u2013 Morocco) of the NMGP.\n\nMorocco and the OPEC Fund signed an agreement at the weekend to jointly fund the feasibility study ahead of the construction of the world\u2019s longest offshore pipeline connecting Nigeria to Morocco.\n\nThe gas pipeline project would cover 7,000 kilometres through 13 West African countries, and extend to Europe, according to Worley, the company handling the current phase of the project.\n\nIt was further learnt that the London team of the Australian energy firm will deliver the onshore part of the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study, including the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Land Acquisition Studies (LAS), on the proposed pipeline from Nigeria to Morocco.\n\nMorocco\u2019s Economy and Finance Minister, Nadia Fettah, signed the agreement alongside the Director-General of the OPEC Fund, Abdulhamid Al khalifa, and Managing Director of Morocco\u2019s National Office for Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONYHM), Amina Benkhadra.\n\nCo-financed with the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the study comprises a body of research on the execution of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline, including the technical, financial, and legal aspects, a statement after the event indicated.\n\nLaunched through a joint initiative in 2017, the pipeline is set to boost local economies\u2019 competitiveness by providing secure access to an energy source and aims to deliver gas from Nigeria to Europe as well as supply countries along the way. In December 2021, Morocco and Nigeria signed an agreement to fund the FEED after the project was approved by the IDB. Morocco and Nigeria agreed to provide joint funding for the mega project. The FEED study is projected to cost $90.1 million in total.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in 2021, held a phone call with Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI, where the Nigerian leader expressed his country\u2019s determination to bring the pipeline online as soon as possible, according to a report by Morocco World News.\n\nBased on the 25-year estimate given in 2017, the construction of the $25 billion projects is expected to be completed by 2046.\n\nThe pipeline would connect Nigerian gas to every coastal country in West Africa (Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania), ending at Tangiers, Morocco, and C\u00e1diz, Spain.\n\nNNPC Slashes Cash Call Arrears by $3.717bn in Six Years\n\nMeanwhile, NNPC Limited has offset its cash call debts to the IOCs to the tune of $3.717 billion in the last six years, a new report by the national oil company has indicated.\n\nData from the NNPC showed that $3.717 billion has been paid in the last six years out of the $4.689 billion debts owed to the five joint venture partners.\n\nOut of the $3.717 billion paid during the period under review, about $40 million was paid in March 2022, leaving a balance of $971,817,730.\n\nIn its presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) in April, the NNPC indicated that it has reduced the 2016 renegotiated debt to less than $1 billion.\n\nThe five oil majors initially owed by the national oil company were: Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Mobil Producing, Nigeria, Chevron Nigeria Limited, Total Exploration as well as Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC). However, the debts owed Mobil and Chevron have been fully paid by the NNPC\n\nMobil and Chevron had a renegotiated debt of $833.751 million and $1.097 billion respectively. Shell\u2019s initial $1.372 billion has been reduced to $595.1 million.\n\nSimilarly, Total\u2019s $610.9 million has been reduced to $152.06 million, while NAOC has a balance of $224 million from the initial $774.66 million in 2016.\n\nCash calls are requests sent by JV operators to non-operating partners for payment in the light of anticipated future capital, operating expenditures or as additional capital contributions.\n\nThe NNPC had in 2016, signed a cash call repayment agreement with its JV partners to defray cash-call arrears within five years after many years of its indebtedness to its partners.\n\nBefore then, it had consistently for years failed to meet its indebtedness to the IOCs, a situation the operators said caused a loss of new investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nPetrol Subsidy Payments to Raise Fiscal Deficit to N10tn in 2022\n\nIn another development, rising petrol subsidy claims incurred by the NNPC have continued to take tolls on the economy with analysts projecting that it will raise Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit to N10 trillion at the end of the year.\n\nThe development, according to economic analysts from Afrinvest Securities Limited, will weigh heavily on Nigeria\u2019s growing debt profile with a correspondent fall in capital expenditure.\n\nIn the April edition of the Afrinvest Monthly Market Report, which was released on Saturday, analysts from the research firm noted that a revised expenditure plan passed by the National Assembly in April brought about a 702.0 per cent surge in the provision for petrol subsidy payment for 2022 to N3.6 trillion.\n\nThis, the report said, followed the 18 months postponement of the implementation period of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, which ought to have ended the subsidy regime by February 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, the revised expenditure plan showed that the federal government\u2019s revenue projection for 2022 was lowered by N772.9billion to N9.97trillion, thus expanding the estimated fiscal deficit for the year by 15.1 per cent to N7.4trillion.\n\nThe report, however, maintained that given its weak optimism about the likely improvement in revenue from oil and gas, and the independent revenue from other sources, the actual deficit for 2022 will be in the threshold of N10trillion.\n\nThe report stated: \u201cFirst, on the domestic scene, the National Assembly in April passed the revised N17.3trillion expenditure plan for the executive in 2022, which translates to an increase of N192.5 billion over the amount earlier passed in December 2021.\n\n\u201cThe revised expenditure plan saw non-debt recurrent expenditure and debt service provisions rise by 2.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively to N7.1trillion and N4 trillion, while provisions for statutory transfers and capital expenditure were lowered by 6 per cent and 1 per cent to N800 million and N5.4 trillion respectively. The increase in the non-debt expenditure was largely due to the 702.0 per cent surge in provision for petrol subsidy payment for 2022 to N3.6 trillion, following the 18 months postponement of the implementation period of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, which ought to have ended the subsidy regime by February 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report said the increase in debt service provision is to cushion the knock-on effect of the rising interest rate environment in the external and domestic debt market amid rising inflationary pressure.\n\nIt noted however that \u201cSadly, the federal government\u2019s revenue projection for 2022 was lowered by N772.9 billion to N9.97 trillion, hence, expanding the estimated fiscal deficit for the year by 15.1 per cent to N7.4 trillion.\u201d\n\nThe report maintained that \u201cGiven our weak optimism about the likely improvement in revenue from oil and gas, independent revenue, and revenue from other sources as earlier captured in our January 2022 macroeconomic outlook report (A Mix of a Boom & Gloom), we maintain that actual deficit for 2022 may top N10 trillion.\u201d\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
