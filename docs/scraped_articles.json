          "text": "Security experts have said correctional officials cannot be absolved from the incessant attacks on the correctional centres in the country.\n\nThe experts, in separate interviews, insisted that it is impossible for attacks to have taken place without the connivance of some officials.\n\nOne of them, Jackson Ojo, said, \u201cBefore you can have a jailbreak, there must have been internal collaborations. You must have some officials who have been bribed.\n\nWhat they are doing is strategic and there are lots of people involved. Politicians or agitators might be involved.\n\n\u201cThis is becoming a pattern. Our prisons need serious fortification, installation of security cameras. Bring in competent workers.\u201d\n\nAlso, a security and intelligence expert, Kabiru Adamu, said the integrity of some of the custodian centres were in doubt, adding that the use of mobile phones, as well as corrupt officials, could be responsible for the attacks.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe reason many of them are in detention is because they have committed crime and there is a likelihood that if they escape, they will continue. Unfortunately, this will increase insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe integrity of our custodian centres is in question. Any good security programme has three things \u2013 people, physical security and processes. These things are deficient in our custodian centres.\n\n\u201cAlso, when inmates are allowed access to telephone and communicate with people outside and even bribe officials, attacks are inevitable.\u201d\n\nHe advised the government to improve physical security, build buffer zones and co-opt residents of the host communities of the correctional centres for intelligence to end the scourge.\n\n\u201cAlso, the use of telephones by inmates should be prohibited in our custodian centre,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother security expert, Timothy Avele said, \u201cThe major cause of this increasing prison breaks is lack of actionable intelligence and counter-intelligence by prisons intelligence units.\n\n\u201cOf course, this also applies to other intelligence agencies. Before any prison break, the criminals must do a dry run or rehearsal. I feel there are insiders in all these breaks. It will be safe to say that our prisons are not safe.\u201d\n\nAvele called on the authorities to retrain personnel in the intelligence units and implement all-round technology-assisted facility monitoring linked to central monitoring system.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has said the Federal Government has started infrastructural upgrade in all correctional centres in the country.\n\nHe also said security around the facilities had been stepped up.\n\nAregbesola spoke through his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, in an interview on Monday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe facilities are being beefed up with more armed personnel drawn from across the services. More sophisticated equipment that will withstand external attacks are being supplied.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE fate of the erstwhile Commander, Intelligence Response Team, Abba Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is hanging in the balance as the Police Service Commission awaits the recommendations of the Force Disciplinary Committee on his case.\n\nIt was gathered that the FDC\u2019s recommendations would form the crux of the commission\u2019s decision and also determine Kyari\u2019s future in the Nigeria Police.\n\nOur correspondent had reported that the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, last month dispatched the Special Investigation Panel report on Kyari\u2019s alleged roles in the $1.1m fraud perpetrated by an Instagram influencer, Abbas Ramon, popularly known as Hushpuppi and four others, to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and the PSC.\n\nThe report contained the case file, evidence and findings as well as testimonies from Kyari and other persons and groups linked to the matter.\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, Andrew Innocenti, had in a document titled, \u2018Criminal complaint by telephone or other reliable electronic means\u2019 filed before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged that Hushpuppi contracted Kyari to detain a co-conspirator, Chibuzo Vincent, for threatening to expose the alleged $1.1m fraud committed against a Qatari businessman.\n\nThe agency also said Hushpuppi paid $20,600 into a bank account provided by Kyari.\n\nThe court consequently ordered that Kyari be detained for 10 days.\n\nHushpuppi has pleaded guilty to money laundering and is expected to spend 20 years in prison.\n\nA date is to be fixed for Hushpuppi to change his previous not guilty plea to guilty, which would be followed by a sentencing hearing for the judge to determine how long he will spend in jail.\n\nKyari was suspended from service on July 31 following alleged involvement in the fraud. He also appeared before the SIP.\n\nThe SIP Chairman, Joseph Egbunike, a Deputy Inspector-General of Police, submitted the panel\u2019s findings to the IGP on August 26, at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, 24 days after the panel was inaugurated.\n\nGiving an update on the case on Wednesday, a senior official explained that Kyari has responded to a query from the FDC, adding that the committee is expected to come up with recommendations based on his response and the facts contained in the SIP report.\n\nThe source stated, \u201cThe case is still with the Force Disciplinary Committee which handles cases of misconduct and unprofessional acts by senior officers.\n\n\u201cAfter the SIP report was submitted to the AGF and the Police Service Commission, Kyari was queried and he answered the query.\n\n\u201cThe FDC is expected to draw up recommendations which would be forwarded to the PSC for deliberation and action.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, the DCP\u2019s fate is hanging in the balance. Ultimately, his future in the police would be determined by the police service commission.\u201d\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, did not respond to request for an update on the case.\n\nCalls to his phone rang out and he had yet to respond to an SMS as of the time of filing this report.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Jobs recovery is stalled worldwide and disparities between advanced and developing economies is threatening the whole global economy, the International Labour Organisation, ILO, warned on Wednesday.\n\nThe agency is projecting that global hours worked this year will be 4.3 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, the equivalent of 125 million full time jobs.\n\nThis is a dramatic revision of the projection made in June, of 3.5 per cent or 100 million full-time jobs.\n\nThe eighth edition of the ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work also warns of a \u201cgreat divergence\u201d between developed and developing countries, saying it will persist without concrete financial and technical support.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, total hours worked in high-income countries were 3.6 per cent lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic hit.\n\nBy contrast, the gap in low-income countries stood at 5.7 per cent and in lower middle-income countries at 7.3 per cent.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, Europe and Central Asia experienced the smallest loss in hours, around 2.5 per cent. This was followed by Asia and the Pacific at 4.6 per cent.\n\nAfrica, the Americas and Arab States showed declines of 5.6, 5.4 and 6.5 per cent respectively.\n\nThis great divergence is largely driven by major differences in the roll-out of vaccinations and fiscal stimulus packages.\n\nEstimates indicate that for each 14 persons fully vaccinated in the second quarter of 2021, one full-time equivalent job was added to the global labour market. This substantially boosted the recovery.\n\nIn the absence of any vaccines, globally, the loss in hours worked would have stood at six per cent in the second quarter of 2021, rather than the 4.8 per cent recorded.\n\nThe highly uneven vaccine roll out, means that the effect was largest in high-income countries, negligible in lower middle-income countries and almost zero in low-income countries.\n\nAccording to ILO, these imbalances could be rapidly addressed through greater global solidarity in respect of vaccines.\n\nThe agency estimates that if low-income countries had more equitable access to vaccines, working-hour recovery would catch up with richer economies in just over one quarter.\n\nFiscal stimulus continued to be the other key factor in the trajectories of recovery. However, the gap remains largely unaddressed, with around 86 per cent of all measures concentrated in high-income countries.\n\nOn average, an increase in fiscal stimulus of one per cent of annual GDP increased annual working hours by 0.3 percentage points relative to the last quarter of 2019.\n\nThe crisis has also impacted productivity, leading to greater disparities. The productivity gap between advanced and developing countries is projected to widen to the highest level since 2005.\n\nILO Director-General, Guy Ryder, highlighted the unequal vaccine distribution and fiscal capacities saying that \u201cboth need to be addressed urgently.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "FEC approves NNPC to fix 21 federal roads at N621.2bn",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, has approved for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) to take over the reconstruction of 21 federal roads across the six geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nThis is in line with Executive Order No. 007 of 2019 cited as the Companies Income Tax (Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme) Order, 2019 (\u201cEO7 of 2019\u201d or \u201cthe Scheme\u201d), signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nDangote Group was the first to take advantage of the EO7 of 2019 to fix the Obajana-Kabba road from it\u2019s income tax.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nRecall the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) had suspended it\u2019s earlier plannd nationwide strike that was to hold on October 11th to give negotiations a chance, after the NNPC warned that the strike could disrupt fuel supplies.\n\nNUPENG had called the strike to protest against the poor state of roads in the country, saying the situation endangers the lives of drivers.\n\nBriefing State House Correspondents at the end of the council meeting, the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, SAN, the selected 21 roads are 1804.6 kilometers.\n\nThe Minister said it was a strategic intervention under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nFashola fuether explained that under Executive Order 7, it allows the private sector to deploy in advance the taxes they would pay for infrastructure development.\n\nHe said nine of the selected projects are in North Central, three in North East, two in North West, two in South East, three in South-South, and two in South West.\n\nFashola speaking more on council\u2019s approval, said he presented three memoranda to the Council that were approved, explaining that two of the memoranda were on road contracts.\n\nHe said the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road especially the section to Apet Central where he said had a problem with steelreinforced drain that was discovered there.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction in order to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replaced them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved.\n\n\u201cThe second memorandum relates to the road infrastructure tax credit scheme. You recall the Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\n\u201cSo you recall that I had briefed you here about the use of that policy like the Dangote Group from Obajana to Kabba, Apapa to Oworoshoki.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads, the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto and couple of others and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was approved about N320 something billion.\n\n\u201cSo today, we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and committed to deploy taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC. So NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. So now the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps government to achieve many things, including Ministerial Mandates Three and Four, which we discussed at the last retreat if you recall was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across th country.\n\n\u201cOf course petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure, which is the Ministerial mandate four.\n\n\u201cSo, NNPC has sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the Six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North Central, particularly Niger state. And the reason is that Niger State is a major storage center for NNPC. So the reason NNPC is doing this is to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen and have heard every year Niger State gridlock, the governor complaning that his roads are being damaged by trucks, by those who overload the trucks after damaging the roads themselves now protest the damage that they sometimes have induced. Anyway, this is the final solution to that problem.\n\n\u201cSo there are nine like that in north central, there are three in the Northeast. Two in the northwest, two in the southeast, three roads, the entire Odupani \u2013 Itu \u2013 Ikot Ekpene road in LOT 1, 2 and 3 now fully covered.\n\n\u201cThen in the southwest, you have the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the entire junction and you also have the Ibadan to Ilorin in Oyo-Ogbumosho section. So that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cIn the south east you have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuano to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth. In the Northwest, it is Gada-Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau -Gusau-Sokoto road.\n\n\u201cIn the northeast, it is Cham-, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road. The roads impacted in north central include Ilorin -Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani sections I and II, Suleja-Minna sections I and II, Bida-Lambatta, and then Agaie-Katcha-Baro road. Then Mokwa-Makera-Tegina-Kaduna all in Niger State.\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, it is a total of 21 roads. What will happen as a result of this is that there will be no financing problems with regarding the execution of these roads anymore. So, some of these roads that I have mentioned, let me tell you, what has changed. For example, Aba-Ikot Ekpene road has an estimate of about N30.33,399 billion to complete it. The provision in the budget this year is only N200 million. If you look at Suleja-Minna road section II, it has N25.763 billion to complete it. The provision in the budget this year is just N100 million. So, with this intervention, all those roads now will be fully funded, we won\u2019t have budgetry challenges and financing challenges. So, council approved this as a strategic funding these roads.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the payment for total sum for the 21 road contracts was not a one off payment.\n\nFashola said, \u201cThe whole package is N621,237,143,897.75 billion. Let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax for about three years. On time frame of completion, the completion time already exist. They have scheduled completion times. What has hobbled and hampered them is that the annual budgetary provisions have not been enough. So, what it does now is that government can save, like the Lagos-Ibadan, 2nd Niger bridge arrangement and all of those type roads.\u201d\n\nOn if government will still go ahead to release the funds budgeted for the roads to be fixed by NNPC, he said: \u201cWhat you see here is that, I mentioned some cases, like for the Oku Iboku power plant section, it has N79 billion to finish, there was no provision at all in the 2021 budget. In the places where there\u2019s provision maybe N100 million, we are more than halfway to the budget we started implementing, so it probably has been paid and where it has not been paid, the certificate is pending, we will pay and from then on, we will move to the new financing structuring just as we transited the second Niger Bridge, the Lagos-Ibadan expressway from the old budgetary arrangement to the new arrangement. We will transit this too. So those are administrative thing and we will be meeting all the contractors to review all the agreements and all the performance and then we will take it from there.\n\nAlso briefing, the Minister of Power, Aliyu Abubakar said he presented three memos which sought approval for the award of contract for design, manufacture, supply, construction of 55 Kilometer Agu Akwa Umuchu 132 KVA double circuit transmission line and substation having two transformers two by 60 MVA at Umuchu Umuchu with two by 132 KV line bay extension at Agu Akwa for transmission company of Nigeria (TCN).\n\nThis, according to the Minister, is between Anambra and Enugu State.\n\nHe said Council approved the contract in Favour of Messrs Cartlark International Limited and has dollar and Naira components respectively to finance the project.\n\n\u201cThe naira component is N4,044,309,380.69 inclusive of 7.5% VAT and 7.5% contingency payable to the Central Bank of Nigeria at the prevailing exchange rate with the completion period of 34 months. This is part of the expansion and modernization of the TCN transmission grid and council has approved that.\n\n\u201cThe second one was approval for award of contract for a procurement and supply of two \u201cFail Safe\u201d 60 MVA, 132 /33KV transformers for transmission Company of Nigeria. They are protecting themselves against fire outbreak.\n\n\u201cThey are made in a way that once there is any fire outbreak it will not affect the transformers. So, these are modern equipments that are being procured to replace the old one, this is also part of the modernization of the equipment on the transmission lines.\n\n\u201cSo, the total control sum is N1,018,432,930.68 made up of \u20ac1,904,237.50 (offshore component) plus N155,875,000 (onshore component) inclusive of 7.5% VAT, with delivery period of nine months. This was also approved by council.\n\n\u201cThe third one is approval for variation of an ongoing contract for the construction of two by MVA 330 132/33 KV two by 60 MVA 132/33 KV substations, these are all transformers. And four by 330 KV line bay extension at Akure, and four by 330 KV line bay extension each Ochigbo and Benin north was awarded by the ministerial attenders board MTV commercials to messers Metelak SAL Engineering and constructing limited, on 27 September 2011, in the sum of $19,025,535.45 plus N1,068,728,996 inclusive of 5% VAT as at that time. So, it became obvious and necessary to seek for this variation.\n\n\u201cSo, the contractor requested and the necessary checks were done and the contract is now being increased by this memo to the council.\n\n\u201cThis approval seek to increase the contract amount from the amount stated. The offshore components still remains, the onshore is now increased to N1,460,398,661.75. This is with inclusive of 7.5% VAT and the council graciously approved this. So, there is an increase of the sum of N377,669,675.75.\n\n\u201cBut this is not a one off payment. So, let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax of about three years. On time frame of completion, the completion time already exist. They have scheduled completion times.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has said despite the fact that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has zoned its national chairmanship to the North Central, it did not prevent any qualified aspirant from any zone from contesting the presidency in 2023.\n\nSpeaking on a national television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday, the former Kwara State governor debunked speculations that the party would zone its presidency to the south since it zoned its national chairmanship to the north.\n\nHe said the leadership of the party had at different fora reiterated its commitment to throwing open the contest for the 2023 presidential ticket to all zones as long as it gets the best candidate from the process.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of zoning, the party has made it very clear in all our meetings that even though we have zoned the position of party offices, it does not preclude anybody that has any presidential ambition. Most of our leaders have said that, and we have said that at our NEC, and all the possible meetings, that even though we have taken the chairmanship of the party to the North Central, it does not preclude anyone from contesting. What we are looking for is the best candidate that would win the election.\u201d\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nSaraki said the party was undaunted by the defection of three of its governors (Ebonyi, Zamfara and Cross River), federal and state legislators, saying that such actions were expected. He, however, said the PDP will receive a former governor into its fold this week, and that Nigerians should not be surprise if bigwigs from the All Progressives Congress (APC) defect to the PDP when the 2023 elections draws closer.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that we are haemorrhaging members because I had said it a couple of times that there were certain governors that we knew were going to leave. In fact, they had left, but we were just waiting for their final exit, so we were not surprised. We have got some big wigs that will be coming to our party this week, there is a former governor that would join us and you should know that when leaders in the ruling party want to defect, they don\u2019t defect early. I think Nigerians should not be surprised when they begin to see some defections from the ruling party.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, the number of states that APC has now is almost the same as what we had in the PDP, and the concern that people are defecting should not matter. More importantly, the country is in a different place now and Nigerians have seen what the ruling party has to offer. We all have differences in our party and we are resolving because this is the only alternative party for Nigerians that would provide leadership, that is why we in the PDP believe that the interest of Nigerians should supersede our individual interests. We have been able to resolve our differences across the states so that we can convince Nigerians that we are able to take over the leadership of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if he will contest for the presidency in 2023, he said it was too early for anyone to declare such ambition even as he debunked speculations that if he contested and lost, he would leave the PDP.\n\n\u201cBecause some people defected from the PDP to APC does not mean that I would defect. You have to look at my antecedents in 2019 and you will see that the fact that I didn\u2019t win elections didn\u2019t make me defect, so I can\u2019t see why that would come up. Where we are now is not about anyone\u2019s personal ambition, it is about how we can work to make this country better. What is important for us is to build a strong party and that was why I took up the responsibility of leading the reconciliation committee because there was concern that the party was losing a lot of steam. We can\u2019t talk about our ambition without a strong party and in due time I will answer the question of whether I will contest or not.\u201d\n\nOn the court case brought against the PDP by its former national chairman, Uche Secondus, he said: \u201cWe have a court case involving him because he is still our chairman, but we are looking beyond that and looking at our congress. Do we look like a party that is resolving its issues and trying to move forward to its convention to elect new leaders? Today, we are not meeting to resolve state congresses because we have been able to move forward. We cannot afford to get it wrong in 2023 and PDP is in a better position to give credible leadership.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria needs $2.7bn to improve products supply, distribution infrastructure\n\n\u2022Projects petroleum products demand to grow to 17.3m MT by 2025\n\nPeter Uzoho\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said investment opportunities worth nearly $3.097 billion currently exist in the country\u2019s condensate refineries\u2019 space. Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated this yesterday in Lagos in his keynote address at the 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Downstream Week.\n\nKyari said between $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion were required by the corporation to improve the supply and distribution of petroleum products, revamp Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) infrastructure, and build Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) plants in the country.\n\nKyari, who was represented at the event by the Group Executive Director, Downstream, NNPC, Mr. Adetunji Adeyemi, projected that Nigeria\u2019s petroleum product demand would grow to 17.3 million metric tons by 2025, up from the 15.1 million MT in 2020.\n\nThe theme of the conference was, \u201cDownstream in Transition: Getting Set.\u201d\n\nKyari added that the country would need a refining capacity of about 1.52 million barrels per stream day (MBPSD) to meet its petrol requirement in the next four years.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs Nigeria\u2019s demand for petroleum products is expected to grow from 15.1 million MT in 2020 to 17.3 million MT by 2025, the country needs a refining capacity of about 1.52 million barrels per stream day (MBPSD), to meet its PMS requirement in the next four years.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries\u2019 445,000 BPSD and Dangote Refinery\u2019s 650,000 BPSD running at 60 per cent and nameplate capacity, respectively, would supply 76 per cent of that requirement, leaving a shortfall of about 17 million litres of PMS daily.\n\n\u201cNNPC is adding 215,000 BPSD of refining capacity through private sector driven co-location at the existing facilities in PHRC and WRPC, respectively. Modular refineries are also adding capacities, such as the 5,000 BPSD Waltersmith refinery, which will be upgraded to 50,000 BPSD.\n\n\u201cAdditional 250,000 BSPD is expected to come from the Condensate Refineries through the private sector partnership. The co-location and condensate refineries will close the PMS supply-demand gap and create positive returns to the investors.\n\n\u201cAbout $3.097 billion investment opportunities exist in condensate refineries while $1.6 \u2013 $2.7 billion is required by NNPC to improve the supply and distribution petroleum of products, revamp LPG infrastructure and build CNG plants.\u201d\n\nKyari said the demand for natural gas could grow about four times over the next decade, increasing from 4.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in 2020 to between 10 \u2013 23 bcf/d in 2030.\n\nHe said currently, supply to the domestic market was about 8bcf/d to power, 0.77 bcf/d to industries, and about 54 bcf/d was flared, while 3.2 bcf/d was for export gas through the LNG and the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).\n\nAccording to him, achieving this growth in demand would be occasioned by increasing the dispatchable capacity of existing power in line with the Presidential Power Initiative, which is less than 1.4 bcf/d).\n\nHe added that the growth would be achieved through assuring delivery of major fertiliser projects (Dangote, Brass) 5 bcf/d), and enabling industrial demand for natural gas in the northern axis of the country (1.2 bcf/d).\n\nOn the global oil market outlook, Kyari said, \u201cSome $10.4 trillion global stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rebound in consumers\u2019 spending while incentives for long-term investments in hydrocarbon has waned.\u201d\n\nHe stated that hydrocarbon would continue to be relevant in the global energy mix for the next two decades, quoting the recent data by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nAccording to the data, the world oil demand was expected to rise from a pandemic stricken 90.6 million bpd in 2020 to 108.2 million bpd in 2045, thereby accounting for 28 per cent of global energy needs. The OPEC data further stated that the rise in demand would be driven by growth in world population, which is set to expand to 9.5 billion by 2045, and the huge potential for expanding access to modern energy services for the under-served.\n\n\u201cHowever, $11.8 trillion in oil-related investments will be required mostly in the US upstream to meet the market needs,\u201d Kyari noted.\n\nOn the issue of downstream in transition, the NNPC boss noted that the Nigerian oil and gas industry has been in transition prior to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) passage in response to the global energy transition and decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nKyari maintained that it would be difficult to discuss the transition in the downstream sub-sector in isolation from the overall evolution that was happening in the industry.

          "text": "\u2022Appeals to judges, lawyers not to destroy judiciary\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nChief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, has once again brought to the fore the indiscriminate issuance of injunctive orders by courts across the country, warning that such acts continue to erode public confidence in the country\u2019s judiciary. Muhammad recalled that the reckless granting of ex parte orders reached a worrisome height recently, and he had to warn some judges to desist from such conduct.\n\nMuhammad made the assertions yesterday during the swearing in ceremony for Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf as the substantive Chief Judge (CJ) of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, which held at the Supreme Court complex, Abuja.\n\nThe CJN took a swipe at the judges and lawyers who went about forum shopping, cautioning that their actions could bring down not only the judiciary, but also the entire nation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAn occasion like this may be auspicious for self-assessment. It is by co-incidence that this event comes at a time the Nigerian Bar Association is holding its 61st Annual General Conference tagged: \u2018Taking The Lead\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe legal profession should, indeed, take the lead in all human affairs. However, the lead is at a price. We cannot take the lead when our courts issue ex-parte orders recklessly.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take the lead when many litigants with support of their counsel engage in forum shopping. We cannot take the lead when counsels file a case before a court that they know lacks jurisdiction and the judge proceeds to hear the case. We cannot take the lead when counsel files frivolous cases in our courts just for nuisance value or to buy time.\u201d\n\nTo stem the tide, the CJN stated that the judiciary must not only do self-assessment, but also needed self-cleansing, adding that all hands must be on deck from both the Bar and the Bench to rid the legal profession of bad eggs.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe legal profession is the building under which we are sheltered. If we fold our hands and watch others destroy it or we participate in the destruction, it will collapse on us. We will then have no roof over our heads. May God forbid!\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating Justice Baba-Yusuf on his appointment, the CJN prayed to God to guide, protect and assist him in the discharge of his duty as head of court.\n\nHe told Baba-Yusuf that as head of court, his burden had become heavier.\n\n\u201cYou should, therefore, take charge and ensure that you are just and fair to your brother judges, the management, staff, and, most importantly, to the litigants,\u201d the CJN counselled the new FCT Chief Judge.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Politicians Still Influencing Judges to Use Court against Democracy",
          "text": "Alexander Enumah\n\nWeeks after the Chief Justice of Nigeria (NJC), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, who was angered by conflicting orders from courts of coordinate jurisdictions, issued a stern warning to judges on the need to act right in nation\u2019s interest, it appears an end is not in sight yet to the impunity of some of the judges and justices in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, the unsavoury dispositions of some of the justices and judges to democratic concerns, have continued to decimate the gains of the nation\u2019s 23 years of unbroken civil rule. Even when they know full well they lack the jurisdiction to entertain the matters, they still go ahead to hear and pronounce ruling, which becomes an albatross on the neck of the party it was obtained against.\n\nThe submission of a majority of the people is that if the trend persisted, the fourth republic, which prides itself as the longest in the history of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, might come to an abrupt end going by the recent activities of desperate politicians and their cohorts in the judiciary.\n\nOne of the recent indicators to this unending judicial rascality could be located in how some individuals had rushed to court to stop the forthcoming national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the manner the courts have been encouraging the resort to destabilisation.\n\nNational Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) of the PDP raised the alarm about a suit filed at the Kaduna High Court, ostensibly to derail the October 30 and 31 national convention and advised party members to be wary of such disgruntled and misguided members of the party.\n\nAlthough details of the suit have remained sketchy, it was allegedly filed by an aide to a former Vice President, Namadi Sambo. But the aide, said to be close to Secondus, has however denied having anything to do with the suit.\n\nSecretary of the NCOC and Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said, \u201cNotwithstanding their right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to air their grievances, we maintain that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP has acted in good faith in fixing our convention for October 30 and 31. It is not meant to witch-hunt anyone or to truncate anyone\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all members and supporters of the PDP to ignore this distraction as we prepare to host a convention that will send a clear signal to Nigerians that the PDP is the only party that has the will and the might to rescue Nigeria from the catastrophe that we have been enduring for the past six years.\u201d\n\nBut Secondus had through his lawyer, Mr Tayo Oyetiba, SAN, asked the PDP to shelve the planned convention slated for October 30 and 31, pending the determination of Secondus\u2019 appeal.\n\nThe appeal with the number CA/PH/341/2021, is seeking to quash his suspension and applied for \u201cAn order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6 respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nThe hearing of the appeal as well as the motion for interlocutory injunction comes up today, Tuesday, October 26, at the Port Harcourt Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nWhether the appellate court would accede to the demand or not is another, particularly, taking into consideration the recent position of appellate court justices with respect to exparte granted by High Court judges.\n\nIt is worthy of mention that the appellate court and even the Supreme Court had descended heavily on the High Court judges particularly, in the Anambra governorship suits.\n\nJustice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal had in a ruling on August 2, in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), governorship tussle, called for sanction against two judges in the Jigawa and Imo States High Court for what she described as professional misconduct. She also called for sanctions for lawyers, who aided politicians in the filing of all such applications that had brought the court to ridicule.\n\nSimilarly, Justice Hamma Zamani of the Kano Division of the Court of Appeal had on August 10 in his judgment, set aside the judgment of a Jigawa State High Court, which had earlier declared Jude Okeke and Chukwuma Umeoji as the APGA national chairman and governorship candidate respectively.\n\nThe appellate court claimed that the trial court erred by entertaining a suit wherein it lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, also in a judgment on October 14, 2021, upheld the decision of Justice Zamani of the Kano division of the Appeal Court for nullifying the judgment of the High Court for want of jurisdiction.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the internal issue of political parties\u2019 was outside the jurisdiction of courts and consequently upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which resolved the leadership tussle in APGA in favour of Victor Oye and also upheld the primary election conducted by his leadership, which produced Professor Chukwuma Soludo as APGA\u2019s governorship candidate for the November 6 governorship election.\n\nSoludo was nominated candidate of APGA in the forthcoming governorship poll by the Oye faction and his nomination was accepted by INEC. But Okeke challenged the authenticity of the Oye leadership at a Federal High Court in Jigawa State, where judgment was given in his favour.\n\nHowever, the Jigawa Judgment was set aside by the Appeal Court leading him to proceed to the apex court to upturn the appellate court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe seven member panel of the apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Mary Odili, held that it was clear that the appellant engaged in abuse of judicial process, because the subject matter of the suit was not justiciable as it bordered on the internal matters of a political party.\n\nWhile the panel berated lawyers to the appellant for engaging in unethical conduct by filing such suit in the first place, it blamed the Jigawa High Court judge for accepting to hear the suit that was outside his jurisdiction. The panel went on to slam a fine of N1 million against the appellant for abuse of court process.\n\nAside the judges, the umbrella body for lawyers, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), had also condemned the development and promised to deal with lawyers engaging in acts capable of bringing the judiciary to disrepute.\n\nA statement by its National President in September, Mr. Olumide Akpata, described as unfortunate, the recurring trend of contradictory court orders especially amongst courts of coordinate jurisdiction. He cited the recent cases involving the Anambra State forthcoming election and the PDP leadership crisis, which according to him \u201cevokes memories of those eerie and unwanted dark days.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA will continue to stay away from the political ramifications and machinations involved in these matters, it is self-evident that these developments in our courts are antithetical to the actualisation of the just society and independent judiciary that we all aspire to, and they run contrary to everything we teach and hold dear as a profession.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a swirling belief that of the three judges under probe, one or two were involved in the PDP leadership crisis suit. While Justice O. Gbasam of a High Court of Rivers State, had on August 23, 2021 issued an order of interim injunction restraining Secondus from carrying on as Chairman of the PDP, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office, Justice Nusirat Umar of the Kebbi State High Court, issued another order on Secondus to return to his position as the National Chairman on August 26.\n\nThe judge made the order while delivering ruling in a suit marked KB/AC/M. 170/2021, filed by three concerned members of the party, Yahaya Usman, Abubakar mohammed and Bashar Suleman.\n\nJustice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affavidit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\nBut before Secondus could carry out the order, Justice Edem Kooffreh of a Cross River State High Court on August 28, restrained him from resuming.\n\nThe amusing thing about all the orders is that they were not only issued by courts of coordinate jurisdiction, but were all based on exparte applications.\n\nAttempt to rid the judiciary of bad eggs started, when the National Judicial Council (NJC) under the chairmanship of the CJN, constituted an investigative panel to probe the three High Court judges over their alleged indiscriminate issuance of court orders, an act perceived as detrimental to the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nA statement by the Director of Information, NJC, Mr Soji Oye, read, \u201cThe National Judicial Council under the Chairmanship of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice I. T. Muhammad, at its 95th Meeting held on September 15 and 16, 2021, in line with the principles of fair hearing, has directed the three Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, who granted Exparte Orders over the same case with the same subject matter to appear before a special Investigation Committee constituted by the Council in order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for such act\u201d.\n\nAlthough, the names of the judges and the jurisdiction they operated were not made public, they were however believed to be amongst the six jurisdictions of the High Court whose heads were summoned by the CJN in August, to explain the rationale behind the issuance of conflicting others by judges in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe letter dated August 30, read in part: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to media reports to the effect that some Courts of coordinate jurisdiction were granting conflicting Exparte Orders on the same subject matter.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient for me to invite you for a detailed briefing on the development. This is even more compelling having regard to earlier NJC Warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in granting Ex-parte applications\u201d.\n\nFrom the tone of the letter, it was obvious that the CJN was not only worried but also bitter over the development, which sources around the CJN noted was a huge embarrassment tothe Nigerian judiciary and the country at large.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing probe of the three judges on Monday in Abuja, an official of the NJC, who did not want his name mentioned, said the probe was ongoing and once the committee concluded its job, which he believed was in no distant time, the council would look into it and take critical decisions to serve as a warning to others if the said judges were guilty of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe committee is still sitting, you know they have to give them fair hearing, they will bring their lawyers to defend them, afterwards the committee will now recommend them to the plenary of the NJC. It is the NEC meeting that will determine, whatever the plenary agrees is the final decision,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it is difficult to comprehend what would make a judge assume jurisdiction in a case he knew he lacked any, the level of condemnation and fines against politicians and their lawyers by the appellate and Supreme Courts, have yet to abate the obnoxious situation in the judiciary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022President says with digital currency, GDP will rise by $29bn in 10 years\n\n\u2022Nigeria first country to launch electronic money in Africa\n\n\u2022Emefiele: new intervention will jumpstart productive base of economy \u2022Reiterates Nigeria cannot fritter FX on cheap imports, currency speculators\n\nDeji Elumoye, James Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja\n\nIn line with efforts to enhance the payment system and boost transactions, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), also known as eNaira, in Abuja. This was as Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, unveiled a new financial instrument tagged, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d meant to stimulate activities in private sector companies in the country that would be selected.\n\nBuhari said during the launch of the digital currency that with the introduction of eNaira, the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was projected to rise by $29 billion in the next 10 years. He stressed that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nThe president assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC. He disclosed that the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began in 2017.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System.\u201d\n\nThe president also explained why he supported the initiative, saying in recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline.\n\nThe decline was exacerbated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new digital economy, stressed.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that central banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u2018private currencies\u2019 that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of central banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payment.\n\n\u201cA handful of countries, including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia, have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of central banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 per cent were experimenting with the technology, and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe president also said CBN\u2019s reputation as a leading innovator, \u201cin the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions,\u201d inspired him to approve eNaira.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank had invested heavily in creating a payment system that was ranked in the top 10 in the world and, certainly, the best in Africa.\n\nBuhari explained, \u201cThis payment system now provides high-value and time-critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have also supported several private-sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said with the new initiative, CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinise and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from November 1. Under the initiative, the CBN governor said, a new set of 100 companies would be rolled out every 100 days and their names would be published in the national dailies for Nigerians to see and confirm.\n\nHe said the new initiative would be managed by the CBN Development Finance Department, under his direct supervision.\n\nThe CBN governor pointed out that the initiative would be the best and most sustainable way to strengthen the value of the naira, insisting that what the country requires is production and more production.\n\nEmefiele explained, \u201cWorking through banks, the financial instrument will be available to their customers in critical areas to boost the production and productivity, and to immediately transform and jumpstart the productive base of the economy.\n\n\u201cAfter these 100 projects by companies in the first 100 days from November 1, we will take the next 100 companies/projects for another 100 days beginning February 1, 2022, and then another 100 companies for another 100 days beginning from May 1, 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the instrument was part of measures to reverse the country\u2019s overreliance on imports, adding that the country cannot afford to waste its reserves on cheap imports and currency speculators.\n\nEmefiele also assured that there was no cause for alarm over foreign exchange (FX) availability in the country, pointing out that the country\u2019s FX reserves are strong and, \u201cindeed, getting stronger by the day, crossing the $40 billion mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\u201d\n\nOn the bank\u2019s latest intervention to support companies, the CBN governor said, \u201cWe believe that if we target and support the right companies and projects, we will see a significant, measurable and verifiable increase in local production and productivity, reduction in certain imports, increase in non-oil exports, and improvements in the FX-generating capacity of the economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the current challenges with the country\u2019s exchange rate started since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market. He said the local currency had been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\nHe said about 35 years later, Nigeria had not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201cInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which have wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele queried, \u201cWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation, such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must return to massive home-made production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor said the country must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201cIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery \u2013 we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\u201d\n\nHe said the 100 PPP policy was in addition to other policies and interventions of the CBN meant to support the economy, especially, through the trying times of COVID-19.\n\nEmefiele said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017. He said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and the fast growing payment platforms.\n\nCBN decided to implement its own CBDC and to name the digital currency eNaira, with the expectation that the innovation would make significant positive difference to Nigeria and Nigerians, he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the eNaira would support a resilient payment ecosystem, encourage rapid financial inclusion, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens and increase revenue and tax collection.\n\nHe said eNaira would also facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions, and improve the efficiency of payments.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira \u2013 like the physical naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at one naira to one eNaira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said in a bid to further de-risk the process, CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payment and financial architecture and designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems. He said the bank had also implemented safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN boss added that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nHe said since the eNaira platform went live, there had been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and others across the world, with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nAccording to him, 33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform while N500 million had been successfully minted by the central bank, including N200 million, which had been issued to financial institutions.\n\nEmefiele said over 2,000 customers have been on-boarded while120 merchants had successfully registered on the eNaira platform.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, customers who download the eNaira Speed Wallet App will be able to perform the following: Onboard and create their wallet, fund their eNaira wallet from their bank account, transfer eNaira from their wallet to another wallet, and make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations.\u201d\n\nEmefiele acknowledged there was a continuing debate on the true value of the naira, adding, \u201crather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyse how we got here, in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN staff that worked tirelessly to deliver on the central bank\u2019s numerous projects.\n\nSpeaking further in an interview with THISDAY, Emefiele said, \u201cWe would not embark on a project where we have not really dimensioned the risks; you identify risks and you now measure the risks and then we think about how to manage the risks and we have looked at it.\n\n\u201cThere is no need, absolutely no reason for anybody to be afraid of the risk of even hacking your account and the rest of that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis morning I set up my account and my account is operating very well. I talked about the BVN; the BVN is one of the best payment systems infrastructure that we have put in place and I can assure you that with all that has been done, you cannot hack into it.\n\n\u201cIf somebody hacks into yours, it will be because you were reckless in handling your information but not that the system failed.\u201d\n\nHe described eNaira as an extension of the payment system in Nigeria, which would enhance payments outside the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou can make payment for goods and services rendered to somebody who even resides outside the country as long as he is willing to accept Naira.\n\n\u201cWe will see eventually that what it does is that your reliance on third currency would be reduced by embracing eNaira. That is one area that I am looking forward to, how this would help our country.\u201d\n\nCBN Waives Charges on eNaira Transactions for 90 Days\n\nCBN yesterday said charges for transactions that originate from its eNaira platform would be free from charges for the first 90 days, commencing October 25. The bank noted that it would, thereafter, revert to applicable charges as outlined in the Guide to Charges by Banks, Other Financial and Non-bank Financial Institutions.\n\nThis was revealed in a circular on the Regulatory Guidelines on the eNaira, dated October 25, 2021, which was signed by the apex bank\u2019s Director, Financial Policy and Regulations Department, Chibuzo Efobi, and addressed to all stakeholders.\n\nCBN restated in the circular that the digital currency would complement cash as a less costly, more efficient, generally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment and store of value.\n\nIt added that the eNaira would also improve monetary policy effectiveness, enhance government\u2019s capacity to deoy targeted social interventions, provide alternative less costly channels for collection of government revenue and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the guidelines further seek to provide simplicity in the operation of the eNaira, encourage general acceptability and use, promote low cost of transactions, drive financial inclusion, while minimising inherent risks of disintermediation or any negative impact of the system.\n\nThe eNaira wallet is required to access, use and hold eNaira, which will be exchangeable for other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC).\n\nThe CBN added that the AML/CFT checks for fraud prevention and detection would apply on the eNaira platform.\n\nHence, financial institutions are required to comply with the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended), the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 (as amended) and all subsisting anti-money laundering laws and regulations as may be issued by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUnder the new system, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) may receive revenue in eNaira; and make payments in same form.\n\nIt added that users of the eNaira would be introduced to a tiered structure with transaction and balance limits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I have checked the spam folder and nothing yet. Easy registration process.\"\n\nAnother user, Oscar Alexander, who gave it one star rating, noted, \u201cI tried registering the first time. Told me there was no email attached to my BVN. I tried my other bank account. It told me an invalid account number. Lol. Now it says too many attempts with the same BVN. What a joke!\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single attempt to get registered on the platform seems futile. It kept giving a prompt invalid BVN whereas my BVN is valid,\" another user had said before the app was taken down.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that majority of the users gave the app one star. It is not clear whether the app was removed due to the poor rating it suffered or if the CBN had done that itself.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, in a conference at the beginning of the month, promised that the country would start digital Naira currency.\n\nEmefiele said the eNaira would operate as a wallet through which customers could hold existing funds in their bank accounts, and that this would accelerate financial inclusion and enable cheaper and faster remittance inflows.",

          "text": "The recently launched eNaira Wallet application has been removed from Google Play Store barely 36 hours after it was launched by the Central Bank of Nigeria, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nHowever, the app is currently available on the Apple app store with 2.6 over 5 ratings.\n\nThe digital currency has two applications, which are eNaira speed wallet and eNaira merchant wallet.\n\nOn Monday, the two apps were rolled out on the Google play store and the Apple store.\n\nThe eNaira was developed by the fintech company, Bitt, which was also responsible for the creation of CBDC in some East Caribbean countries.\n\nAt the launch on Monday, the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele, boasted that 500 million eNaira ($1.21 million) has already been minted.\n\nMeanwhile, a notice on the eNaira website explained how the currency and the wallet would work.\n\nIt read: \u201cGet Ready With Your Accurate BVN Data For Your Hitch-Free Enrolment.\n\n\u201cTo sign-up on the eNaira speed wallet, you would be required to input the following details exactly as captured during your BVN enrollment.\n\n\u201cFirst Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, State of Origin, and Email.\n\n\u201cYour banks are waiting to assist you in validating and updating your BVN details to ensure seamless enrolment to the eNaira platform.\u201d\n\nHowever, negative reactions have trailed the launch of the app as many users complained of several issues, ranging from the inability to link their Bank Verification number, to getting a verification email.\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters as of Wednesday afternoon showed that the app had only gained 1.9 stars out of 5 stars preview.\n\n\n\nAlso, in the review section, many Nigerians expressed their displeasure.\n\nA user, Moyosore Fagbemigun, despite giving four stars, wrote: \u201dAfter sign up, I did not get the verification email in my BVN linked email. I have checked the spam folder and nothing yet. Easy registration process.\"\n\nAnother user, Oscar Alexander, who gave it one star rating, noted, \u201cI tried registering the first time. Told me there was no email attached to my BVN. I tried my other bank account. It told me an invalid account number. Lol. Now it says too many attempts with the same BVN. What a joke!\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single attempt to get registered on the platform seems futile. It kept giving a prompt invalid BVN whereas my BVN is valid,\" another user had said before the app was taken down.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that majority of the users gave the app one star. It is not clear whether the app was removed due to the poor rating it suffered or if the CBN had done that itself.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, in a conference at the beginning of the month, promised that the country would start digital Naira currency.\n\nEmefiele said the eNaira would operate as a wallet through which customers could hold existing funds in their bank accounts, and that this would accelerate financial inclusion and enable cheaper and faster remittance inflows.",

          "title": "Building a food supply operating system: the Vendease story",
          "text": "Vendease was founded in January 2020 by four friends: Tunde Kara (CEO), Olumide Fayankin (COO), Gatumi Aliyu (CPO) and Wale Oyepeju (CTO), to solve Africa\u2019s food supply chain problems by digitising procurement processes, storage operations and logistics, and offering flexible payment systems to help food businesses grow.\n\nThere are a lot of fragmented moving parts in running procurement for businesses in Africa, especially small food businesses. Food businesses are mostly vulnerable to substandard goods, fluctuating pricing system, expensive middlemen, wastage of productive time while restocking, and unreliable logistics.\n\nNow, instead of going through the inefficient route of restocking food materials, restaurants can click to order and get all their food supplies within 24 hours on Vendease.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBuilding Vendease\n\nBefore Vendease, the co-founders, who have been friends for over six years, had forayed into different businesses together. They had even founded an adtech company that wanted to put ad screens in public buses and ride hailing cabs, but the business didn\u2019t scale.\n\nWhile growing up, Kara, ex-CEO of RED Media and Fayankin, ex-COO at Statecraft Inc., were actively involved in small-scale trading and procurement. Kara grew up on his civil servant father\u2019s farm where they reared animals and grew crops, but the farm later folded up due to lack of access to the market.\n\nBefore leaving for university\u2014and afterwards, occasionally during the holidays\u2014Fayakin handled procurement for his family\u2019s hotel business in Akure. Though Kara would go on to do different things after school and Olumide would become a procurement expert, having these early experiences from different perspectives was key to how they were able to quickly connect the dots when they came together to start Vendease.\n\nKara, who considers himself a foodie\u2014somebody who loves to eat\u2014had a light bulb moment when a food truck that sold \u201cone of the best pork chops in the world\u201d in the Lekki area of Lagos shut down due to its inability to cope with the price instability of food materials in Nigeria. The business was running at a loss and the owner told Kara he had to shut down.\n\nVendease co-founders.\n\nKara told his friends about the closure of his best pork chops spot. They all vented and, as usual, discussed the problem for a while, asking what if they could do something to help small food businesses like this to scale. But they soon forgot about it and went on with their lives.\n\nThe eureka moment that would lead to Vandease came when Fayankin and his wife won an online couple\u2019s competition that sent them on an all-expense-paid getaway in one of the finest hotels in Lagos. While in the hotel, Fayakin overheard the manager of the hotel lamenting about the late delivery of items he had ordered for about two days. He engaged the manager and carefully registered all his troubles. He then asked the manager if he\u2019d take an alternative if he saw one. The manager said yes and that\u2019s how Vendease, which hadn\u2019t been named, got its first customer.\n\n\u201cWe stopped after the third successful errand. While running errands for this hotel, on the side, we were talking to other food business owners and learning a lot from the open market, and then we decided to build technology stacks that would help solve the problem at scale,\u201d Kara told TechCabal.\n\nThey reached out to Gatumi who was then CPO at 54gene, Africa\u2019s premier biotech company, and Oyepeju who was a serial techpreneur and has built technologies for a few global tech companies like IBM and MTN.\n\n\u201cWe put a thesis together after a couple of months and analysed what the market size was, and what our market share would be if we were to kick off then. We took our thesis to local angels in the Lagos ecosystem and they gave us our first cheque to prove the business model based on our track records,\u201d Kara said.\n\nPivoting into a more sustainable system\n\nThe initial idea was simple: enable food businesses to get their regular supply at the quality and price they wanted. So they built a marketplace to connect restaurants with manufacturers, vendors and farms. This way, restaurants could compare prices and buy according to their budget.\n\nThey entered the market with this product and, after a while, realised that they\u2019d only digitised the traditional way of procurement. Their customers\u2019 complaints on delayed fulfilment and poor quality still lurked around. So they started building proprietary tech and systems that would allow them to be active in the entire value chain, from the point of order to the point of last-mile fulfilment.\n\nSo how does a food supply operating system work?\n\nVendease doesn\u2019t just allow food businesses place orders for food supplies and track them; they can also manage inventory, track expenses and gain access to credit facilities. The startup is moving towards becoming the only partner food businesses need to scale and stay in business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAccording to Kara, the company has grown from a procurement marketplace to a full-fledged data company. In the space of 22 months of operations, the company has built a data bank that now gives near-perfect insights on how to serve their customers better.\n\n\u201cWe now have an algorithm that can predict when and what our users are going to order. So we have our trained procurement officers on standby before our customers even make their orders. We can move ahead, and this is how we\u2019ve been able to beat the 24 hours delivery time,\u201d Kara said when asked how the company fulfils a promise of 24 hours delivery in a busy environment like Lagos.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nThe startup is growing fast from a one-customer business to handling procurement for over a thousand food businesses in three Nigeria cities: Lagos, Ibadan and Abuja.\n\nBecause its algorithm was built on a tough market like Lagos, expanding and operating in Ibadan and Abuja was seamless.\n\nIn September 2021 alone, the startup said it has delivered approximately 100,000 metric tons of food and helped restaurants save approximately 5,000 man-hours in the last 9 months. This has helped the startup to hit a $12.9 million transaction volume in September.\n\nThe startup joined Y Combinator in the summer of 2020 and on Monday, October 25, it announced that it has closed a $3.2 million investment round from Global Founders Capital, Y Combinator, Hustle Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Hack VC, Soma Capital. Early backers like Tayo Oviosu of Paga, John Obaro of Remita and Magic fund also participated.\n\nSpeaking on their investment in Vendease, Don Stalter, managing partner at Global Founders Capital, said, \u201cAs a backer of one of Africa\u2019s very first unicorns, Jumia, we\u2019ve seen a great deal of talent in the market\u2014and Tunde and the Vendease team are best in class both in EMEA and globally. Their laser focus and rapid growth are unprecedented, and there\u2019s a massive opportunity ahead.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to use the fund to expand into more African cities and build more technology stacks that will position it as the operating system of food supply.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "After two years of operation, DHL Africa is shutting down its pan-African online retail platform, e-Shop, at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer accepting orders and this service will be closed effective October 30th, 2021. All orders in process will be shipped or refunded.

This followed \u201cimpressive growth\u201d in the usage of the Africa eShop app, Hennie Heymans, CEO of DHL Express Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) said at the time. By August of 2019, the platform had been rolled out to 34 countries across SSA.\n\nOnce considered a threat to leading e-commerce players in Africa, DHL\u2019s eShop offered relatively faster delivery compared to its peers but was also one of the most expensive platforms for international shopping, some of its users told TechCabal.\n\nDHL is closing down its Africa eShop. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nHowever, for reasons not stated, eShop has now been delisted from mobile application stores and some features on the platform have been disabled as DHL moves to shut down the service on October 30.\n\nIt is not immediately clear if the company is closing its eShop operations in other regions too, such as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\n\nTechCabal reached out to DHL Africa for answers but has yet to receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nHi, unfortunately the eShop is closing 30 October.

          "title": "How Koa is helping Kenyans build and manage wealth",
          "text": "Despite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors attributed to this low rate: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also a problem of cumbersome saving options and lack of proper financial education that exposes people to the importance of savings.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Belgium to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delila and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform has already passed a 12,000 users mark and has received a deposit of 11,105,315.30 KES ($100,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; the lack of access to formal financial products also made it hard to invest. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Apple\u2019s second fall event, tagged \u201cApple Unleashed\u201d, happened on Monday October 18 and everybody and their uncles have been talking about the exciting series of updates released at the event.\n\nUnlike its September event that opened with drone-captured California landscapes in the company of live music, this recent event opened in a small garage with instrumental music, composed from a combination of simple sounds from the Mac, AirPods and HomePod.\n\nApple released two new Macbooks: the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) and MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021). The tech company went further to silence its critics with the two biggest surprises of the day: two new M1 chips\u2014the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max\u2014which will power the new MacBooks and promise tremendous performance improvements over the silicon chips in previous MacBooks.\n\nIn a beautiful transition between Tim Cook and Zain Lowe, Apple also revealed the Music Voice Plan, a new subscription category for Apple Music that allows users to seamlessly use Siri with Apple Music.\n\nThe tech giant also introduced AirPods 3 and some new HomePod mini colours.\n\nAnd in a move that looks like a joke but isn\u2019t, Apple wants to sell its users a microfibre cleaning cloth for $19. But that\u2019s Apple doing what it does best.\n\nHere is a detailed list of everything that was announced.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nApple Music subscription plan\n\nApple is undoubtedly bullish on music and how its users experience sounds. The fall event started off with the introduction of Apple Music Voice Plan, a new subscription offering that allows users to seamlessly enjoy Siri with Apple Music.\n\nSiri will now have custom playlists dedicated to various moods and settings and featuring several notable artists. The new Voice Plan will allow subscribers to listen to their favourite music at an affordable price.\n\nThis feature will kick off in 17 countries before expanding to more regions. As you might have guessed, no African countries are included in the kick-off regions.\n\nThe new Voice Plan will begin at just $4.99 a month, which is way lesser than the individual and family plan that are $9.99 and $14.99 respectively.\n\nApple Music plans\n\nNew colours for Apple HomePod Mini Smart Speaker\n\nAesthetics\u2014that\u2019s the simplest way to describe this update. Even though Apple won\u2019t be giving us colour variations in Mac, as demanded by lots of users, it has added new colours to the HomePod. They are now available in orange, yellow and blue.\n\nApple HomePod\n\nAirPods 3\n\nAirpods 3 was one of the most anticipated products on the list, and it was launched with new features. It has the same design as the AirPods Pro and is loaded with spatial audio along with new low-distortion drivers, with sweat and water resistance.\n\nIt has a battery life of over six hours and arrives with MagSafe and wireless charging. The new AirPods selling price starts at $179 and will be available from next week.\n\nM1 Pro And M1 Max Chips\n\nEarlier in this article, we called these updates the two biggest surprises of the night. We didn\u2019t get just one horsepower processor; we got two. Apple is generous and we appreciate that.\n\nThese two processors are like the SSC Tuatara of computer chips; they are, by far, the strongest and fastest processors from Apple\u2014and from any company\u2014to date.\n\nThese two chips power the newly released Mac.\n\nNew 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 MacBook Pros\n\nMacBook Pro\n\nIn our review of iOS 15, we mentioned that Apple is listening to its users now more than ever. And that\u2019s evident in this new update. The new Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Pros, in 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 variations, have a lot of the things people want. Some things they want them to add and some they want them to bring back.\n\nThere are more ports (HDMI and SD card reader), MagSafe charging, real function keys and no-touch bar, along with what they promise is blistering speed with extreme energy efficiency.\n\nThe two devices come with a 1080p camera, studio-quality mics, more powerful sound system, and large beautiful Mini-LED displays. Some critics likened it to a notebook with a superman ability.\n\nThe price starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. The basic models come as standard with the M1 Pro, 16GB of Unified Memory and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch comes with the 10-core CPU instead of the 8-core in the 14-inch.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Apple intentionally released simple iPhone upgrades to lead their competitors on. Intel did their social experiment ads and capitalised on the inefficiency of Apple; then Microsoft had their event boasting about how they have built the best PC in Surface Studios, combining a cool form factor,\u201d Dumebi Iwuchukwu, design lead at Big Cabal Media, and of course an Apple fanboy, said in his unusual slack rants.\n\n\u201cNow Apple has blown them out of the water with better chips. The 64gb video memory is the most futuristic innovation from Apple so far; plus all these happened amidst a global chips shortage.\u201d he reluctantly concluded.\n\nThe prices of the two devices go up as their specs thicken. For instance, there\u2019s an addition of $500 on 14-inch for the M1 Max with 24-core GPU; 32-core GPU adds $700.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: Naira\u2019s digitisation (the eNaira)\n\nA very recent accomplishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is the issuance of the new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the eNaira.\n\nThe eNaira is the digital form of the Naira issued by the CBN to complement the traditional Naira as a less costly and more efficient means of payment, geared towards fostering financial inclusion of the unbanked population.\n\nThe eNaira has been designed to operate using the two-tier model, \u2018a hybrid system\u2019, where the CBN as developer and regulator relates directly with the users, while the commercial banks, including other fintech organisations, act as intermediaries.\n\nConsequently, financial institutions have the responsibility to onboard their customers and integrate the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nAcceptance of the eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf properly harnessed, a more simplified and less costly payment system would thrive in Nigeria. The country is home to one of the world\u2019s youngest populations, with increasing smartphone penetration, and has made notable advancements in regulations to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments.\n\nCertainly, there are challenges to operating a CBDC, one of which is the possibility of deposit flight from traditional commercial banks.\n\nMeasures to combat this concern include limiting the amount of CBDC held by each consumer as already implemented by the CBN and its zero interest rate, thus disincentivising the need to have a high stock of this asset. Regulators should begin to measure the level of acceptance of this digital currency within the next few months.\n\nBeyond Financial Inclusion\n\nA CBDC Regime for Efficiency in the Flow of Foreign Remittances\n\nOne of the major benefits canvassed for the development of the CBDC is the ability to solve the present inefficiencies in the flow of foreign remittances (FR). FR flow continues to be one of the greatest sources of revenue for developing economies such as Nigeria.\n\nThe World Bank data also indicates that remittance flow to Nigeria accounted for over 40% of remittance flows to the sub-Saharan region in 2020, while remaining the most expensive region to send money to.\n\nHow can the adoption of CBDC by central banks aid in solving the inefficiencies in the flow of FR? A major priority of the G20 has been the need to enhance cross-border payments by addressing the key challenges.\n\nVarious research efforts aimed at addressing these challenges indicate that by leveraging on technological advancement, a model like the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) solution for cross border funds transfer has the potential to complete a multi-currency cross-border payment process utilising wholesale multi-CBDCs (mCBDCs) within seconds.\n\nTo achieve these gains, it is imperative to factor an international dimension into the CBDC\u2019s design. This would require multi-jurisdictional collaboration amongst central banks, which takes interoperability across jurisdictions into account when countries are designing their domestic CBDCs. It is hoped that the design model behind the eNaira can permit coordination amongst peers once mCBDCs models become operational.\n\nBoosting Intra-African Trade by Digitising Trade Finance: A case for mCBDCs\n\nBeyond the tremendous potential for efficiency in the flow of FR, mCBDCs may provide a great avenue for boosting intra-African trade through a unified payment system for cross-border trade in goods and services within the African Continental Free Trade Area (\u201cAfCFTA\u201d).\n\nThe AfCFTA, once fully operational, promises to unlock immense value and economic development for the continent. Blockchain technology is delivering great rewards, which the continent has to fully embrace to make the quantum leap in economic development, especially after the setback experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs already stated, the DLT solution for cross-border and FX funds transfer has huge potentials for simplifying cross-border payment with great savings on time and money.\n\nResearch already reveals that it can deliver advantages like payment verification decentralisation, resilient payment landscape, payment innovation through utilisation of smart contracts, cash tokenisation, data integrity, and interoperability.\n\nThese are emerging solutions to pain points currently experienced in cross-border transactions, and African entrepreneurs and SMEs will benefit greatly from such a system.\n\nThe DLT solution is not without its problems like other technological innovations, and various jurisdictions are still ironing out the kinks. However, the conversation keeps progressing and Africa through AfCFTA must not be left out of the discourse as the DLT solution promises to be one of the major avenues for eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade within the continent.\n\nAsides from Nigeria, many African countries are actively exploring and researching the issuance of CBDCs in their jurisdictions. We believe that CBDC adoption within the AfCFTA is imminent, albeit progressive.\n\nThus, the importance of early cooperation amongst member states at the design stage, or at the latest, the pilot stage, cannot be overemphasised. If this window is missed, coordination at a later stage becomes cumbersome, time-consuming, expensive, and may set the continent back decades in its economic development agenda.\n\nThe unplanned and undesirable alternative would most likely be a proliferation of largely unregulated cryptocurrencies and their variants as a means of payment across large eCommerce platforms and the likely adoption of global alternatives to money such as the stablecoins, which is already a subject of discourse.\n\nConclusion\n\nNigeria has taken another bold step towards trade finance digitisation by introducing the eNaira; however, the journey has just begun. CBDCs have great potential for unlocking the exponential economic growth of Africa.\n\nSome countries and regional economic blocs are making great strides in developing workable solutions to unlock the value in mCBDCs adoption through partnerships with organisations like the Bank for International Systems (BIS).\n\nIf Africa is to tap into the huge potential for trade liberalisation offered by the AfCFTA, it needs to take a cue from these jurisdictions and explore partnerships for research and development into mCBDCs as a veritable means for cross-border payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAderemi Fagbemi Partner, Tech & Digital Law Desk at Tope Adebayo LLP | +234 809 992 7408 | a.fagbemi@topeadebayollp.com | Website Aderemi is a Partner with Tope Adebayo LLP with almost two decades of experience in the legal profession.

(Un)fortunately, money is a necessary fuel \u2014 read evil \u2014 and taking the well-trodden path of getting funding, you decide to find investors.\n\nWhat should I do? Is a frequently asked question, but I think more people should ask questions like \u201cWhat should I not do?\u201d \u201cWhat is the surest way to fail big time?\u201d *Winks* at the Inversion Mental Model. And with data projecting that nine out of ten startups will fail, these seem like crucial questions to ask.\n\nWe\u2019re here for you. At Techpoint Africa, we have a bi-monthly series titled Angels and VCs. We have frank conversations with investors, asking them questions like determining what startups to invest in and things they think founders should avoid doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess what? We curated some exciting and sound fundraising advice dished out by investors in our conversations with them. Our Reporter, Chimgozirim Nwokoma, has done the legwork.\n\nDig in and enjoy: First time founder?

In a recently announced seed round, Autochek, an Africa-focused automotive tech company, raised $13.1 million. The round was co-led by previous investors, TLcom Capital and 4DX Ventures.\n\nOther returning investors are Enza Capital, Lateral Capital, Golden Palm Investment, and the venture capital arms of Toyota Tsusho Corporation & CFAO Group, ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, respectively.\n\nThis round comes after a $3.4 million pre-seed in November 2020. It will be deployed to improve the platform\u2019s loan financing model for car purchases and boost growth in its recent expansion into C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with Egypt and South Africa in view. But, what does Autochek do?\n\nThe platform leverages technology in providing a way to buy new and fairly-used cars, with an option to pay in instalments.\n\nLaunched in October 2020 and founded by Ikot Ekpe, former Co-founder and CEO of Cars45, Autochek presently operates in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThey have partnerships with 70 African banks, including the United Bank for Africa, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Kenya, with a network of over 1000 auto dealers and over 15000 vehicles on its marketplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoom out: It will not be out of place to connect Autochek\u2019s growth to the various acquisitions it has undertaken in the one year of its existence.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 14, 2020, Autochek announced the acquisition and operational management of Cheki\u2019s Nigeria and Ghana arm. Cheki is an online marketplace for automobiles. And on Tuesday, September 7, 2021, Autochek announced acquiring Cheki\u2019s Kenya and Uganda arm for an undisclosed price.\n\nGoing forward: The company aims to address the issue of credit penetration in auto markets by increasing access to auto financing for consumers across Africa with a simplified digital-first financing process.\n\nAnother smart address verification tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it just me? Living in Nigeria, you most likely have faced the challenge of describing unnamed turns that e-maps can\u2019t accurately capture to a delivery agent or a guest unfamiliar with your area. If yes, then you\u2019ve experienced firsthand the impact of a poor addressing system.\n\nRemember this? Inside the deep challenges of eCommerce and logistics in Nigeria\n\nThis issue affects not just delivery companies but Know Your Customer services for everyday businesses and individuals. How, for instance, do you verify the address of prospective clients or domestic staff? Smart address verification tools like Plus Codes, OkHi, and VeriFind, have been created to solve this challenge.\n\nIn July 2021, Nigerian Identity verification company, VerifyMe launched VeriFind, a geotagging solution to enhance verifying addresses.\n\nVeriFind\u2019s AI-based Geographic Information System (GIS) works with data pooled from a verification logistics network of over 25,000 physical agents in Nigeria. In this way, it identifies unnamed streets and corners.\n\nThe platform promises a faster experience as its technology enables real-time prescreening of addresses using GPS. In four months, it claims to have recorded 200,000 address verifications and over 600,000 GIS checks from its smartphone users. Also, customers can build their verification model with VeriFind\u2019s Software Development Kit.\n\nThinking out loud: One cannot help but wonder how effective this verification solution would be in actively tackling the issue of poor addressing systems for very remote areas. Although, with VeriFind\u2019s technology backed by over 20,000 last mile address verification agents, its remote reach is highly probable.\n\nYou can now bill friends and loved ones with Paystack\u2019s Pay for Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? African payment company, Paystack, has launched Pay for Me, a new feature that lets you shop on Paystack\u2019s and Product Link\u2019s storefront and have the bills paid by someone else of your choosing. I envision forwarding bills to rich aunties and uncles; sounds good if you ask me.\n\nBut how does it work? Let\u2019s say I want to use the Pay for Me feature to buy a bag on Paystack\u2019s storefront. I\u2019ll add the bag to my cart and fill in the necessary details at the checkout point. But, instead of selecting the \u201creview and pay\u201d option, I\u2019ll use the \u201cLet someone pay for you\u201d option.\n\nThis generates a link that you can share, even on social media. This service is available in Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nAre my details safe? I know you care about your privacy, so does Paystack. When you send a Pay for Me link to someone, they only see your name and the product details. Information like your delivery address is not shown. Also, the buyer\u2019s details are protected; only their names and email address will reflect.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning a startup is hard. Not only do you have to come up with a good idea, but you also have to get customers, hire employees, manage your finances, and in this age of venture capital funding, get people to invest in your startup.\n\nOn their own, these are challenging tasks for anyone, but for a first-time founder with little or no experience, it can be overwhelming. As a result, we\u2019ve written this article to help you on your fundraising journey. Most investors \u2014 whether angel investors or traditional VC firms \u2014 receive several pitches daily from entrepreneurs looking to get funded. Therefore, you need to make it easier for them to consider you.\n\nTwice a month, we speak to angel investors and venture capitalists who have invested in African startups to get a peek into what they consider when deciding to invest in startups. So far, we\u2019ve spoken to Idris Bello, one of Andela\u2019s early investors, Maya Horgan Famodu, the Founder of Ingressive Capital, and Dayo Koleowo, partner at Microtraction.\n\nBefore we continue, it\u2019s important to note that the fundraising process often depends on what startup funding stage you\u2019re at. For this article, we\u2019ve focused on raising your first round of funding, usually in the first few months of operation.\n\nDetermine what type of investor you need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of money coming into the African tech ecosystem, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should attempt to bring every investor in on your cap table. For example, you don\u2019t need to apply to Y Combinator because everyone you know is applying; that\u2019s the wrong approach to take. You need to determine what kind of investor you want on your journey.\n\nThe relationship between investors and the startups/founders they invest in is almost similar to a marriage; you can\u2019t afford to get it wrong, or you may regret it. Investors often have criteria that they look out for, and you should also. For example, most people investing in Africa describe themselves as sector-agnostic. That may change as the ecosystem develops, but you need to ensure that your interest aligns with theirs.\n\nEarly stage venture firm, Microtraction, has a thing for fintechs. According to Koleowo, \u201cThere were just a lot of problems around financial services on the continent, and specifically in Nigeria. And thanks to companies like Paystack and Flutterwave, a lot of people built on top of that. And so, you find different founders trying to solve specific niches of the financial services, which I believe will continue because there are still aspects of financial services that need solutions.\u201d\n\nAngel investor, Yemi Keri could show interest if you have the kind of target audience she likes.

          "text": "Investors overlooked lower interest rates on the one-year Nigerian Treasury Bill at Wednesday\u2019s primary market auction, attempting to invest three times the amount that was up for sale.\n\nNigeria planned to borrow N140.8 billion from investors but received a total offer of N423.8 billion, three times the amount that was initially offered.\n\nThe strong demand was despite the government offering a lower interest rate compared to the last auction.\n\nThe stop rate at the auction was 6.99 percent compared to 7.25 percent at the previous auction.\n\nRiding on investor appetite, the government ended up raising N230.3 billion in one-year T-Bills, N89.5 billion more than its initial offer.\n\nThe extra cash raised from the one-year bill more than made up for the lower than planned outturn of the 91-day and 182-day T-bills where the government raised N2.6 billion and N2.0 billion respectively as against the N3.1 billion and N6 billion initially planned.\n\nRead Also: Investors expect lower returns ahead today\u2019s T-bill auction\n\nThe government offered lower interest rates to investors because demand outweighed supply at a time when there\u2019s high liquidity in the system and there\u2019s too much money chasing few investment options.\n\nInvestors had expected lower interest rates at Wednesday\u2019s auction even though they would have wished for better returns to compensate for high inflation.\n\nThe problem with settling for lower returns however is that it further widens the country\u2019s negative real return on investment.\n\nInflation cooled for the sixth straight month in September to 16.63 percent but the pace of deceleration is not happening fast enough for investors who must manage a negative real return on their investment.\n\nAt 6.9 percent, the return on the one-year Treasury Bill leaves investors with a negative real return of -9.73 percent from 9.28 percent prior to the auction.\n\nGhana, for instance, has a real rate of return of around 6 percent.\n\nThe Nigerian government is keen to keep interest rates low in order to manage its ballooning debt service cost which was 72 percent of revenues in 2020, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nWhile the country will benefit from lower debt service costs, it also runs the risk of losing investors to other markets with real returns on investment.",

          "text": "Tunde Hassan-Odukale, through direct and indirect shares, built a majority shareholding in FBN Holdings plc (FBNH), to gain controlling stake in the financial holding company this year, according to data analysed by BusinessDay.\n\nThe indirect shares in FBNH are owned through entities like Leadway Assurance and its related companies. Leadway Assurance the privately-held and largest insurance company in Nigeria is owned and run by Tunde Hassan-Odukale.\n\nBusinessDay discovered that Hassan-Odukale acquired the bulk of his shareholding in the bank this year.\n\nThe Hassan-Odukale family have held shares in Nigeria\u2019s oldest bank for over 20 years said a person familiar with the family business.\n\nHassan-Odukale\u2019s recent direct and indirect stake in FBN Holdings Plc shows he has been buying the shares of the financial holding company aggressively this year.\n\nAn analysis of First Bank\u2019s annual report shows that Hassan-Odukale\u2019s direct stake in FBN Holdings was 8,854,003 units while his indirect stake was 360,961,091 units as at the end of 2020.\n\nAs at October 26, Hassan-Odukale\u2019s direct interest in the bank is 26,231,887 units while entities he controls indirectly own 1,897,280,212 units in the financial holding company.\n\nRead Also: Femi Otedola buys 5.07% stake in FBN Holdings\n\nA letter from First Bank to the Nigerian Exchange Group on Tuesday, showed that Hassan-Odukale and entities he controls are the largest shareholder in the bank, when combined. Hassan-Odukale and his related parties own 4.16 percent and 1.20 percent of FBNH, respectively, according to the letter.\n\nData gleaned from the letter show that the direct and indirect shares of Hassan-Odukale in the bank now total 1.9 billion units. This a significant jump from the 369.8 million shares held at the end of 2020, according to data from the 2020 annual report of First Bank.\n\nIn other words Hassan-Odukale, directly or indirectly, acquired 1.5 billion First Bank shares in 2021 alone, 78 percent of the stake related to him.\n\nPut together, all the shares linked to Hassan-Odukale bring his stake equivalent to 5.36 percent of First Bank\u2019s total outstanding shares and makes him the single largest shareholder. Ahead of billionaire investor, Femi Otedola who owns about 1.8 billion shares or 5.07 percent. This contradicts earlier reports that Otedola is the largest shareholder.\n\nSection 120 of Companies and Allied Matters (CAMA) \u201cprovides that a person is a substantial shareholder in a public company if he holds himself or by his nominee, shares in the company which entitle him to exercise at least 5 percent of the unrestricted voting rights at any general meeting of the company.\u201d\n\nSince insurance companies are in the business asset liability management whereby they look for liquid assets to match the risks they insure, it\u2019s no surprise the Hassan-Odukale\u2019s built up their stakes in FBN Holdings said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThrough Leadway Assurance Company Limited, Hassan-Odukale indirectly holds 755,959,459units or 2.11percent. Also, through ZPC/Leadway Assurance Prem & Invent Coll Account he owns 486,605,478 shares of FBN Holding or 1.36 percent.\n\nHis indirect holding through Haskal Holdings Limited is 13,229,148 units or 0.04percent; while his indirect holding through Leadway Capital &Trust Limited is 1,004,528 units.\n\nAlso, indirectly through LAC Investments Limited, Hassan-Odukale holds 112,552 units of FBN Holdings; through Leadway Properties & Investment Limited (112,237 units); indirectly through Leadway Holdings (Holdco), Hassan-Odukale holds 211,290,798 units of FBN Holdings shares or 0.59percent; through OHO Investment (53,771,413 units or 0.15percent); and through Leadway Pensure PFA, Hassan-Odukale owns 375,194,599 or 1.05percent in FBN Holdings.\n\nFBN Holdings Plc recently received notification from APT Securities and Funds Limited that their Client, Otedola and his nominee, Calvados Global Services Limited have acquired a total of 1,818,551,625 units of shares from the Company\u2019s issued share capital of 35,895,292,791.\n\nOtedola\u2019s direct holding is 10 million units while indirect holding through Calvados Global Services Limited is 1.808billionunits. Based on the foregoing, the equity stake of Otedola Olufemi Peter and his nominee in the Company is now 5.07percent.\n\nCalvados Global Services Limited was registered on March 7, 2017 as a private company limited by shares with Business address: 13, Walter Carrinton Crescent, Victoria Island. A check at the Corporate Affair Commission (CAC) shows those behind Calvados Global Services Limited \u2013namely Ola Otedola, Femi Otedola, Temi Otedola, and Ife Otedola.\n\nThe shares of FBN Holdings have seen a remarkable rally lately, making it the best performing banking stock.\n\nIncreased buy-side activities in the stock have continued to increase, pushing the Holdco\u2019s stock price up by over 70 percent this year. Despite a recent dip to N11.65 per share on Wednesday October 27, the stock price still nears its record 52-week high of N12.9 as many investors position in line with some analysts\u2019 recommendations.\n\nFor instance, GTI Research analysts in this week\u2019s recommendation asked investors to \u201cBUY\u201d FBH Holdings shares, saying that the upside potential of the stock over the next 12-months is significantly high when the current price is compared to the analyst\u2019s fair value. GTI has set a target price (TP) of N15.20 for FBN Holdings, which represents an upside potential of 24.08percent.\n\nFBN Holdings has outstanding shares of 35,895,292,792 units valued at N418.180 billion as at Wednesday October 27.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s excessive borrowing could spark fresh agitation after it emerged that Africa\u2019s largest oil producer could spend more on fuel and power subsidies this year than it raised through a Eurobond offering last month.\n\nKeeping gasoline cheap during the first eight months of 2021 cost the West African nation 904 billion naira ($2.2 billion), according to data from the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.\n\nWith the price of crude surging, that figure could surpass 1.5 trillion naira by the end of the year according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nOn top of that, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration is on track to spend an additional 300 billion naira over the course of the year to maintain power tariffs that don\u2019t reflect the cost of producing and distributing electricity, Ben Akabueze, director-general of Nigeria\u2019s budget office, said on Tuesday.\n\nCombined, the interventions would surpass the $4 billion the government raised through a Eurobond in September.\n\nRead Also: World Bank condemns Nigeria\u2019s spending on petrol subsidy\n\nThe subsidies are depriving the cash-strapped nation of much needed revenue at a time when servicing debt is consuming about 70% of government income \u2014 more than the $3.8 billion budgeted for health and education in 2021.\n\nBuhari has shelved plans announced last March to eliminate the costly fuel subsidies. While senior government officials acknowledge the need to phase them out, doing so is politically risky \u2014 especially with elections on the horizon in early 2023.\n\nMany Nigerians regard affordable gasoline as their single dependable benefit from the country\u2019s misspent oil wealth.\n\nGasoline prices, which at 39 cents a liter are among the cheapest globally, have remained unchanged since December, leaving the NNPC, the country\u2019s sole importer of the fuel, to shoulder growing losses as Brent crude has climbed steadily, reaching $86 a barrel.\n\nIf prices aren\u2019t permitted to rise, fuel subsidies could cost the NNPC almost 3 trillion naira over the next 12 months, Shubham Chaudhuri, the World Bank\u2019s country director for Nigeria, said Monday.\n\nDespite producing about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, Nigeria relies on imports for all its gasoline needs because its state-owned refineries fell into disrepair. A portion of these shipments is smuggled to nearby countries where the product is much more expensive.\n\n\u201cNigeria is subsidizing the entire West African region,\u201d Minister of Power Abubakar Aliyu said on Tuesday.",

Andrew Adaze Emwanta JP, said the healthcare sector under the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration has received a tremendous boost within the last five years.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe goal of the state government is not to outrightly demolish the Central Hospital as currently being canvassed by social media hirelings of the APC in Edo State, but rather to improve the environment in which healthcare will be provided to the good people of Edo State.\u201d\n\nNoting that the COVID-19 pandemic is still very much a challenge to the health sector in Nigeria and the world at large, he added, \u201cFor the purpose of achieving government\u2019s developmental plan in the hospital premises, adequate arrangements are being made to ensure that all Edo people who access care at the Central Hospital are adequately catered for while certain services are been re-located.\n\n\u201cThe accolades we got both locally and globally, as a result of our COVID-19 response between last year and this year is a manifest testimony of the determination of the Edo State Government to continuously walk the talk and give a human face to health care services in the State, irrespective of the toll the pandemic had on the State\u2019s revenue receipts.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner further asserted, \u201cGovernor Obaseki remains committed to progressively improving the state of infrastructure around healthcare delivery in Edo State. On September 19 last year, Edo people gave the Governor a mandate under the Making Edo Great again (MEGA) Manifesto to develop Edo State. The ongoing infrastructural development and institutional reforms within the health sector of the State are clear thematic pillars of the MEGA Manifesto of the Godwin Obaseki-led Administration.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval and provisional accreditation of the programmes of the re-built Edo State School of Nursing/Midwifery by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria, is a clear testament of the Governor\u2019s commitment in walking the talk.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY- The Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), has called on African governments and delegates to the annual United Nations (UN) climate change conference \u201cConference of the Parties\u201d (COP26) taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, from November,\n\n1-12, 2021, to be resolute in their demand for climate change liability and payments for carbon debts by rich countries.\n\nDrawing attention to COP26, a summit to be attended by countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \u2013 a treaty that came into force in 1994, ERA/FoEN\n\nin it\u2019s press statement, stated that in recent times, rich countries showed appreciable effort to address climate change with countries such as the United State of America (USA,) Germany and the United Kingdom taking the lead in renewed pledges to the UNFCCC climate fund to address mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries.\n\nERA/FoEN, nonetheless lamented that efforts by rich countries so far have grossly fallen short of expectations and unlikely to close the gap on limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nPointing to a recent UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report that warned that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 percent each year between 2020 and 2030, a report that warned that the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, Executive Director, ERA/FoEN, Dr Godwin Uyi Ojo, harped on the need for African governments and delegates to address the lack of equity and fairness in addressing climate change impacts.\n\nDr. Ojo, noted that catastrophic events which impact climate change have gone worse due to the Covid-19 pandemic, making countries especially in Africa vulnerable. He stated that given the rate of fiscal responsibility and allocations in addressing climate events in Europe and America and the robust response to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an undeniable dichotomy between the rich and poor countries that betray the lack of equity and fairness in addressing these issues in the developing countries.\n\nReiterating this point, he said,\n\n\u201cAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, climate change impact will continue to be on the rise and with growing intensity hence the need for urgency. Firstly, the pledge to mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020-2025 as funds to addressing climate change actions stands at about 30% and is nowhere near its mark. Therefore, the Earth Summit meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP26) in Glasgow should be a rallying moment for rich counties to step up their commitments and show solidarity by walking the talk and putting their money where their mouth is.\n\n\u201cSecondly, CoP26 provides the opportunity to amplify system change and a transition from carbonized economy and fossil fuels dependence to renewable energy. Developing countries should redouble their stand to demand for a fair, just, and equitable energy transition and the climate finance to address climate change. There is the need to end addiction to fossil fuels, discard the false solution of net zero, and enthrone system change in the modes of production and consumption while plugging the widening gap of social inequalities at national levels and on a global scale.\n\n\u201cCoP26 should not be a process to reinforce energy colonialism on Africa but should liberate the continent\u2019s energy potentials through cleaner technology and finance. Africa with low technology intake should not be taken advantage of or seen as a market expansion opportunism for developed countries\u2019 renewable energy sector that is out-competing to dumping of obsolete technologies and petrol/diesel combustion engines.\n\n\u201cWhile the future ban or elimination of combustion engines production and use in some European countries from 2025 onwards is commendable, it should be clear how these obsolete technologies, cars and combustion engines will be disposed of or recycled. Africa should not be the dumping ground or receptacle for such technologies that could be shipped to it as Greek gifts or forms of development aid. In the words of an activist, \u2018you cannot set fire in my house and sell fire extinguisher to me.\u2019\n\n\u201cThirdly, there is the need for African governments and delegates to demand loudly that greenhouse gas emissions is a financial debt and be resolute in the demand for the immediate payment of the Carbon Debt from the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by rich countries. This debt is part of the transitional justice demands for fairness, compensation and reparation for the monumental harm done to the environment some of which are irreversible.\n\n\u201cAfrican delegates should ensure to speak with one voice to demand transitional justice in the payment of carbon debts currently put at 334 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. According to a recent study, the world\u2019s leading polluters have racked up a US$10 trillion carbon debt for carbon dioxide emissions since 1990. This demand for carbon debt payment is sacrosanct and does not deflect from the US$100 billion commitment for climate actions.\u201d\n\nOjo maintained, \u201cAccording to scientific evidence, rich countries contribution of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere account for 70% inclusive of 20% from the USA, while Africa contributes only 4% of the carbon dioxide. Further, the impact of climate change and Covid-19 pandemic and their impacts on escalating the debt service burden on African states is horrendous. This necessitates the call for debt cancellation for developing countries. Africa should be united to restate that she has been shortchanged and has no debt to pay because on the balance, it owes no debt.\u201d\n\nERA/FoEN commended the United Kingdom (UK) government as host, for taking the decision to end support for fossil fuels sector overseas hence the government will no longer support the development of fossil fuel sector overseas including end to export finance and credits, funding for new crude oil, natural gas and coal projects overseas.\n\n...",

Lulu-Briggs for her contributions to women empowerment.\n\nThe women group described Lulu-Briggs as a successful business leader, a passionate voice and pillar of support for the less privileged and vulnerable persons within and beyond Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta for her contributions to women empowerment in the country.\n\nPresident of AWLA, Efe Etomi, who presented the award at an AWLA Parley held during the annual conference of the Nigerian Bar Association in Port Harcourt, described Dr Lulu-Briggs as a strong advocate for the better understanding and systemic change needed in addressing the appalling travails of women, widows and their children.\n\nThe President of AWLA said the organization was particularly appreciative of the considerable voice and support that Dr. Seinye has lent to issues that affect the voiceless, especially women, in our society \u2013 including on the very outdated but, sadly, widespread obnoxious customs and practices of victimization and ill-treatment of widows.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cDr. Lulu-Briggs\u2019 empathy for the plight of widows has deepened as a result of the very public persecution, harassment and bullying by some members of her family and community that she experienced after the peaceful transition to glory of her husband the High Chief Dr O. B. Lulu-Briggs in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe AWLA president praised Dr Seinye\u2019s foresight and commitment to the fruitful partnership between AWLA and the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe abhorrent treatment Mrs. Lulu-Briggs faced as a widow, despite her social standing, shaped the O. B. Lulu-Briggs\u2019 grant that has enabled AWLA to establish a Widow\u2019s Project which offers free legal services to embattled widows in the pursuit of their rights and the protection of their dignity.\u201d\n\nThe Widows Project was launched on June 24, 2020 to commemorate the United Nations International Widows. Through the project the first-ever 24/7 toll-free number- 0800 00231111- for Nigerian widows in distress was launched under the aegis of the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation grant.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn her response, Dr Lulu-Briggs thanked AWLA and indeed the entire Nigeria Bar Association for the honour done to her, pledging to continue to work with AWLA to ensure that the rights of women and other marginalized groups in the society are upheld.\n\n\u201cYour choice of my person for an award in recognition of my support for AWLA and my role in empowering women through the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation was a heartwarming surprise.\n\n\u201cOur focus has been, and will remain, to uplift, rescue and inspire women, especially vulnerable women like widows and those suffering gender-based or domestic violence, to defeat and prevail over the stereotypical and inhibitive traditions that undermine their bloom to its full potential.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an arduous task to which I have devoted my life and appreciate your kind partnership in achieving. I thank you for your thoughtfulness, commitment and partnership to support women. May we continue to work concertedly and conscientiously for the best of our society,\u201d she said.",

Lulu-Briggs for her contributions to women empowerment.\n\nThe women group described Lulu-Briggs as a successful business leader, a passionate voice and pillar of support for the less privileged and vulnerable persons within and beyond Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta for her contributions to women empowerment in the country.\n\nPresident of AWLA, Efe Etomi, who presented the award at an AWLA Parley held during the annual conference of the Nigerian Bar Association in Port Harcourt, described Dr Lulu-Briggs as a strong advocate for the better understanding and systemic change needed in addressing the appalling travails of women, widows and their children.\n\nThe President of AWLA said the organization was particularly appreciative of the considerable voice and support that Dr. Seinye has lent to issues that affect the voiceless, especially women, in our society \u2013 including on the very outdated but, sadly, widespread obnoxious customs and practices of victimization and ill-treatment of widows.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cDr. Lulu-Briggs\u2019 empathy for the plight of widows has deepened as a result of the very public persecution, harassment and bullying by some members of her family and community that she experienced after the peaceful transition to glory of her husband the High Chief Dr O. B. Lulu-Briggs in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe AWLA president praised Dr Seinye\u2019s foresight and commitment to the fruitful partnership between AWLA and the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe abhorrent treatment Mrs. Lulu-Briggs faced as a widow, despite her social standing, shaped the O. B. Lulu-Briggs\u2019 grant that has enabled AWLA to establish a Widow\u2019s Project which offers free legal services to embattled widows in the pursuit of their rights and the protection of their dignity.\u201d\n\nThe Widows Project was launched on June 24, 2020 to commemorate the United Nations International Widows. Through the project the first-ever 24/7 toll-free number- 0800 00231111- for Nigerian widows in distress was launched under the aegis of the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation grant.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn her response, Dr Lulu-Briggs thanked AWLA and indeed the entire Nigeria Bar Association for the honour done to her, pledging to continue to work with AWLA to ensure that the rights of women and other marginalized groups in the society are upheld.\n\n\u201cYour choice of my person for an award in recognition of my support for AWLA and my role in empowering women through the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation was a heartwarming surprise.\n\n\u201cOur focus has been, and will remain, to uplift, rescue and inspire women, especially vulnerable women like widows and those suffering gender-based or domestic violence, to defeat and prevail over the stereotypical and inhibitive traditions that undermine their bloom to its full potential.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an arduous task to which I have devoted my life and appreciate your kind partnership in achieving. I thank you for your thoughtfulness, commitment and partnership to support women. May we continue to work concertedly and conscientiously for the best of our society,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "That democracy is a game of numbers has never been a subject of debate. It is an obvious fact, both in principle and in practice. In deed, in this universally preferred form of government, the people are rightly the vital engine that powers democratic processes and its actualisation.\n\nTherefore, from this foundational framework, there is no gainsaying that the higher the numbers, the brighter the collective fortunes of groups or individuals that populate a given political party. This, succinctly, is in sync with a popular African adage, \u2018a tree does not make a forest\u2019. Or, perhaps, another that says, \u2018when a collective urinates in a spot, it conjures a foam!\u2019\n\nThese aptly capture the ongoing political and social engineering currently unfolding in Anambra State by the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the November 6, 2021 governorship election draws near. In recent times, the fortunes of the APC in the state, as well as the whole of the South East, have continued to receive unprecedented boost, going by the number and calibre of politicians and supporters that continue to embrace the party in a gale of defections from rival political parties.\n\nThe phenomenon is so befuddling that today, an APC that only a few months ago grappled with monumental challenges of acceptance in Anambra and the South East region in general, is now the beautiful bride, not only recognized by many as a true national party, but one in which they desire to fellowship together. Eureka! the people appear to have, finally, discovered the political vehicle most suitable to launch themselves back into national limelight and secure a more promising future.\n\nPreviously, other opposing parties in the zone had almost succeeded in casting the APC in the ignominious image of an unwanted enemy of the people \u2013 a pariah entity and hater of the Igbo race. Deploying a combination of devious post civil war propaganda and modern rejection rhetorics, it was quite easy setting up the APC, as the author and finisher of whatever ill fate that confronted the Igbo, whether at home or in the diaspora.\n\nFor a people so renown in their republican disposition, this was certainly a new philosophy \u2013 one unbeknownst to them, forged in the furnace of pure partisanship and crave for personal advancement.\n\nWere it not so, how come almost two decades after, the lyrical muezzin, nkea bu nke anyi (this is our own), has refused to be internalised, and accepted as a rallying anthem in the four other Southeast states of Enugu, Abia, Imo and Ebonyi?\n\nBesides Anambra, why has it been difficult to spread and plant this seemingly good seed in any of the aforementioned states?\n\nHow come too, those who promoted the concept, almost to the point of being a religion, upon having a \u2018Damascus\u2019 experience left the orchestra for their choir boys?\n\nIn deed, how comprehensible is it that the new altar boys continue to desecrate the sanctuary, leaving the Prophetess bewildered as the ship irretrievably heads for the rocks?\n\nThe answers to these posers lie in the realisation that it only takes one day of truth to overtake many years of lies.\n\nFor the new political consciousness that has suddenly enveloped our landscape, reversing previously held wrong and unfathomable philosophical notions, the maxim that time and truth exonerate victims of falsehood appear to be at work.\n\nMany have attributed this new lease of life for the APC in the South East to many factors. But could it be a mere coincidence that this drastic reinvention of the party in Anambra, particularly, is taking place since the emergence of Senator Andy Uba, as the governorship candidate of the APC in the state? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nPropelled by his Igwebuike philosophy, Senator Uba\u2019s popular Igbo moniker, which when translated, means: \u2018Strength in numbers,\u2019 the unfolding scenario in Anambra is the product of a well thought out political re-engineering meant to wean the people off a belligerent disposition hitherto unknown to their forebears.\n\nHow come a people famed for their courage in battles, convivial spirit, sense of adventure, voyages, good neighbourliness, technical competences and creative ingenuity in the face of challenges and difficulties now be the very ones to seek answers in ethnic cocoons? Tufiakwa!\n\nPut succinctly, Igwebuike means democracy! Simpliciter! And Senator Uba is not only leading the charge, he lives the full expression of the tag in his efforts to build the APC into a formidable force in Anambra State. He is strategic and deliberate in feeding the fuel of unison and purpose to the vehicle of collective progress and betterment of ndi Anambra and Ndi Igbo in general by widening the doors and coast of the party in the state.\n\nAnd rather than a desperate, selfish quest to be a lone hugger of the podium, Igwebuike is deploying positive energy to ensure that he attracts quality ndi Anambra, with remarkable leadership, organizational and governance skills, to the APC fold. This, to me, is a commendable leadership and social engineering foresight for the good of Anambra and its precious people. He appreciates the fact that no one knows it all, but in togetherness, a winning team of leaders that would put the interest of the people first, will emerge.\n\nThe APC as a brand is benefiting from Senator Andy Uba\u2019s Igwebuike \u2018live and let\u2019s live\u2019 political ideology. And the harvest is vividly outstanding, both in quality and quantity.\n\nThe obvious sting of \u2018how did we get here\u2019 tormenting the hearts of leaders and faithful of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), by the defection to the APC and subsequent reception of Dr. Nkem Okeke, deputy governor of Anambra State, by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, is not lost on political observers. Essentially, it underscores not only the current pleasant allure of the party in the state, but also the swift and steady movement on the pathway to victory.\n\nIt is on record, however, that before this stunning development, APC had also attracted several top politicians, including serving and past Senators, past and current House of Representatives members, serving and former state legislators and many others from prominent political parties. And we say, Igwebuike!\n\nOnly few days ago, the deputy governorship candidate of the Accord Party in the coming November 6 election, Chief Kenneth Obi, also got enthralled by the APC alurring populist dispositions and dumped his party to join in the spirit of Igwebuike ( Strength in numbers), in the overall interest of Anambra State!\n\nAnd since democracy is a game of numbers, we are cocksure that with the ceaseless influx of new members and the expected impact of grassroots mobilisation and realignments, APC and ndi Anambra will on November 6, 2021, and beyond, echo a resounding Igwebuike! Surely, Igwebuike wins and wins again. Like in 2007, he will win again in a landslide swell!\n\n\u2022 Hon. Ogene, a former member and deputy chairman, Committee on Media and Public Affairs of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives, is the Director, Media and Publicity, Senator Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation (SAUGCO).",

In recent times, the fortunes of the APC in the state, as well as the whole of the South East, have continued to receive unprecedented boost, going by the number and calibre of politicians and supporters that continue to embrace the party in a gale of defections from rival political parties.\n\nThe phenomenon is so befuddling that today, an APC that only a few months ago grappled with monumental challenges of acceptance in Anambra and the South East region in general, is now the beautiful bride, not only recognized by many as a true national party, but one in which they desire to fellowship together. Eureka! the people appear to have, finally, discovered the political vehicle most suitable to launch themselves back into national limelight and secure a more promising future.\n\nPreviously, other opposing parties in the zone had almost succeeded in casting the APC in the ignominious image of an unwanted enemy of the people \u2013 a pariah entity and hater of the Igbo race. Deploying a combination of devious post civil war propaganda and modern rejection rhetorics, it was quite easy setting up the APC, as the author and finisher of whatever ill fate that confronted the Igbo, whether at home or in the diaspora.\n\nFor a people so renown in their republican disposition, this was certainly a new philosophy \u2013 one unbeknownst to them, forged in the furnace of pure partisanship and crave for personal advancement.\n\nWere it not so, how come almost two decades after, the lyrical muezzin, nkea bu nke anyi (this is our own), has refused to be internalised, and accepted as a rallying anthem in the four other Southeast states of Enugu, Abia, Imo and Ebonyi?\n\nBesides Anambra, why has it been difficult to spread and plant this seemingly good seed in any of the aforementioned states?\n\nHow come too, those who promoted the concept, almost to the point of being a religion, upon having a \u2018Damascus\u2019 experience left the orchestra for their choir boys?\n\nIn deed, how comprehensible is it that the new altar boys continue to desecrate the sanctuary, leaving the Prophetess bewildered as the ship irretrievably heads for the rocks?\n\nThe answers to these posers lie in the realisation that it only takes one day of truth to overtake many years of lies.\n\nFor the new political consciousness that has suddenly enveloped our landscape, reversing previously held wrong and unfathomable philosophical notions, the maxim that time and truth exonerate victims of falsehood appear to be at work.\n\nMany have attributed this new lease of life for the APC in the South East to many factors. But could it be a mere coincidence that this drastic reinvention of the party in Anambra, particularly, is taking place since the emergence of Senator Andy Uba, as the governorship candidate of the APC in the state? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nPropelled by his Igwebuike philosophy, Senator Uba\u2019s popular Igbo moniker, which when translated, means: \u2018Strength in numbers,\u2019 the unfolding scenario in Anambra is the product of a well thought out political re-engineering meant to wean the people off a belligerent disposition hitherto unknown to their forebears.\n\nHow come a people famed for their courage in battles, convivial spirit, sense of adventure, voyages, good neighbourliness, technical competences and creative ingenuity in the face of challenges and difficulties now be the very ones to seek answers in ethnic cocoons? Tufiakwa!\n\nPut succinctly, Igwebuike means democracy! Simpliciter! And Senator Uba is not only leading the charge, he lives the full expression of the tag in his efforts to build the APC into a formidable force in Anambra State. He is strategic and deliberate in feeding the fuel of unison and purpose to the vehicle of collective progress and betterment of ndi Anambra and Ndi Igbo in general by widening the doors and coast of the party in the state.\n\nAnd rather than a desperate, selfish quest to be a lone hugger of the podium, Igwebuike is deploying positive energy to ensure that he attracts quality ndi Anambra, with remarkable leadership, organizational and governance skills, to the APC fold. This, to me, is a commendable leadership and social engineering foresight for the good of Anambra and its precious people. He appreciates the fact that no one knows it all, but in togetherness, a winning team of leaders that would put the interest of the people first, will emerge.\n\nThe APC as a brand is benefiting from Senator Andy Uba\u2019s Igwebuike \u2018live and let\u2019s live\u2019 political ideology. And the harvest is vividly outstanding, both in quality and quantity.\n\nThe obvious sting of \u2018how did we get here\u2019 tormenting the hearts of leaders and faithful of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), by the defection to the APC and subsequent reception of Dr. Nkem Okeke, deputy governor of Anambra State, by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, is not lost on political observers. Essentially, it underscores not only the current pleasant allure of the party in the state, but also the swift and steady movement on the pathway to victory.\n\nIt is on record, however, that before this stunning development, APC had also attracted several top politicians, including serving and past Senators, past and current House of Representatives members, serving and former state legislators and many others from prominent political parties. And we say, Igwebuike!\n\nOnly few days ago, the deputy governorship candidate of the Accord Party in the coming November 6 election, Chief Kenneth Obi, also got enthralled by the APC alurring populist dispositions and dumped his party to join in the spirit of Igwebuike ( Strength in numbers), in the overall interest of Anambra State!\n\nAnd since democracy is a game of numbers, we are cocksure that with the ceaseless influx of new members and the expected impact of grassroots mobilisation and realignments, APC and ndi Anambra will on November 6, 2021, and beyond, echo a resounding Igwebuike! Surely, Igwebuike wins and wins again. Like in 2007, he will win again in a landslide swell!\n\n\u2022 Hon. Ogene, a former member and deputy chairman, Committee on Media and Public Affairs of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives, is the Director, Media and Publicity, Senator Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation (SAUGCO).",
          "summary": "Therefore, from this foundational framework, there is no gainsaying that the higher the numbers, the brighter the collective fortunes of groups or individuals that populate a given political party.\nBesides Anambra, why has it been difficult to spread and plant this seemingly good seed in any of the aforementioned states?\nAnd Senator Uba is not only leading the charge, he lives the full expression of the tag in his efforts to build the APC into a formidable force in Anambra State.\nThis, to me, is a commendable leadership and social engineering foresight for the good of Anambra and its precious people.\nThe APC as a brand is benefiting from Senator Andy Uba\u2019s Igwebuike \u2018live and let\u2019s live\u2019 political ideology.",

          "text": "Nigeria has received a Benin bronze artefact from the University of Cambridge, more than a hundred years after it was taken from the country.\n\nAt a ceremony on Wednesday in the UK, the university handed over the artefact to the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, in a move it earlier described as the \u201cfirst institutional return of its kind.\u201d\n\nJesus College is the first UK institution to hand back a Benin bronze, raising pressure on other establishments, including the British Museum, to follow suit.\n\nThe Nigerian delegation was led by the head of the agency, Professor Abba Tijani, to receive the elaborately carved cockerel, known as \u201cOkukor\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited, very happy to see that this artefact, which has been away from Nigeria for decades, is in good shape,\u201d he said.\n\nTijani, who spoke during the ceremony to hand over the treasure, stated that it was the first time a UK institution would give back a Benin bronze.\n\nHe hailed the college\u2019s act as \u201ca great example for other institutions and other countries\u201d and urged the British Museum to change its stance on the bronzes in its collection.\n\nNoting that Nigeria has handed over a formal request for their repatriation, Tijani insisted that the sculptures \u201care going to the right place and they will be looked after\u201d.\n\nThe bronze was taken from the kingdom of Benin \u2014 now part of Nigeria \u2014 in 1897 when Britain had a foothold on the African continent.\n\nCambridge\u2019s Jesus College removed the cockerel from public display in 2016 after a campaign by students arguing it was a symbol of Britain\u2019s colonial past.\n\n\u2018Now With Its Rightful Owner\u2019\n\nSeveral other western institutions have said they also plan to hand looted African treasures back.\n\nBut the British Museum, which has the world\u2019s largest collection of Benin bronzes, has not done so.\n\nMany are facing mounting pressure to give back colonial-era treasures, thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nNigerian government officials taking part in the ceremony included the Ambassador to the UK, Sarafa Isola, and the brother of the Oba of Benin, Prince Aghatise Erediauwa.\n\n\u201cI thank you for this wonderful initiative. The people of Nigeria are grateful,\u201d said Isola while passing on the thanks of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPrince Erediauwa, on his part, said, \u201cJesus College is indeed challenging the erroneous arguments that stolen art cannot be returned because of the existence of different legal jurisdictions on the matter.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the head of Jesus College, Sonita Alleyne, handed the elaborately carved cockerel to the Nigerian delegation amid cheers and a trumpet fanfare.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be the first institution to simply act,\u201d said Alleyne, hailing a \u201creally historic occasion\u201d as she formally transferred the cockerel\u2019s ownership. \u201cWe are delighted that it is now with its rightful owner.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Quai Branly Museum in Paris is exhibiting a trove of Benin treasures for a final time before they are handed back to Nigeria.\n\nTijani is expected to travel to Scotland to receive another Benin bronze from the University of Aberdeen on Thursday.",

          "text": "The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the reconstruction of 21 roads covering a total distance of 1,804.6 kilometres across the six geo-political zones.\n\nThese projects are to be undertaken by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) through the deployment of its own tax liabilities.\n\nMinister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, announced the approval on Wednesday while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the FEC meeting held in Abuja.\n\nIn July, FEC approved the award of a contract to Dangote Industries for the construction of five roads totalling 274.9 kilometres at the cost of N309.9 billion, advanced by the company as tax credit.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads \u2013 the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto, and a couple of others, and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was about N320 billion,\u201d Fashola said.\n\n\u201cSo today (Wednesday), we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest, but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and commitment to deploy taxes. It\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC.\n\n\u201cSo, NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. Now, the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps the government to achieve many things, including ministerial mandates three and four, which we discussed at the last retreat. ministerial mandates three and four, if you recall, was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course, petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure which is the ministerial mandate four. NNPC has sought and the council has approved today that NNPC deploys tax resources to 21 roads, covering a total distance of 1,804.6 kilometres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North Central, particularly Niger state. The reason is that Niger State is a major storage centre for NNPC. NNPC is doing this to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\u201d\n\nFashola gave an assurance that in the South-West, the Lagos-Badagry Expressway, the Agabara junction, Ibadan to Ilorin (Oyo-Ogbomoso section) will be fixed.\n\nThree other roads are located in the North-East, two in the North-West, and two others in the South-East.\n\nThe Odukpani-Itu-Ikot-Ekpene road, the minister said, has now been fully covered to resolve the problem of financing regarding the execution of the road projects.\n\nSpeaking about the South-East, he stated, \u201cYou have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom States. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuamo, to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cIn the North-West, it is Gada Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau-Gusau-Sokoto road. In the North-East, it is Cham, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road.\u201d\n\nThere will be no more financing problems regarding the execution of roads, said Fashola.",

          "text": "Brazilian senators have voted to recommend charging President Jair Bolsonaro over his handling of the devastating Covid pandemic.\n\nA Senate panel backed a report calling for charges against Mr Bolsonaro including crimes against humanity, after 600,000 deaths from coronavirus.\n\nThe findings will be sent to the chief prosecutor, a Bolsonaro appointee.\n\nThe president has maintained he is \u201cguilty of absolutely nothing\u201d but the crisis has dented his popularity.\n\nBrazil\u2019s death toll is second only to that of the United States.\n\nThere is no guarantee this vote will lead to actual criminal charges, as the report\u2019s recommendations must now be assessed by Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras, who is expected to protect the president.\n\nThe report alleges that Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s government pursued a policy of allowing coronavirus to rip through the country in the hope of achieving herd immunity.\n\nIt describes the president as \u201cthe main person responsible for the errors committed by the federal government during the pandemic\u201d.\n\nThe report\u2019s lead author, centrist Senator Renan Calheiros, called for the panel\u2019s recommendation to charge President Bolsonaro with crimes against humanity to be submitted to the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nBrazil is a party to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, so the international court could take up the case.\n\nBut a referral would only be a first step in a lengthy process in which it would be up to the ICC to determine the merits of the case and whether to take it forward.\n\nIn addition to crimes against humanity, the Senate committee has recommended eight further charges be brought against Mr Bolsonaro in Brazilian courts, including incitement to crime, falsification of documents and the violation of social rights.\n\nMr Bolsonaro is also accused of misusing public funds and spreading fake news about the pandemic.\n\nThe 1,300-page report also recommended bringing charges against two corporations and 77 other people, including three of the president\u2019s adult sons.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Senator Calheiros said that the \u201cchaos of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government will enter history as the lowest level of human destitution\u201d.\n\nThe vote concludes a six-month inquiry which has highlighted scandals and corruption inside the government.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s recommendation is expected to be delivered to the prosecutor-general on Wednesday morning. His office said it would be carefully reviewed as soon as it was received, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThroughout the process, Mr Bolsonaro has insisted that his government \u201cdid the right thing from the first moment\u201d of the pandemic and his allies have been quick to dismiss Tuesday\u2019s recommendations as being driven entirely by \u201cpolitical and electoral\u201d motivations.\n\n\u201cIt is a totally political report, without any legal basis,\u201d said Flavio Bolsonaro, one of the president\u2019s sons accused in the report.\n\n\u201cThe intent of some senators on the investigative committee is to cause the maximum amount of wear and tear on the president.\u201d\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump, a Bolsonaro ally, said in a statement he endorsed the Brazilian president because \u201che fights hard for, and loves, the people of Brazil\u201d.\n\nWednesday marked the end of a long process. Six months of hearings, scandals uncovered, a light shone on a government accused of recklessness.\n\nJust before the vote, leading senators delivered impassioned speeches. Senator Calheiros said the inquiry had slowed down the clock of death in Brazil.\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s vice-president, Randolfe Rodrigues, underlined how important the process had been to put pressure on the government and speed up vaccinations, and he paid tribute to those on the front line of containing the pandemic.\n\nBut for many, it\u2019s too little, too late \u2013 the families of the dead will be wanting to know where this inquiry will lead. Will Mr Bolsonaro have to stand up in court to defend his actions?\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s president, Omar Aziz, said the federal prosecutor had a duty to investigate the evidence gathered these past few months \u2013 but not everyone thinks justice will be done.\n\nIn March, Mr Bolsonaro caused outrage when he told Brazilians to \u201cstop whining\u201d about Covid, a day after the country saw a record rise in deaths over a 24-hour period.\n\nHe has continued to spread misinformation on social media and, on Monday, Facebook removed a video in which the president falsely claimed a link between Covid-19 vaccines and Aids.\n\nYouTube blocked the video and suspended Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s channel for a week.\n\nBrazil, a country of 208 million people, has recorded at least 606,000 deaths and 21.7 million cases of infection, Johns Hopkins University reports.",

          "text": "China has again said that Taiwan has \u201cno right\u201d to join the United Nations, a day after the United States voiced support for the island\u2019s \u201cmeaningful participation\u201d at the organisation.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes days after Taiwanese officials spoke with US officials about Taiwan\u2019s desire to have a role at the UN.\n\nTaiwan had held the Chinese seat at the organisation until October 25, 1971, when it was voted out as representative of the country in favour of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which won the civil war in 1949 and forced the republican government to flee to the island.\n\nSince then, Taipei has regularly sought increased participation at the UN and its array of bodies.\n\nOn Wednesday, in response to US support for Taipei\u2019s endeavour, the spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing Ma Xiaoguang said Taiwan \u201chas no right to join the United Nations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations is an international governmental organisation composed of sovereign states \u2026 Taiwan is a part of China,\u201d Xiaoguang told reporters.\n\nThat came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a statement on Tuesday, said he regretted that Taiwan had been increasingly excluded on the world stage.\n\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in the UN system is not a political issue, but a pragmatic one,\u201d Blinken said.\n\n\u201cThat is why we encourage all UN member states to join us in supporting Taiwan\u2019s robust, meaningful participation throughout the UN system and in the international community.\u201d\n\nWhile the US has long called for Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in UN activities, the latest exchange comes amid an escalation of diplomatic rhetoric and military posturing over the island, which some observers fear could bring the superpowers to the brink of confrontation.\n\nThe US, like many countries, switched recognition to the People\u2019s Republic of China in Beijing in 1979 but maintains a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d with the island under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.\n\nThe legislation mandates the US \u201cpreserve and promote extensive, close and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people of Taiwan\u201d.\n\nIn recent months, Beijing has regularly set records for the number of fighter jets it has flown near Taiwan, which it has called a warning to the government in Taipei.\n\nBeijing also recently held beach-landing exercises on its side of the roughly 160km-wide (100-mile-wide) Taiwan Strait.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden last week made waves when he told a televised forum that the US was ready to defend Taiwan from any Chinese invasion. The statement appeared to break from the longstanding US policy of not making clear how Washington would respond to such an event.\n\nThe comments were quickly walked back by the White House amid warnings from China. A White House statement said the US was \u201cnot announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy\u201d.\n\nBlinken on Tuesday reiterated that the US still recognises only Beijing.\n\nFor her part, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen welcomed Blinken\u2019s support for wider participation on the world stage.\n\n\u201cGrateful for #US support for expanding #Taiwan\u2019s international participation,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to work with all like-minded partners to contribute our expertise in international organizations, mechanisms & events.\u201d",

          "text": "The United States has issued its first passport with an \u201cX\u201d gender designation \u2014 a milestone in the recognition of the rights of people who don\u2019t identify as male or female \u2014 and expects to be able to offer the option more broadly next year, the State Department said Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. special diplomatic envoy for LGBTQ rights, Jessica Stern, called the moves historic and celebratory, saying they bring the government documents in line with the \u201clived reality\u201d that there is a wider spectrum of human sex characteristics than is reflected in the previous two designations.\n\n\u201cWhen a person obtains identity documents that reflect their true identity, they live with greater dignity and respect,\u201d Stern said.\n\nThe department did not announce to whom the passport was issued. A department official declined to say whether it was for Dana Zzyym, an intersex Colorado resident who has been in a legal battle with the department since 2015, saying the department does not usually discuss individual passport applications because of privacy concerns.\n\nZzyym (pronounced Zimm) was denied a passport for failing to check male or female on an application. According to court documents, Zzyym wrote \u201cintersex\u201d above the boxes marked \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF\u201d and requested an \u201cX\u201d gender marker instead in a separate letter.\n\nZzyym was born with ambiguous physical sexual characteristics but was raised as a boy and underwent several surgeries that failed to make Zzyym appear fully male, according to court filings. Zzyym served in the Navy as a male but later came to identify as intersex while working and studying at Colorado State University. The department\u2019s denial of Zzyym\u2019s passport prevented Zzyym from being able to travel to a meeting of Organization Intersex International in Mexico.\n\nThe State Department announced in June that it was moving toward adding a third gender marker for nonbinary, intersex and gender-nonconforming people but said it would take time because it required extensive updates to its computer systems. A department official said the passport application and system update with the \u201cX\u201d designation option still need to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget, which approves all government forms, before they can be issued.\n\nThe department now also allows applicants to self-select their gender as male or female, no longer requiring them to provide medical certification if their gender did not match that listed on their other identification documents.\n\nThe United States joins a handful of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Nepal and Canada, in allowing its citizens to designate a gender other than male or female on their passports.\n\nStern said her office planned to talk about the United States\u2019 experience with the change in its interactions around the world and she hopes that might help inspire other governments to offer the option.\n\n\u201cWe see this as a way of affirming and uplifting the human rights of trans and intersex and gender-nonconforming and nonbinary people everywhere,\u201d she said.",
