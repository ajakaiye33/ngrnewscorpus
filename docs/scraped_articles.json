          "text": "US President Joe Biden announced Thursday a new package of $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, saying it would help Kyiv in the fight against Russian forces in the Donbas region.\n\nThe Pentagon said the newest round of US support will include 72 155mm howitzers, 72 armored vehicles to tow them, 144,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 120 \u201cPhoenix Ghost\u201d tactical drones recently developed by the US Air Force specifically to address Ukraine\u2019s needs.\n\nBiden said the new package was tailored to help Ukraine\u2019s forces meet the emerging Russian offensive in the country\u2019s east, which he said would be a different kind of fight than that in the north around Kyiv, where Ukrainian forces successfully beat Russian forces back in the first six weeks of the war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a critical window now\u2026 where they\u2019re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war. And the United States and our allies and partners are moving as fast as possible to continue to provide Ukraine\u2026 the weapons their forces need to defend their nation,\u201d the president said.\n\nBiden also announced that Russia-affiliated ships would be banned from US ports, and that the US Treasury was putting up a fresh $500 million for Ukraine\u2019s government so it can pay salaries and pensions and provide services.\n\nHe said unity between the US and allies in support of Ukraine is sending \u201can unmistakable message\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cHe will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine. That will not happen,\u201d Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has pushed strongly for more and heavier weaponry, said in a tweet that he was grateful for Biden\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThis help is needed today more than ever! It saves the lives of our defenders of democracy and freedom and brings us closer to restoring peace\u201d in Ukraine, he said.\n\n\u2013 Long-range artillery -At the Pentagon, Spokesman John Kirby said that Ukrainian troops were already being trained on the M777 howitzers and that the some of the new equipment would be on its way for delivery to the embattled country by this weekend.\n\nCombined with 18 howitzers announced for Ukraine last week, the new artillery would be enough to equip five battalions, Kirby said, noting that both sides are preparing for a battle driven by long-range artillery fire.\n\nIn their training on the howitzers, Ukrainian forces \u201care very happy with the performance of the system and they\u2019re learning it quickly,\u201d said Kirby.\n\nThe new drones, he indicated, will act as both surveillance and \u201cloitering\u201d attack drones, which can hover over a target and either drop munitions or themselves crash into a target and explode at the most opportune moment.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to utilize all available tools to support Ukraine\u2019s armed forces in the face of Russian aggression,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 $4 billion in defense assistance -The new package follows $800 million in military assistance announced by the White House last week, taking to $4 billion the amount the US has put up in arms and supplies for Ukraine\u2019s forces since the start of the Biden administration in January 2021.\n\nNumerous allies in Europe have also supplied Ukraine with weapons and military supplies.\n\nBiden pledged that US military aid for Kyiv will not dry up, and said he was preparing to ask Congress for more funds \u201cto keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption.\u201d\n\nHe called on allies to continue their support.\n\n\u201cWe have the capacity to do this for a long time. The question is, are we going to maintain the support of the international community to keep the pressure on Putin\u201d and keep enforcing tough sanctions on Russia, he said.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is maintain unity,\u201d he said.\n\npmh/caw\n\n\u00a9 1994-2022 Agence France-Presse",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Fatimah Abdul\n\nWe are now at the last ten of Ramadan, Alhamdulillah for the journey so far, may Allah see us through the entire period. (Amin).\n\nHowever, it is quite essential for us to nurture the minds of our wards and reawaken their spiritual consciousness during this period. With this, they will genuinely appreciate and internalised the lessons of Ramadan while also looking forward to another Ramadan Insha Allah.\n\nImmorality they say, is generated by idleness. Prophet Muhammad (saw) said there are two blessings of which many people are careless of, which are: good health and free time.\n\nAs students enjoy their second term holiday during this fasting period, it is a better time to encourage them towards attaining taqwa, by not limiting them to the routine of waking for sahur but consciously observing their tahajud, supplicate to Allah and observing their obligatory salawats.\n\nAllah says in (Q23 v115-116) \u201cDid you think we had created you in play without any purpose, and that you would not be brought back to us, so exalted is Allah, the sovereign, the truth.\u201d\n\nDear mothers, wouldn\u2019t you rather earn yourself an additional reward in this life and in the hereafter by consistently reminding your wards of their duties to Allah, as the majority of our Muslim teens are unaware of dos and don\u2019ts of this holy month. They engage in different unwarranted activities on social media to while away their time, rather than focusing on spiritual purifying acts.\n\nTherefore, hasten them towards reading and memorizing the Quran, listening to Tafsirs, and reflecting on the stories of the prophets and meanings of surahs, among other rewarding acts.\n\nit is imperative our wards outlive the lessons of Ramadan, as it will no doubt, shape their lives positively, both inwardly and outwardly. May Allah make it easy for us to raise righteous kids. (Amin)\n\nRamadan: Time for spiritual seclusion\n\nAt this point of the holy month, when the last ten days are rolling in, every Muslim should deepen himself in the acts of ibadah. The most important part of Ramadan is said to be the last 10 days. The revelation of the Qur\u2019an, the night of majesty, the blessings, among others, had been perfected in it.\n\nThe last 10 days should be spent in prayers, seeking Allah`s mercy and asking for His forgiveness, observing I\u2019itikaf, searching for Layalat-ul-Qadr, doing good deeds, reflecting on your actions, reading of Holy Qur\u2019an and supplicating to Allah.\n\nThis is a tradition which has been in Islam from the first days of the revelation and is also something known and recognised as the practice of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) and ordained by Allah (SWT).\n\n\u201cAnd when We made the House a pilgrimage for mankind and a (place of) security, and said \u2018Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim (Maqama-Ibrahim).\u2019 And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail saying: \u2018Purify My House for those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it) for devotion, those who bow down (and) those who prostrate themselves.\u2019 Q 2:125\n\nThe act of confining oneself to the mosque for some period for the sake of Allah is meritorious. You will be detached from worldly affairs and get closer to Allah. You also have the advantage of seeking the Night of Majesty as you will have the opportunity of having no distraction from family members and worldly affairs.\n\nAlthough there is no specific number of days for Itikaf, it can be one, three, five, seven or more according to the intention for doing that. But the last ten days will be more appropriate if to seek the Night of Majesty.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have the opportunity of doing Itikaf in Masjid Haram, we can observe it in our local mosque. A number of mosques in various cities have put in places measures and facilities to do that. The National Mosque, Abuja which used to host several hundreds of Muslims in the past had in a statement before the commencement of Ramadan suspended Itikaf this Ramadan due to further renovation work going on.\n\nIt is not late however to embark on Itikaf, Sururatudeen Mosque Igbogb road, Ikorodu, Alausa Central Mosque, Lekki Central Mosque among other mosques in Lagos still open for any intending Mu\u2019takiff.",

          "text": "By Babajide Komolafe, Economy Editor & Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that Nigeria\u2019s total public debt will rise steadily to 44.2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product, GDP, by 2027.\n\nThe IMF gave this forecast in its April Fiscal Monitor, released yesterday, in Washington, adding that the total fiscal spending of the General Government (Federal and state governments) will widen to 6.4 per cent of GDP this year, 2022, from 6.0 per cent at the end of 2021.\n\nAccording to the Debt Management Office, DMO, national public debt rose by 20 per cent, year-on-year, YoY, to N39.56 trillion in 2021 from N32.92 trillion in 2020.\n\n\u201cWith the Total Public Debt Stock to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as at December 31, 2021, of 22.47 per cent, the Debt-to-GDP ratio still remains within Nigeria\u2019s self-imposed limit of 40%\u201d, the DMO said.\n\nThe IMF however disagreed, stating that nation\u2019s Debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 37.0 per cent at the end of 2021, and will rise to 37.4 per cent in 2022, 38.8 per cent in 2023, 40.2 per cent in 2024, 41.6 per cent in 2025, 42.9 per cent in 2026 and to 44.2 per cent in 2027.\n\nThe IMF also projected that the General Government fiscal deficit would slightly improve from 6.4 per cent to 5.9 in 2023 and 2024, before deteriorating, once again, to 6.1 in 2025, 6.3 per cent in 2026 and 6.4 per cent in 2027.\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF has warned that the global community faced a general debt spike, food shortage-related unrests and energy crisis.\n\nThe release of the April 2022 Fiscal Monitor, with the theme, \u201cFiscal Policy from Pandemic to War\u201d was part of the on-going Spring Meetings of the World Bank / IMF Spring Meetings.\n\nThe report said of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, \u201cBesides the death toll, human misery, and destruction of infrastructure, the war is causing costly displacement of refugees and loss of human capital, disrupting commodity markets, and further fueling inflation. Higher food and energy prices raise the risks of social unrest.\n\n\u201cEmerging markets and low-income developing countries serving as net importers of energy and food will be hit by elevated international prices, putting pressure both on growth and public finances.\u201d\n\nAt a press briefing on the Fiscal Monitor, also yesterday, Vitor Gaspar, Director, Fiscal Affairs Department of the Fund, emphasised the risks of debt, food security and energy security, which the world faced.",

          "title": "From 7 to 70: Why are they not talking about this, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "From 7 to 70: Why are they not talking about this, by Femi Adesina\n\nLast week on this platform, focus was on the fact that adversaries of the Muhammadu Buhari administration were hiding behind the smokescreen of insecurity to vent their spleen.\n\nWe stressed that security was everything, and noted that while robustly confronting the monster of insecurity, President Buhari was equally taking giant strides on many other fronts, which the caterwauling crowd deliberately ignores.\n\nToday, let\u2019s dwell on something they have deliberately refused to see, hear, and chose not to talk about. But whether they see it or not, talk about it or ignore, it is there, as conspicuous as a tiger in a tea shop.\n\nA fortnight ago, members of the Fertilizers Producers and Suppliers Association of Nigeria (FEPSAN) visited the President at State House, Abuja. And among others, this information came out from Mr Thomas Etuh, President of the body:\n\n\u201cMr President, before you created the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative in 2016, Nigeria\u2019s fertilizer production base was almost zero. We had less than 7 companies producing at 100% of their installed capacity. Nigeria\u2019s Urea output was reported at less than 300,000 tons.\n\n\u201cToday, Nigeria can boast of having some 70 NPK blending plants. 95% of this investment is from the private sector. This is a clear sign of the confidence investors have in Mr President\u2019s policies and programs.\u201d\n\nFrom 7 to 70 blending plants just under Buhari! But why are they not talking about it? Because it doesn\u2019t fit into the narrative they want Nigerians to buy and imbibe. The country is broken under Buhari. It is divided. He has made a poor job of leading the country. That is what the poor salesmen sell.\n\nI hear! When you hate a baby, you claim that the midwife that begat him is a witch. What has that got to do with the innocent tot? Their snouts have been yanked from the honeypot, so they are throwing tantrums. Politicians, so-called civil rights activists, priests, talk show hosts, and many others. All they want is to have the illicit bread back. So they must create the impression that Buhari did nothing.\n\nFrom 7 to 70. Why are they not talking about it? No, it doesn\u2019t serve their interests, so they would pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe FEPSAN boss had many other things to say:\n\n\u201cIn the past 2 months alone, you officially commissioned the Barbados NPK blending plant in Kaduna and the Dangote Urea plant in Lagos. ..Such an honour in a very short period clearly shows the love you have for us and your desire for FEPSAN to succeed. For many of us, we still cannot believe that a President would honour the invitation of not one, but two of our members within a short period of time. It is such open support that encourages our members to continue investing.\u201d\n\nBut they said Nigeria was broken, and that the only thing happening was insecurity. How then did the 63 new blending plants spring up? If the investors didn\u2019t believe in the country, would they invest such humongous resources? Would you put several millions of naira in a polity that could go up in smoke at the next minute? No, you wouldn\u2019t. So, the fact that investors continue to put their funds here belie their narrative that Nigeria was broken, and nothing was working. They lie through their teeth just because of the lust for power, and filthy lucre. They pine and hanker after those days that you did nothing, and government just brought bags of money to you at home. Buhari wouldn\u2019t do that, so they must badmouth him, paint him black, and run him out of town, if possible.\n\nFrom 7 to 70 fertilizer blending plants in 7 years. Why are they not talking about it? No, they wouldn\u2019t, because they want a return of those days when the country earns billions of dollars from oil, and it is used to oil their pockets. The rich get richer, and the poor gets prison. The new order pains them like mad.\n\nHear how Etuh described what used to happen in the country: \u201cThe low base reflects the adverse impact of historical Government policies that promoted the dumping of all sorts of imported fertilizer blends in Nigeria. Our farmers were forced to use imported fertilizers which in most cases are not compatible with the nutritional needs of our land.\n\n\u201cAll this is now past. By the special grace of God\u2026Nigerian farmers will never go back to those dark days.\u201d\n\nA resounding amen, somebody! Whether they acknowledge the good things going on or not, this country won\u2019t return to the rent seeking era, where you sit idly, and because you are a priest, critic, social activist, media personality, politician, or what, they just bring loads of cash to your house to curry favor. Buhari hasn\u2019t done it, he won\u2019t do it, and we shouldn\u2019t do it as a country.\n\nFrom 7 blending plants to 70 under Buhari. Why are they not talking about it? It doesn\u2019t favor their selfish intentions. It is said that in over 12 years, Nigeria has seen its highest consumption of fertilizers at 1.8 million tons per annum in 2021. But does it interest them? Never! They don\u2019t care, and can\u2019t be bothered.\n\n\u201cToday, many nations who rely on fertilizer imports are facing acute shortages as a result of the events in Eastern Europe. However, Nigeria remains one of the few countries in Africa and indeed the world, where fertilizer availability is not an issue,\u201d Thomas Etuh said.\n\nTruly, President Buhari is a man who saw tomorrow. He focused on agriculture, funded it massively, encouraged people to go back to the land, and we have a lot to be thankful for today.\n\nIn the wake of COVID-19 and the attendant global lockdown and food supply challenges, how would 200 million people have survived, if we were not producing what we eat locally, as encouraged by the President? But they won\u2019t talk about it, because it doesn\u2019t fit into their narrative. They only allege that the country is broken, divided, not recognizing that they were the very people breaking and dividing it with their mouths.\n\nCentral Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed at the FEPSAN meeting with the President that cumulatively, a total of N114.09 billion has been disbursed to support the fertilizer industry in the last five years. The interventions are long-term loans at concessionary interest rates. That\u2019s what you call putting your money where your mouth is. In the past, such funds would have ended in the pockets of government officials, and in those of some priests, critics, and other jobbers. From 7 to 70 blending plants under Buhari. That\u2019s why they are not talking about it.\n\nHear this information that came as I was concluding this piece. According to acting Comptroller of the Federal Fire Service, Dr Karebo Samson, in 2015, when Buhari came to office, there were only 3 functioning fire trucks in the country, two in Lagos, one in Abuja. But today, there are 189 brand new fire trucks in the Service, apart from new ambulances, water tankers, etc. Why are they not talking about it? It doesn\u2019t serve their interest in portraying Nigeria as broken and divided.\n\nThey live their lives perpetually on the complaint counter. But with the realization of the progress being made by patriotic Nigerians, they will be soused and marooned in that inglorious place for a long time to come. The people are not ready to return to the dark past, whether those tiny but vocal minority talk about the good things happening or not. Forward we move.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

The most important thing, for now, is the acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence\n\n\u201cAnd I need to make it very clear, I have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\u201d\n\nOn why is it difficult to deploy technology, especially in some areas where the military has been having problems, he said: \u201cOne, technology is expensive.

Since inherently we do not produce this very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes.\u201d\n\nHe added that the surrendering of Boko Haram elements had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country.\n\nThe NSA also spoke on the threats coming from the country\u2019s vast land borders and the need to replicate in them what has been achieved in the maritime borders.\n\nHe also stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society is willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity will linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nOn the recent arms deal with the United States government, he said both countries came to an agreement to sell some military equipment to Nigeria, after the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari and himself travelled to the US, where they made a presentation to members of the Congress.",

          "title": "Buhari: Military Not Doing Enough to End Insecurity Despite Logistics Provided",
          "text": "\n\n*Fears situation may linger except citizens offer information*Orders release of kidnapped Kaduna train passengers\n\n*IG justifies police presence in South-east, says attacks on officers no longer tolerated\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIn a clear indictment, a disappointed President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, told the security agencies that they were not doing enough to end the security challenges in the country, despite enormous logistics provided by his administration.\n\nBuhari frowned on the fact that his previous directives to the military to end insecurity in the country had not yielded much results.\n\nHe directed all the operational and intelligence agencies to rescue unhurt, all persons kidnapped by terrorists, including those in the recent Kaduna-bound train.\n\nThat was as the the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, explained the basis for heavy security presence in the South-east, saying the police would no longer tolerate attacks on their men.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), expressed the president\u2019s reservation while speaking with newsmen yesterday after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja, presided by Buhari.\n\nMonguno said there was no way the president would be happy, when people were being killed on a daily basis. He said the last straw was the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which led to the death of some passengers, with scores kidnapped.\n\nThe NSA added that the president was of the belief that enough was not being done by the security agencies, despite the logistics being provided.\n\nMonguno stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a sitting of the National Security Council, a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was presided over by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This meeting is the first for 2022 and the meeting deliberated on several issues, at the strategic and operational levels, as well as other issues that are broader.\n\n\u201cIn his opening remarks, he (Buhari) spoke about his sadness in respect of the recent developments in the country, the recent security challenges we\u2019ve had, in particular, the incident in which several Nigerians lost their lives and many more have been taken into captivity by criminals and bandits.\n\n\u201cIf ten times something happens, ten times (we) will be unhappy and as the leader of this country, the father of the nation, he has to express his displeasure. You know, he is just at the managerial level, he gives us instructions.\n\n\u201cAnd his displeasure is probably, because he feels enough is not being done. So, we can\u2019t put this thing on his shoulders completely. He\u2019s at the strategic level, he takes the decisions. But when these things become endless, he has to express concern. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed all the operational and intelligence elements to rescue these innocent people immediately and unhurt. This is the basis, which other issues were discussed. Obviously, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the service chiefs, as well as the Inspector-General of Police, all briefed the President on the occurrences in their respective organisations.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed that the president alone could not be blamed for the insecurity in the country, saying his part is to make strategic decisions, which the NSA said he has been doing even though he said that the military has secured the nation\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cI submitted a memo to council and my recommendations are being looked into by the president. My recommendations are wide ranging and they touch on all aspects of security, starting with the level of security of our land borders, as well as within the country itself.\n\n\u201cIn terms of securing the nation, we\u2019ve recorded a lot of successes in the maritime domain and obviously, the problem now has shifted to our borders from outside. As a result of that, there\u2019s a need for us to configure how we\u2019re going to make our borders more secure because of the threats coming from outside the borders.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the surrendering of Boko Haram elements, especially in the North-east, had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country, as the threat had shifted to the Northwest and North Central.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, the issue in the North-east, there\u2019s been a lot of improvement and that has been attested to by the governor of Borno State during our last National Council of State meeting. But, nevertheless, the fact that the North-east is becoming much more stable, more and more people from the terrorists have started surrendering to government, has not really brought to an end the way we would want the situation in the country, because the threat is now shifted from the North-east, to the North-west and to the North-central, and this threat has to be contained.\n\n\u201cIt has to be contained collectively by both the armed forces as well as the constabulary forces: the Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, but the intelligence agencies also have been directed to enhance the acquisition of intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society was willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity would linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe present situation in the country calls for collective effort by all, not just those that have been charged with the responsibility of physically securing the country, the most important thing for now is acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence and I need to make it very clear.\n\n\u201cI have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\n\n\u201cA lot of lives are being lost, the president is not happy about this situation, he\u2019s made it very clear. The first assignment he\u2019s given to the security agencies, especially, the armed forces and the police is to rescue those that are in captivity, not just those that were captured during the last train incident, but those that have been in captivity in other parts of the country. That is the first thing that has to be done.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, my memo dwells on the prevailing situation within the security outfits; their needs, their challenges and the President has decided to look into these things and might as well call for another meeting in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn why the country had not deplored technology to tackle the menace of terrorism and banditry, Monguno said effort was being made to deploy technology to tackle insecurity but submitted that the required technology was expensive and would take time to acquire.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe first question has to do with, why is it so difficult to deploy technology. One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things, since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have, but the plight is that they are inadequate, so, to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nOn alleged sabotage within the military in the fight against terrorism, Monguno said the possibility of having rogue elements could not be ruled out.\n\nAsked whether he would draw a correlation between the threats from the border and the level of insecurity in the country and whether there was any suggestion that foreigners might have been responsible for the insecurity in the country, he said, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact; it\u2019s not a conjecture. I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of efforts to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that counsel is looking into.\u201d\n\nThe IGP addressed the question of massive police presence in South-east. Baba said, \u201cI think the question is about deployment. Deployment is being determined by a lot of issues or yardsticks.\n\n\u201cJust like two states may have different number of local governments, so also there can be different number of formations in that state or in that formation. We have formations, we have commands, we have zonal commands and so forth. So, deployment should not be based on either size or number of persons or threat assessment tool in that place.\n\n\u201cIt is all about how you police a particular place based on the number of people you have, based also on your ability to gather that manpower. If your command, for instance, Kaduna command has, let\u2019s say 3000 personnel. For now, I know already that 3,000 personnel cannot take care of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWhat we normally do is to deploy from other states to come and complement the efforts of Kaduna by what we are calling, let\u2019s say, special duty. We can take from states, where we feel the threat is not as eminent or as bad as what they have in Kaduna, so that you can complement Kaduna. So, also you can complement Imo, Anambra. It\u2019s based on your threat analysis.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Baba, has warned that the police high command would no longer tolerate incessant killing of police officers in the country especially, the South-east.\n\nHe condemned the recent spate of attacks on police officers, facilities and other police operational assets across the country.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, consequently, ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and other operations launched with the aim of flushing out criminal elements, who hide under the guise of aggrieved citizens to perpetrate criminal acts.\n\n\u201cThe IG warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the IG reiterated the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property, while stressing that it was vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives, in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Says ruling party can\u2019t afford to joke around *Osinbajo popular enough to pool donations to raise N100m, supporters insist *Ebri: prohibitive cost vitiate very principles upon which party rose to power *Ayu tackles APC over outrageous nomination forms Ozekhome: Buhari, APC corrupting democracy\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nFollowing public outrage over the high cost of nomination forms for aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC), the ruling party yesterday explained that the fee was pegged at the rate needed to lock out unserious contenders.\n\nAPC\u2019s defence of the price of its nominations forms, which was announced Wednesday, came as Chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP) and senator for Kano South, Senator Kabiru Gaya, expressed confidence in Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy. Gaya said, unlike the moneybags, Osinbajo\u2019s popularity would facilitate the pooling of his supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee for his presidential bid.\n\nHowever, National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and former Governor of Cross River State, Chief Clement Ebri, condemned the high nomination cost for elective offices announced by APC.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, also criticised APC for \u201ccorrupting democracy\u201d with the high nomination fee, saying the N100 million fixed for its presidential nomination form \u201crightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged yesterday that President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, was under intense pressure from a section of the northern elite to run for president in 2023.\n\nThe ruling party had during its 11th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Abuja pegged its presidential nomination form at N100 million, governorship at N50 million, Senate at N20 million, House of Representatives at N10 million, and House of Assembly at N2 million.\n\nAPC National Women Leader, Beta Edu, featuring on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Arise News Channel, yesterday, said the high rate of the ruling party\u2019s nomination forms was to curtail the activities of persons with jokey ambitions. Edu said the APC National Working Committee (NWC) had consciously fixed the rate as part of a mechanism to ensure only serious aspirants were on the ballot.\n\nShe said the ruling party could not afford to waste time, especially considering the fact that it was working in line with the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nEdu stated, \u201cEverywhere around the world, running for elections has never been cheap and the party must be able to have means to guard several other issues that may arise. You find people who are not interested in running for elections just standing up, picking up forms and just waiting to constitute a kind of barrier or put a stud in the entire process as it goes on.\n\n\u201cThese are not things that we want to see as a party. We are the ruling party, the largest party in Africa, a party where if you pick their nomination form and you are the candidate, the probability of you becoming the elected person for that position is almost hundred per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot afford to dabble or joke around or gamble around. We want only serious people who are interested in running and representing different persons to run.\u201d\n\nEdu claimed the cost of forms for House of Assembly was fair.\n\nShe stated, \u201cFor all we care, N1.5 million for a House of Assembly nomination form is fair to the general population. It\u2019s very fair and for women it\u2019s free, for the disabled, it is free; for young people, it is 40 per cent off, that\u2019s really very fair.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, going for the other positions, we know what it was before and what it is now and we are trying to prevent certain persons who sometimes are not the members of the party. They just get their way in or they\u2019re being used as syndicate to pick up forms at the beginning to constitute a kind of stud in the way of the whole electoral process and they pull the party backwards.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain her definition of fairness with regard to the ruling party\u2019s high nomination fee in a country where over 98 per cent of the population did not have N500, 000 in their bank accounts, the APC women leader stated that running for elective office was not an all-comers affair.\n\nEdu said, \u201cLet me say this and very clearly, coming to run for a governorship election is not an all-comers affair. Governorship election is serious business, for you to run through all the local governments, consult people, reach out to people and, indeed, be able to campaign through the local governments requires some good amount of resources. And when you make up your mind that you want to run, you should be able to prepare adequately for that race.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, there are many ways for young people to generate funding for elections. It must not be your money and they are not paying the same amount others are paying.\u201d\n\nOn rising disunity within the party, Edu said as part of the reconciliation committee, headed by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, she believed his view that most of the crises in the states were fuelled by ego clash between serving and former governors.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe went through all the states in Nigeria and we understood the issues and concerns about unity or some disagreements among members of the party and, of course, like the chairman clearly stated yesterday (Wednesday), if we work together, we can to overcome it soon.\u201d\n\nShe said, as the party moved closer to the elections, more aggrieved members would be reconciled.\n\nOsinbajo Popular Enough to Pool Donations to Raise N100m, Supporters Insist\n\n\n\nGaya said Osinbajo was popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee with ease.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Gaya said consultations by members of various support groups, eminent political leaders, and citizens, too numerous to mention, culminated in his decision to lead the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 group.\n\nHe noted that for the vice president, the race was not about personal ambition, but a positive response to a popular call from a citizen-driven mobilisation that began without input from him or his office. The lawmaker stressed that people from other parties and even millions of non-partisan citizens, who did not belong to any political party, had strong interest and involvement with the campaign for Osinbajo\u2019s candidature.\n\nGaya stressed that his specific assignment here was to lead a process of recalibration of all pro-Osinbajo forces towards electoral victory on the platform of APC. He said without doubt, all knowledgeable people in the country could attest to the qualities and competence of Osinbajo.\n\nGaya noted that his chosen method redefined presidential declarations in Nigeria, adding that the vice president clearly signalled that noble citizens had no need to descend into gutters. No touts were hired by anyone and his message effectively reverberated across the entire country and the Diaspora, he stated.\n\nAccording to Gaya, \u201cEven an internal issue of the price of our party\u2019s nomination form is being deliberately misinterpreted in some circles, when we feel confident that, unlike moneybags, our truly populist candidate is popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations and raise such money with ease.\n\n\u201cJust one youth group with TPP, the Progressive Group alone, says that they can raise N100 million with rough voluntary contributions of N10, 000 each by 10, 000 of their supporters, who are keen about seeing a better future.\n\n\u201cOur populist mathematics is flawless and very strong; moneybags within or outside APC will only lose their dollars in any contest against the people\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Gaya said, unlike other political parties, records show that neither the APC presidential ticket nor its vice president\u2019s slot had ever been won by throwing money around, but by populist endorsements from the north and south.\n\nHe said the TPP noted the fear of the people\u2019s genuine power had made some elements to resort to heightened propaganda in the past few days.\n\nGaya added, \u201cWe will not descend low to play gutter politics and we have continued to warn our supporters against involvement in insults and vilification. We are democrats, we believe in uniting people and in submitting ourselves and competing ideas to the people\u2019s evaluation and decisions through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain emphasised that the popular forces behind Osinbajo feared no foe and hated no one, saying they are focused without compromise on the unity, progress and development of Nigeria and would not descend into gutter fights with any person or group.\n\nLawan Under Pressure to Join Presidential Race\n\n\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that the senate president was under intense pressure to contest for president in 2023. The ruling party released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections, but maintained sealed lips on the issue of zoning.\n\nAlthough, following the emergence of Adamu as National Chairman of the party at the March 26 convention, observers believed it was an indication that the ruling party would zone its presidency to the south.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, had said that the party was yet to take any decision on the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that some elements within the northern elite were mounting pressure on Lawan to join the presidential race.\n\nThe source said, \u201cYes, he is under intense pressure to run for president. Some northern leaders are making the moves, asking him to run. It\u2019s so serious. But it is not certain yet. It\u2019s an option he\u2019s still considering.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, two businessmen from Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, have promised to obtain presidential nomination forms for Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Kalu, and Lawan. The businessmen disclosed this in a statement issued yesterday and signed by Mr. Ukaegbu James and Mr. Nnanna Kalu.\n\nThey said they were convinced that with their track record, managerial skills, experience, and leadership acumen, both Kalu and Lawan had the competence to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to drive the economy. James and Kalu were of the opinion that APC needed a unifier with deep knowledge of the country\u2019s multi-ethnic, lingual and religious settings.\n\nAyu Tackles APC over Outrageous Nomination Fee, Extends Sale, Submission of Forms to Accommodate Defectors\n\n\n\nPDP extended the sale of its nominations forms to Friday, to accommodate some APC defectors, like Senator Babba Kaita and his supporters. This was to enable them purchase any form of their choice for the 2023 general election.\n\nCommenting on the high price of the APC nomination forms, Ayu, in a statement by his media aide, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said, \u201cNigerians can all see what the APC is: a fragmented alliance put together to capture power and inflict maximum pain on Nigerians, including their own members.\u201d\n\nAyu urged Nigerians to recall how in 2014, President Muhammadu Buhari and leader of APC had told Nigerians then that he borrowed N27 million to buy his nomination form.\n\n\u201cThe same man, as leader of his party, has now sanctioned the sale of the same forms at N100 million! I am told that\u2019s an increase of 370 per cent,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nHe added, \u201cBut in 2014, the PDP was in power and the economy was still booming. The incompetent APC presidency has now run the economy aground, making Nigeria the \u2018Poverty Capital of the World.\u2019\n\n\u201cHow then can impoverished APC aspirants buy nominations at such prohibitively high costs? And yet, only recently he preached \u2018Equal Opportunity\u2019 to them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman of PDP said, \u201cBy this latest insensitive action, the APC has disenfranchised thousands of her youths, and dashed the hopes of millions of Nigerian youths who applauded President Buhari when he signed the Not Too Young To Run Bill into law in 2018. It is most insensitive, and mind-boggling. In fact, all those buying the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed, \u201cWe, the PDP, are different. We are a mass movement for the Nigerian people. This is why our nomination fees are soft and democratic. When you compare us with the APC, the difference is clear. This is why we must return to power to save Nigerians from this insensitive government.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former governor of Cross River State, Clement Ebri, condemned the high cost of forms for Expression of Interest and nomination for elective offices announced by the ruling party. Ebri said it vitiated the principles upon which APC campaigned and was voted into power.\n\nHe called on the NWC of the party to rethink the party\u2019s position on the matter.\n\nEbri, in a statement issued yesterday, said some people might have argued that the reason for the exorbitant cost of nomination forms was simply to prune the number of contenders, or to delineate the pretenders from the contenders, saying, \u201cThen I think that argument is flawed.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said true party men and women should be concerned that the party, which was founded on the values and ideals of progressive philosophy, would make pre-qualification for elective offices \u2013 at state and national level \u2013 the exclusive preserve of party members with either great personal wealth or that have unlimited access to other sources of funding.\n\nEbri added, \u201cWith reference to the recent announcement by the APC concerning the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for various elective positions, the APC owes it to itself and the teeming numbers of Nigerians who voted it into power for two consecutive terms, to remain a party of true progressives and a true party of progressives.\n\n\u201cThe current party position on the cost of forms for Expression of Interest and Nomination for elective offices appears to vitiate the very principles upon which the party campaigned and was voted into power.\n\n\u201cThe danger this poses to the party is that many prospective and otherwise eminently qualified office seekers that do not possess enormous personal wealth will in every practical sense, be precluded from seeking party nomination, regardless of the depth and breadth of their popular support.\u201d\n\nEbri said there were ample objective and progressive criteria, such as integrity, experience, character, political antecedents, empathy, intelligence, goodwill, etc, which could be employed to enable the emergence of genuinely qualified candidates.\n\nHe said it was a known fact that personal wealth was not the yardstick of assessment that enabled Buhari to emerge as standard-bearer of the party in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe party chieftain noted that a comparative analysis of the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms in APC and that of the main opposition PDP showed that a member of APC with governorship aspiration would not only be spending more than twice what his/her counterparts in the opposition are, but would also be spending more to vie for governorship office than the opposition candidates vying for the office of president.\n\nEbri stressed that as laudable as the concession of 50 per cent reduction for youths might seem, it was worthy of note that the youth in the APC that were vying for governorship would still be paying more than their opposition counterparts.\n\nHe added that youths vying for the presidential ticket would be paying more than what the opposition presidential aspirants were paying for nomination. The party chieftain wondered if APC had inadvertently been made a party of the wealthy by the wealthy for the wealthy.\n\nMeanwhile, in an apparent move to accommodate defectors from APC, PDP extended the sale and submission of its nomination forms for the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cAfter a thorough consideration of various issues and concerns in the party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has further adjusted its Timetable and Schedule of Activities to extend the closing dates for the purchase of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2023 general elections to Friday, April 22, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the reviewed timetable, the last day for the submission of already completed Forms has been extended to Monday, April 25, 2022\n\n\u201cConsequently, the following new dates have been fixed for the screening as well as Appeals arising from the screening of aspirants for various positions:\n\n\u201cState House of Assembly and National Assembly: Wednesday, April 27, 2022; Governorship: Thursday, April 28, 2022; Presidential: Friday, April 29, 2022. Appeals on all screening exercised: Monday, May 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the updated timetable, the three-man Ad Hoc Ward Congress has been fixed for Saturday, April 30, 2022 while the Local Government Area National Delegates Congresses will now hold on Thursday, May 5, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cAll dates for primary election into various positions remain the same. Please, note that all duly completed State Assembly Forms are to be submitted at the various states secretariat of the party.\n\n\u201cAll aspirants, critical stakeholders and party members should be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nOzekhome: Buhari, APC Corrupting Democracy\n\n\n\nOzekhome accused the president and the ruling party of debasing democracy in a statement yesterday titled, \u201cPresident Buhari and the APC are corrupting democracy.\u201d\n\nThe statement was in response to Wednesday\u2019s announcement by the ruling party fixing various high fees for its nomination forms, which had outraged many Nigerians.\n\nOzekhome stated, \u201cThe staggering sum of N100 million fixed by the APC NEC for its presidential nomination form has rightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country. The APC had fixed N30 million for the \u2018expression of interest form\u2019 and N70 million for the \u2018nomination form\u2019, making a total of N100 million.\n\n\u201cThe party hopes to rake in N1.5 billion from the 15 aspirants that have so far declared interest in the presidential race. By this singular act, the APC has shown a shocking insatiable bacchanalian propensity to corrupt democracy, democratic ethos, and also scam the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of this exercise lies not just in the abominable fee prescribed, but more in the party\u2019s pretentious mantra of fighting corruption, using a well orchestrated and carefully oiled Hitler\u2019s Goebel\u2019s propagandist machinery of dubious pedigree. It is the more abhorrent when we realise that this is miles apart from (indeed more than double) the price fixed by the party\u2019s whipping child, the opposition PDP, which has fixed its at N40million (N5 million) for the expression of interest; and N35 million for the nomination form. The N100m is also over 100 per cent of the N40 million fixed by the same APC for the 2018, presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammed Buhari and the APC have, by this singular act, exhibited a very odious and unpleasant example of how not to fight corruption. They have managed to convince Nigerians that politics is, indeed, the art of grand deception, double-dealing, duplicity, beguilement, sham and self-contradiction. They have justified the clich\u00e9 that diplomacy is the clever art of telling a person to go to hell in such a way that he actually eagerly looks forward to the journey.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Says it\u2019s determined next national polls must hold *Declares timetable, schedule of activities fixed\n\n*Advises parties to plan properly, insists PVC doesn\u2019t expire *NSA: We\u2019ll protect electoral body, Nigerians during voting\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, said it would require about one million electoral officials \u2013 a combination of permanent, temporary and ad hoc staff \u2013 to be deployed to man the 176,846 polling units in 8,809 wards and 774 local government areas across the country, for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC, which claimed it was determined to make sure the 2023 elections hold, however, said the dates for all activities in the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 polls were already fixed, and therefore advised all stakeholders, particularly the political parties, to take that fact into consideration in planning their activities.\n\nSpeaking at the presentation of INEC 2022 to 2026 strategic Plan and 2023 Election Project Plan, National Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, also reiterated that claims doing the rounds that the Permanent Voter\u2019s Card could expire was misleading, because there was no such thing.\n\nAt the same time, the National Security Adviser, Major-General Babagana Munguno, has assured INEC and Nigerians in general of adequate protections during the elections.\n\nWhile explaining that double registration by any voter remained an electoral offence, Yakubu said, \u201cAs you may be aware, the election will be conducted for 1,491 constituencies nationwide, made up of one presidential constituency, 109 senatorial districts, 360 federal constituencies, 28 governorship elections and 993 state constituencies.\n\n\u201cThe election will involve an estimated one million electoral officials (both permanent and temporary or ad hoc staff) deployed to 176,846 polling units in 8,809 Wards and 774 Local Government Areas across the country.\n\n\u201cThe election will be governed by a new Electoral Act 2022, which contains many progressive provisions that, will enhance the capacity of the Commission to conduct elections and manage the electoral process better,\u201d he explained.\n\nTo this end, the INEC chairman said, \u201cLet\u2019s once again reiterate that the dates for all activities in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election are firm and fixed and all stakeholders are advised to take this into consideration in planning their activities.\u201d\n\nHe said the ongoing Continuous Voter registration (CVR) exercise would end on June 30, 2022, while all eligible voters that were yet to register should do so on or before that date if they intended to vote.\n\nStressing that the PVCs of validly registered voters from the first and second quarters were ready and available for collection at designated centres nationwide, Yakubu said, \u201cI would like to appeal to all Nigerians, who registered between June and December 2021 to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) in person as no PVCs will be collected by proxy.\n\n\u201cLet me also reassure those who registered between January and March 2022 as well as those who are doing so until the end of the exercise that their PVCs will be ready for collection long before the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, the Commission once again reiterates that PVCs have no expiry dates. We want to assure all registered voters that PVCs issued by the Commission remain valid for all elections.\n\n\u201cWe have encouraged those whose lost their voters cards or whose cards are damaged to approach any of the registration centres to apply for replacement. Similarly, voters who had issues with their accreditation in previous elections have been encouraged to revalidate and update their information.\n\n\u201cIn addition, those who wish to transfer their registration from one location to another within a particular state or to relocate entirely to another state of the federation can do so at any of the registration centres nationwide. These steps are in compliance with the law in order to serve Nigerians better.\n\n\u201cThe claim that PVCs expire is misleading. Citizens are, therefore, advised not to register more than once as multiple registration is an offence under the Electoral Act. Anyone engaged in the act of double or multiple registration is liable to prosecution. No citizen should engage in it or encourage others to violate the law,\u201d the INEC chairman warned.\n\nAccording to him, INEC relied on three key elements to reach its strategic plan for the 2022 and 2026 Election Project, adding that, \u201cFirst is the knowledge and experience gathered from the conduct of previous elections. Second is the use of innovations to enhance electoral integrity and improve voter experience. Third is the institutionalisation of the culture of planning.\n\n\u201cThese elements have guided the Commission through three successive general and several off-cycle and bye-elections. Consequently, our elections are getting better, electoral outcomes less contentious, and voter experience of the electoral system increasingly more participatory and inclusive.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the Strategic Plan 2022-2026 and the 2023 Election Project Plan, drew lessons from, and thoroughly reviewed, the level of implementation of the last plans.\n\nHis words: \u201cThey build on the successes of the preceding plans, especially, in the planning and conduct of the 2019 General Election as well as off-cycle and bye-elections. Against the backdrop of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current security situation in the country, both plans had to prioritise the institutionalisation of the Commission\u2019s processes for the effective delivery of its mandate by focusing on capacity-building.\u201d\n\nThis, he added, included, \u201cThe promotion of professionalism, encouraging greater synergy among departments, improving efficient utilisation of resources, increased deployment of technology as well as greater sensitivity to threats to the electoral process as well as election personnel and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThese concerns, he posited were reflected in the Plan\u2019s five strategic objectives, each of which identified several key actions, key activities and key outcomes that constituted a broad guide to the vision of the Commission to provide electoral operations, systems and infrastructure to support the delivery of free, fair, credible and inclusive elections.\n\nHe noted also that, the plan further formed the basis for the Election Project Plan, which focused on five key objectives identified by the Commission as critical for the successful conduct of the 2023 General Election.\n\nThe INEC chairman, therefore, posited that, \u201cBy next week, the Commission will conclude the revision of the Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections to comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cWork has also commenced on the review of the manuals for the training of election duty personnel. With the planning processes virtually completed, the Commission will now focus its attention on election technology and election administration.\n\n\u201cWe have carefully listened to the demand of Nigerians for seamless processes, particularly, with regard to enhanced voter education, better distribution of voters to polling units, quality training of election personnel, functionality of electronic devices, improved logistics, prompt commencement of polls, availability of assistive devices for persons with disability at polling units and greater transparency in result management. We are also aware of the security challenges and their impact on the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage early and intensely with the security agencies to ensure the safety of our personnel and materials, accredited observers and the media and, above all, the voters. Clearly, these are challenging times but we are determined that election must hold in 2023.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is a shared responsibility. INEC plays a critical role but the Commission alone cannot deliver the elections we all desire. I, therefore, appeal to all Nigerians to joins hands with us in ensuring that we make a success of the process.\u201d\n\nIn his comments, Sanusi Galadima, who represented the NSA, assured INEC and Nigerians of adequate protections during the general elections, even as he commended the commission for deepening democracy in Nigeria through technology.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the Inter Party advisory Council, Sani Yagbaji, called on the judiciary to avoid a situation, where it would render ridiculous judgements as was the case in the Imo State governorship election, where the Supreme Court judgement did not reflect the decision of voters on ground.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan is currently in a meeting over a possible presidential ambition in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\nThere had been speculations that Jonathan might dump the Peoples Democratic Party to actualise his ambition on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThough tipped to be among those interested in vying for the top office, the former President has refused to make any commitment to it publicly.\n\n\n\nSome of the supporters of the former president stormed his residence in Abuja on Friday, calling on him to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\n\n\nThey wielded placards and banners with inscriptions saying \u2018Goodluck Jonathan must run for president 2023\u2032, \u201cJonathan is our candidate\u2019, among others.\n\n\n\nResponding to them, Jonathan asked Nigerian youths to show greater interest in the nation\u2019s political process.\n\n\n\nThe former President said it was time for youths to take advantage of the \u2018Not Too Young To Run Act\u2019 to participate actively in the electoral process.\n\n\n\nHe said he was aware that they were \u201chere to ask me to declare,\u201d but noted, \u201cI cannot declare because some processes are still ongoing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election, I cannot tell I\u2019m declaring. The political process is ongoing, just watch out. The key role you must play is that Nigeria must get somebody that will carry young people along.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had recently reported how Jonathan rejected some of the conditions given to him by members of the Aso Rock (Presidency) cabal to get the 2023 presidential automatic ticket of the ruling APC.\n\n\n\nOne of the conditions was that the former President must officially defect to the APC with some PDP governors in the South-South and South-East regions.\n\n\n\nSources however told SaharaReporters that he rejected the conditions and told the cabal he didn\u2019t have interest in the 2023 presidency again.\n\n\n\nHis response, it was gathered, embarrassed the cabal members who described the former President as a traitor.\n\nJonathan became Acting President in 2010 when President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua died. He contested in 2011 and won the election to become President.\n\n\n\nHe again contested in 2015 for a second term in office but was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, the incumbent President.",

          "text": "Chris Ngige, minister of labour who is seeking to contest the presidency, says he doesn\u2019t need to resign over section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nHe spoke on Thursday when he featured on Channels Television.\n\nThere has been controversy over the aforementioned section which states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ngige, the section does not apply to him as he falls under the \u2018public officer\u2019 category in the constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe constitution is the grand norm \u2013 the biggest and heaviest of all the laws. Section 137 has given areas of qualifications for presidential candidates. The constitution says public officers should resign one month to election,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue now is \u2018is the minister a public servant\u2019? Yes, I\u2019m a public servant. Go to schedule 5, you\u2019ll see me listed there \u2013 ministers, commissioners, governors, vice-president, president and heads of ministerial bodies.\n\n\u201cThey listed all of us and gave certain things you should not do, because as a public officer, you cannot take two jobs that have executive positions and receive salaries on them; you cannot do business or trade or be a contractor; that area says you can only do farming as a public officer, and inhibits me and others from operating foreign accounts. A public officer is a public servant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also spoke on the N100 million fixed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my party NEC fixed. Whether I\u2019m happy with that or not, that is their own postulation. They have done their calculation; they have done their work. And Abdullahi Adamu, the chairman, is a very serious man if you know him well. He was my colleague in the governors\u2019 forum and he was my colleague in the seventh senate. He\u2019s a very serious-minded person,\u201d Ngige said.\n\n\u201cFor Adamu to say N100 million, he has seen certain things. I was a party official in PDP unfortunately, and a NEC member, so I know the workings of a party. I\u2019m not going to crucify them or say \u2018crucify them\u2019.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a critical example. After the selling of these forms, candidates emerge. When you tell them to contribute to the party, you won\u2019t see them. That\u2019s our experience in PDP, ACN, APC. And they have done the right thing to encourage the young ones that they have 50 percent discount. That\u2019s magnanimous enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was budgeting N50 million \u2014 I and my supporters. But when the thing came out and it\u2019s N100 million, they have started calling me. I have supporters, well-wishers. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\n\nOn why he thinks he qualifies for the presidency, Ngige said his time in the civil service has given him the necessary experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in public service for 40 years. I started work in Lagos in 1981 as a medical officer 1, and rose to become deputy director. I understand the civil service. I have passed through the mills of the public service of Nigeria \u2013 both political party-wise, civil service-wise, legislature, executive at state and national level. I know the problems. I\u2019m in the room,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Second, send a shout-out to Ogheneruemu, my copy editor. She does an excellent job with the newsletter.\n\nSo, how did your week go? I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

As an association we have a clear development plan for ACC Irrua and we are committed to working closely with the state Ministry of Education and Governor\u2019s office as we execute identified projects.\n\n\u201cAs grateful old boys who owe our successes in life to our alma mater, we strongly believe we have a duty to rebuild, protect and sustain the legacy of the founder of ACC Irrua, Rev. Anselm Ojefua. As part of our master plan to help ACC reclaim its status as one of the best secondary schools in Edo and Nigeria we recently completed the institution of a N100 million scholarship endowment fund to make ACC affordable and accessible to all current and future students who wish to attend the school.\n\n\u201cWe built a 500 seat multipurpose hall, A- 6 bed room Corpers lodge, asphalting of the main road from the school gate to the Principal\u2019s office, front and back perimeter fence, rehabilitation of the main gate and construction of a gatehouse, installation of the stature of the founding principal, Rev Father Anselm Ojefua and hiring of ten highly qualified teachers, Installation of internet services , hiring of security guards to protect the school against vandals, purchase of six lawn mowers, supply of boxes of text and exercise books, provision of a projector and several white boards and furnishing of staff room,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe old boys are convinced that our Governor had no foreknowledge of today\u2019s honourees relationship with ACC Irrua when he chose them as worthy lieutenants in his mission to advance all encompassing development in Edo state. This is providence at play and it is marvelous in our sights and we thank Mr. Governor and to our honourees we charge you to continue to be good ambassadors of ACC Irrua.\u201d\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki who was represented by the Secretary to the state government, Osarodion Ogie, Esq. congratulated the awardees noting that the government is proud of all them.\n\nOn the thoughts of the state governor on secondary school education in the state, the SSG said the state government initially put emphasis on basic and technical education to ensure a right foundation is built across the state.\n\n\u201cWe have turned around the Benin Technical College today and before we leave office we want to ensure that we have a technical college in each of the local government area. We have succeeded in Basic Education and now we have stepped up to the secondary education.\n\n\u201cThere are issues over takeover of schools and we have to find a solution how the old boys will collaborate with government to put in place a sustainable system, set up an education foundation because it is not in every case that it is practicable.\n\n\u201cBut as government we invite you to develop a system that will be sustainable and we are ready to partner with you to improve ACC Irrua,\u201d he added.\n\nThere was presentation of awards to Hon.

It was Ayobo and its environs yesterday today it may be the turn of other parts of the state.\n\nNo one is above the law, and Lagos State should not keep quiet in this regard but acts fast.\n\nThe festering crisis in the road transport unionism is uncalled for, and it is the responsibility of the state to call all the parties- Mr.Akinsanya and Alhaji Abiola Istijabah, chairman of the Tricycles Owners and Operators Association of Nigerians , Lagos State chapter to a roundtable talks for amicable settlement.\n\nForceful takeovers of parks is not the way to go, if anything, it will further aggravate the crisis and cause tensions and apprehension that can affect businesses and the activities of law-abiding citizens of the state.\n\nLagos State government should act as an impartial arbiter to resolve the crisis, and the police authorities should warn their officers not to take sides, but to maintain law and order, no matter whose ox is gored . When law enforcement is viewed as taking sides, it will further fuel unnecessary crisis, complicating unresolved matters at hand .\n\nThere is no way the state seen as model of economic development and social progress can continue to play that role if it doesn\u2019t insist on amicable settlement of the feuding parties in the road transport union.\n\nFracas over parks is a tinder box in Lagos, and it can quickly spread out of control.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwoolu has been doing well ever since he came to power in 2019, and nothing should be allowed to derail the train of progress of Lagos he has set in motion.\n\nThe resolution of the crisis should also entail a rapprochement with the national headquarters of the National Union of Road Transport Workers which had already expelled Mr Akinsanya.\n\nAkinsanya seen as a model to some on account of sartorial elegance should continue to inspire youth in that regard, and as a leader of sort, his deposition should be how to deepen tranquility in the state, create more opportunities for members of the union to be economically fulfilled.\n\nSame goes to Alhaji Abiola Istijabah, who according to report is a gentleman,who has also been inspiring in his comportment, and has also empowered thousands members.\n\nThe duo are inspiring and should embrace peace in the state.",

And you do know that this has some impacts on the exchange rate itself. When you allow that to happen, you will have an uncontrollable spiral on the naira. But what managed float means is that we have some measures in place to help control the spiral,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele said the managed float, which allows the CBN to intervene in the market when there is a supply shock, would be in place as long as supply exceeds demand. He said the CBN wants to ensure that the production of excluded items is deepened before the current policy, which \u201cthey do not like\u201d is reversed.\n\nEmefiele appreciated the support of the IMF, especially through special drawing rights (SDR) and advisory but insisted the CBN would lean heavily on \u201chomegrown\u201d solutions as advised by the Fund during its meetings with national economic managers and central banks.\n\n\u201cOur resolutions at the IMF have always suggested that governors should go back to their countries and think of homegrown solutions. Nigeria\u2019s situation is very peculiar, and that is the reason we have always called on the IMF to show understanding. It has, indeed, shown understanding,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe IMF and World Bank provide advice that we work with. But even at some of our private meetings, we realise that there are challenges, leading us to adopt homegrown solutions to address them. We cannot adopt what is being proposed; we cannot adopt a free float of our currency. With the reduction of forex for rice or maize, demand will drop. As it drops, we can adjust the exchange rate. We will continue to engage the IMF and World Bank.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria would surpass the IMF growth projection for Nigeria. In its recent World Economic Outlook, the Fund raised the country\u2019s prospect by 0.7 percentage points to 3.4 per cent on the account of the bullish oil market.",

We are not taking it for granted\u201d, he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDescribing Ugwuanyi as a prayerful man, Bishop Onyia said: \u201cIt is obvious this is part of the strong reasons why this state has been so peaceful. Prayer works; prayer has an answer to everything and because you have devoted your time to pray, God will never allow you to make a mistake at any point particularly in this critical season of making a choice of who comes after you.\n\n\u201cWe are also standing in the place of prayer for you and the whole state and we will continue to pray that God will lead you alright. You have supported us and we are grateful for what you have done\u201d.\n\nUgwuanyi after inaugurating the hospital took a tour of the facility, in the company of Bishop Onyia, his wife, Nneka, the management team, the member representing Enugu East/Isi-Uzo Federal Constituency, Hon. Prince Cornelius Nnaji, the member representing Enugu North Constituency, Hon.

However, the process that we can do at the moment, the procurement that we can do at the moment, to ensure that there is immediate irrigation, water projects to ensure that there is clean water provided for the people and that other sites, will begin the remediation process,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nThe minister explained that the process was being carried out in stages, with ten polluting locations having been cleaned up thus far.\n\nAccording to Abdullahi, he updated the President on the project\u2019s development, and the President urged the ministry to guarantee that the project was given enough attention.\n\nWhen questioned if the current administration still intends to complete the cleanup process during its mandate, the minister replied that while it is speeding up the process, there are no indicators that all phases would be completed before Buhari takes office next year.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing miraculous about our approach to the cleanup operations; it is going to be a very pragmatic, practicable and quick-win solution. First, like I told you earlier, is to ensure that there is a multi-stakeholder agreement in terms of what we\u2019re supposed to do, where we\u2019re going.\n\n\u201cThen secondly, we\u2019ve taken very strong steps to address the concerns bordering on procurement, on project management, on fund management and so on, so that all stakeholders will be on board. So, I can assure you that if these issues are resolved, within the next couple of weeks, we should be focused on immediate procurement processes that will ensure that the projects are implemented as at when due.\n\n\u201cHowever, they are phased projects, we do not envisage that we can finish the entire project within the lifetime of this government.

          "text": "By Emmanuel Obisue\n\nPresident of the World Bank Group, David Malpass has asked the Federal Government to have a rethink on its policy on fuel subsidy, stating that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled into other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass noted this on Wednesday at a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United States.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Nigerian Senate last week approved N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nAccording to Malpass, generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system. Thus, he reiterated the need for the country to do away with the multiple exchange rate system, which he said is \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there was a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\n\n\u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help,\u201d he noted.\n\nMalpass further noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows. He urged the Nigerian Government to improve to help the country and its people move forward.\n\n\u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into non Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy,\u201d he added while commenting on the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe World Bank had in November 2021 warned Nigeria not to delay any further in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy.",

It demonstrates the power of science and innovation for health. Even so, there is an urgent need to develop more and better tools to save lives and drive progress towards a malaria-free world.\u201d\n\nAccording to the WHO, these findings paved the way for its historic recommendation of October 2021 for the expanded use of RTS,S among children living in settings with moderate to high malaria transmission.\n\nIf widely deployed, the agency estimates that the vaccine could save the lives of an additional 40,000 to 80,000 African children each year.\n\nIt revealed that no fewer than $155 million has been secured from Gavi \u2013 the Vaccine Alliance to support the introduction, procurement, and delivery of the malaria vaccine for Gavi-eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWHO said its guidance was available to countries as they consider whether and how to adopt RTS,S as an additional tool to reduce child illness and deaths from malaria.\n\nRTS,S is a first-generation vaccine that could be complemented in the future by other vaccines with similar or higher efficacy, and WHO welcomes progress in the development of R21/Matrix-M and other malaria vaccine candidates in early clinical development.\n\nThe successful completion of clinical trials for these vaccines, according to the agency, will be important to assess their safety and efficacy profiles.\n\nWHO also welcomes the news from BioNTech, manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, that it aims to develop a malaria vaccine using mRNA technology.",

We shouldn\u2019t be waiting for them to attack. Why can\u2019t we go after them?\u201d\n\nDisturbed by the incessant attacks on innocent residents and invasion of communities in parts of the county, President Buhari met with the various heads of security agencies on Thursday.\n\nAt the meeting, according to Monguno, the President expressed worry over the present situation and directed that all abducted persons still in captivity be rescued without delay.\n\nIn further advice to Governor El-Rufai, the NSA said, \u201cEven if they say we know where they (terrorists) are, that in itself is already a problem.\n\n\u201cOnce you say it, whether it is true or false, the person who has your people in captivity will move to another location.

Fico accused Kiska of \u201cmaking his money from usury on impoverished people,\u201d \u201cmisusing his charity for political goals,\u201d and having \u201cclose ties to Scientology\u201d during an exceptionally acrimonious campaign.\n\nFico and Kali\u00e1k allegedly acquired unlawful access to tax documents in 2017, and the prime minister, then in his third term, began referring to President Kiska as a \u201ctax cheat.\u201d\n\nHowever, the 2018 murders of investigative journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak, 28, and his fianc\u00e9e Martina Kunirov\u00e1 brought Fico\u2019s premiership and government to an end. The release of thousands of private messages between Kuciak\u2019s alleged killers and police, judges, and ruling-coalition politicians galvanized voters, propelling the anti-corruption Ordinary People movement to power in 2020.",

          "title": "N100m Presidential Form Meant to Shut Out Unserious Aspirants, APC Women Leader Says",
          "text": "Following public outrage over the high cost of nomination forms for aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC), the ruling party on Thursday explained that the fee was pegged at the rate needed to lock out unserious contenders.\n\nAPC\u2019s defence of the price of its nominations forms, which was announced Wednesday, came as Chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP) and senator for Kano South, Senator Kabiru Gaya, expressed confidence in Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy. Gaya said, unlike the moneybags, Osinbajo\u2019s popularity would facilitate the pooling of his supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee for his presidential bid.\n\nHowever, National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and former Governor of Cross River State, Chief Clement Ebri, condemned the high nomination cost for elective offices announced by APC.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, also criticised APC for \u201ccorrupting democracy\u201d with the high nomination fee, saying the N100 million fixed for its presidential nomination form \u201crightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged on Thursday that President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, was under intense pressure from a section of the northern elite to run for president in 2023.\n\nThe ruling party had during its 11th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Abuja pegged its presidential nomination form at N100 million, governorship at N50 million, Senate at N20 million, House of Representatives at N10 million, and House of Assembly at N2 million.\n\nAPC National Women Leader, Beta Edu, featuring on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Arise News Channel said the high rate of the ruling party\u2019s nomination forms was to curtail the activities of persons with jokey ambitions. Edu said the APC National Working Committee (NWC) had consciously fixed the rate as part of a mechanism to ensure only serious aspirants were on the ballot.\n\nShe said the ruling party could not afford to waste time, especially considering the fact that it was working in line with the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nEdu stated, \u201cEverywhere around the world, running for elections has never been cheap and the party must be able to have means to guard several other issues that may arise. You find people who are not interested in running for elections just standing up, picking up forms and just waiting to constitute a kind of barrier or put a stud in the entire process as it goes on.\n\n\u201cThese are not things that we want to see as a party. We are the ruling party, the largest party in Africa, a party where if you pick their nomination form and you are the candidate, the probability of you becoming the elected person for that position is almost hundred per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot afford to dabble or joke around or gamble around. We want only serious people who are interested in running and representing different persons to run.\u201d\n\nEdu claimed the cost of forms for House of Assembly was fair.\n\nShe stated, \u201cFor all we care, N1.5 million for a House of Assembly nomination form is fair to the general population. It\u2019s very fair and for women it\u2019s free, for the disabled, it is free; for young people, it is 40 per cent off, that\u2019s really very fair.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, going for the other positions, we know what it was before and what it is now and we are trying to prevent certain persons who sometimes are not the members of the party. They just get their way in or they\u2019re being used as syndicate to pick up forms at the beginning to constitute a kind of stud in the way of the whole electoral process and they pull the party backwards.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain her definition of fairness with regard to the ruling party\u2019s high nomination fee in a country where over 98 per cent of the population did not have N500, 000 in their bank accounts, the APC women leader stated that running for elective office was not an all-comers affair.\n\nEdu said, \u201cLet me say this and very clearly, coming to run for a governorship election is not an all-comers affair. Governorship election is serious business, for you to run through all the local governments, consult people, reach out to people and, indeed, be able to campaign through the local governments requires some good amount of resources. And when you make up your mind that you want to run, you should be able to prepare adequately for that race.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, there are many ways for young people to generate funding for elections. It must not be your money and they are not paying the same amount others are paying.\u201d\n\nOn rising disunity within the party, Edu said as part of the reconciliation committee, headed by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, she believed his view that most of the crises in the states were fuelled by ego clash between serving and former governors.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe went through all the states in Nigeria and we understood the issues and concerns about unity or some disagreements among members of the party and, of course, like the chairman clearly stated yesterday (Wednesday), if we work together, we can to overcome it soon.\u201d\n\nShe said, as the party moved closer to the elections, more aggrieved members would be reconciled.\n\nOsinbajo Popular Enough to Pool Donations to Raise N100m, Supporters Insist\n\nMeanwhile, Gaya said Osinbajo was popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee with ease.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Gaya said consultations by members of various support groups, eminent political leaders, and citizens, too numerous to mention, culminated in his decision to lead the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 group.\n\nHe noted that for the vice president, the race was not about personal ambition, but a positive response to a popular call from a citizen-driven mobilisation that began without input from him or his office. The lawmaker stressed that people from other parties and even millions of non-partisan citizens, who did not belong to any political party, had strong interest and involvement with the campaign for Osinbajo\u2019s candidature.\n\nGaya stressed that his specific assignment here was to lead a process of recalibration of all pro-Osinbajo forces towards electoral victory on the platform of APC. He said without doubt, all knowledgeable people in the country could attest to the qualities and competence of Osinbajo.\n\nGaya noted that his chosen method redefined presidential declarations in Nigeria, adding that the vice president clearly signalled that noble citizens had no need to descend into gutters. No touts were hired by anyone and his message effectively reverberated across the entire country and the Diaspora, he stated.\n\nAccording to Gaya, \u201cEven an internal issue of the price of our party\u2019s nomination form is being deliberately misinterpreted in some circles, when we feel confident that, unlike moneybags, our truly populist candidate is popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations and raise such money with ease.\n\n\u201cJust one youth group with TPP, the Progressive Group alone, says that they can raise N100 million with rough voluntary contributions of N10, 000 each by 10, 000 of their supporters, who are keen about seeing a better future.\n\n\u201cOur populist mathematics is flawless and very strong; moneybags within or outside APC will only lose their dollars in any contest against the people\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Gaya said, unlike other political parties, records show that neither the APC presidential ticket nor its vice president\u2019s slot had ever been won by throwing money around, but by populist endorsements from the north and south.\n\nHe said the TPP noted the fear of the people\u2019s genuine power had made some elements to resort to heightened propaganda in the past few days.\n\nGaya added, \u201cWe will not descend low to play gutter politics and we have continued to warn our supporters against involvement in insults and vilification. We are democrats, we believe in uniting people and in submitting ourselves and competing ideas to the people\u2019s evaluation and decisions through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain emphasised that the popular forces behind Osinbajo feared no foe and hated no one, saying they are focused without compromise on the unity, progress and development of Nigeria and would not descend into gutter fights with any person or group.\n\nLawan Under Pressure to Join Presidential Race\n\nIndications emerged on Thursday that the senate president was under intense pressure to contest for president in 2023. The ruling party released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections, but maintained sealed lips on the issue of zoning.\n\nAlthough, following the emergence of Adamu as National Chairman of the party at the March 26 convention, observers believed it was an indication that the ruling party would zone its presidency to the south.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, had said that the party was yet to take any decision on the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that some elements within the northern elite were mounting pressure on Lawan to join the presidential race.\n\nThe source said, \u201cYes, he is under intense pressure to run for president. Some northern leaders are making the moves, asking him to run. It\u2019s so serious. But it is not certain yet. It\u2019s an option he\u2019s still considering.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, two businessmen from Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, have promised to obtain presidential nomination forms for Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Kalu, and Lawan. The businessmen disclosed this in a statement issued on Thursday and signed by Mr. Ukaegbu James and Mr. Nnanna Kalu.\n\nThey said they were convinced that with their track record, managerial skills, experience, and leadership acumen, both Kalu and Lawan had the competence to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to drive the economy. James and Kalu were of the opinion that APC needed a unifier with deep knowledge of the country\u2019s multi-ethnic, lingual and religious settings.\n\nAyu Tackles APC over Outrageous Nomination Fee, Extends Sale, Submission of Forms to Accommodate Defectors\n\nPDP extended the sale of its nominations forms to Friday, to accommodate some APC defectors, like Senator Babba Kaita and his supporters. This was to enable them purchase any form of their choice for the 2023 general election.\n\nCommenting on the high price of the APC nomination forms, Ayu, in a statement by his media aide, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said, \u201cNigerians can all see what the APC is: a fragmented alliance put together to capture power and inflict maximum pain on Nigerians, including their own members.\u201d\n\nAyu urged Nigerians to recall how in 2014, President Muhammadu Buhari and leader of APC had told Nigerians then that he borrowed N27 million to buy his nomination form.\n\n\u201cThe same man, as leader of his party, has now sanctioned the sale of the same forms at N100 million! I am told that\u2019s an increase of 370 per cent,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nHe added, \u201cBut in 2014, the PDP was in power and the economy was still booming. The incompetent APC presidency has now run the economy aground, making Nigeria the \u2018Poverty Capital of the World.\u2019\n\n\u201cHow then can impoverished APC aspirants buy nominations at such prohibitively high costs? And yet, only recently he preached \u2018Equal Opportunity\u2019 to them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman of PDP said, \u201cBy this latest insensitive action, the APC has disenfranchised thousands of her youths, and dashed the hopes of millions of Nigerian youths who applauded President Buhari when he signed the Not Too Young To Run Bill into law in 2018. It is most insensitive, and mind-boggling. In fact, all those buying the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed, \u201cWe, the PDP, are different. We are a mass movement for the Nigerian people. This is why our nomination fees are soft and democratic. When you compare us with the APC, the difference is clear. This is why we must return to power to save Nigerians from this insensitive government.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former governor of Cross River State, Clement Ebri, condemned the high cost of forms for Expression of Interest and nomination for elective offices announced by the ruling party. Ebri said it vitiated the principles upon which APC campaigned and was voted into power.\n\nHe called on the NWC of the party to rethink the party\u2019s position on the matter.\n\nEbri, in a statement issued yesterday, said some people might have argued that the reason for the exorbitant cost of nomination forms was simply to prune the number of contenders, or to delineate the pretenders from the contenders, saying, \u201cThen I think that argument is flawed.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said true party men and women should be concerned that the party, which was founded on the values and ideals of progressive philosophy, would make pre-qualification for elective offices \u2013 at state and national level \u2013 the exclusive preserve of party members with either great personal wealth or that have unlimited access to other sources of funding.\n\nEbri added, \u201cWith reference to the recent announcement by the APC concerning the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for various elective positions, the APC owes it to itself and the teeming numbers of Nigerians who voted it into power for two consecutive terms, to remain a party of true progressives and a true party of progressives.\n\n\u201cThe current party position on the cost of forms for Expression of Interest and Nomination for elective offices appears to vitiate the very principles upon which the party campaigned and was voted into power.\n\n\u201cThe danger this poses to the party is that many prospective and otherwise eminently qualified office seekers that do not possess enormous personal wealth will in every practical sense, be precluded from seeking party nomination, regardless of the depth and breadth of their popular support.\u201d\n\nEbri said there were ample objective and progressive criteria, such as integrity, experience, character, political antecedents, empathy, intelligence, goodwill, etc, which could be employed to enable the emergence of genuinely qualified candidates.\n\nHe said it was a known fact that personal wealth was not the yardstick of assessment that enabled Buhari to emerge as standard-bearer of the party in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe party chieftain noted that a comparative analysis of the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms in APC and that of the main opposition PDP showed that a member of APC with governorship aspiration would not only be spending more than twice what his/her counterparts in the opposition are, but would also be spending more to vie for governorship office than the opposition candidates vying for the office of president.\n\nEbri stressed that as laudable as the concession of 50 per cent reduction for youths might seem, it was worthy of note that the youth in the APC that were vying for governorship would still be paying more than their opposition counterparts.\n\nHe added that youths vying for the presidential ticket would be paying more than what the opposition presidential aspirants were paying for nomination. The party chieftain wondered if APC had inadvertently been made a party of the wealthy by the wealthy for the wealthy.\n\nMeanwhile, in an apparent move to accommodate defectors from APC, PDP extended the sale and submission of its nomination forms for the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cAfter a thorough consideration of various issues and concerns in the party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has further adjusted its Timetable and Schedule of Activities to extend the closing dates for the purchase of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2023 general elections to Friday, April 22, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the reviewed timetable, the last day for the submission of already completed Forms has been extended to Monday, April 25, 2022\n\n\u201cConsequently, the following new dates have been fixed for the screening as well as Appeals arising from the screening of aspirants for various positions:\n\n\u201cState House of Assembly and National Assembly: Wednesday, April 27, 2022; Governorship: Thursday, April 28, 2022; Presidential: Friday, April 29, 2022. Appeals on all screening exercised: Monday, May 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the updated timetable, the three-man Ad Hoc Ward Congress has been fixed for Saturday, April 30, 2022 while the Local Government Area National Delegates Congresses will now hold on Thursday, May 5, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cAll dates for primary election into various positions remain the same. Please, note that all duly completed State Assembly Forms are to be submitted at the various states secretariat of the party.\n\n\u201cAll aspirants, critical stakeholders and party members should be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nOzekhome: Buhari, APC Corrupting Democracy\n\nOzekhome accused the president and the ruling party of debasing democracy in a statement yesterday titled, \u201cPresident Buhari and the APC are corrupting democracy.\u201d\n\nThe statement was in response to Wednesday\u2019s announcement by the ruling party fixing various high fees for its nomination forms, which had outraged many Nigerians.\n\nOzekhome stated, \u201cThe staggering sum of N100 million fixed by the APC NEC for its presidential nomination form has rightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country. The APC had fixed N30 million for the \u2018expression of interest form\u2019 and N70 million for the \u2018nomination form\u2019, making a total of N100 million.\n\n\u201cThe party hopes to rake in N1.5 billion from the 15 aspirants that have so far declared interest in the presidential race. By this singular act, the APC has shown a shocking insatiable bacchanalian propensity to corrupt democracy, democratic ethos, and also scam the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of this exercise lies not just in the abominable fee prescribed, but more in the party\u2019s pretentious mantra of fighting corruption, using a well orchestrated and carefully oiled Hitler\u2019s Goebel\u2019s propagandist machinery of dubious pedigree. It is the more abhorrent when we realise that this is miles apart from (indeed more than double) the price fixed by the party\u2019s whipping child, the opposition PDP, which has fixed its at N40million (N5 million) for the expression of interest; and N35 million for the nomination form. The N100m is also over 100 per cent of the N40 million fixed by the same APC for the 2018, presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammed Buhari and the APC have, by this singular act, exhibited a very odious and unpleasant example of how not to fight corruption. They have managed to convince Nigerians that politics is, indeed, the art of grand deception, double-dealing, duplicity, beguilement, sham and self-contradiction. They have justified the clich\u00e9 that diplomacy is the clever art of telling a person to go to hell in such a way that he actually eagerly looks forward to the journey.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Military Not Doing Enough to End Insecurity Despite Logistics Provided, Buhari Says",
          "text": "In a clear indictment, a disappointed President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, told the security agencies that they were not doing enough to end the security challenges in the country, despite enormous logistics provided by his administration.\n\nBuhari frowned on the fact that his previous directives to the military to end insecurity in the country had not yielded much results.\n\nHe directed all the operational and intelligence agencies to rescue unhurt, all persons kidnapped by terrorists, including those in the recent Kaduna-bound train.\n\nThat was as the the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, explained the basis for heavy security presence in the South-east, saying the police would no longer tolerate attacks on their men.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), expressed the president\u2019s reservation while speaking with newsmen on Thursday after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja, presided by Buhari.\n\nMonguno said there was no way the president would be happy, when people were being killed on a daily basis. He said the last straw was the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which led to the death of some passengers, with scores kidnapped.\n\nThe NSA added that the president was of the belief that enough was not being done by the security agencies, despite the logistics being provided.\n\nMonguno stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a sitting of the National Security Council, a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was presided over by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This meeting is the first for 2022 and the meeting deliberated on several issues, at the strategic and operational levels, as well as other issues that are broader.\n\n\u201cIn his opening remarks, he (Buhari) spoke about his sadness in respect of the recent developments in the country, the recent security challenges we\u2019ve had, in particular, the incident in which several Nigerians lost their lives and many more have been taken into captivity by criminals and bandits.\n\n\u201cIf ten times something happens, ten times (we) will be unhappy and as the leader of this country, the father of the nation, he has to express his displeasure. You know, he is just at the managerial level, he gives us instructions.\n\n\u201cAnd his displeasure is probably, because he feels enough is not being done. So, we can\u2019t put this thing on his shoulders completely. He\u2019s at the strategic level, he takes the decisions. But when these things become endless, he has to express concern. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed all the operational and intelligence elements to rescue these innocent people immediately and unhurt. This is the basis, which other issues were discussed. Obviously, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the service chiefs, as well as the Inspector-General of Police, all briefed the President on the occurrences in their respective organisations.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed that the president alone could not be blamed for the insecurity in the country, saying his part is to make strategic decisions, which the NSA said he has been doing even though he said that the military has secured the nation\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cI submitted a memo to council and my recommendations are being looked into by the president. My recommendations are wide ranging and they touch on all aspects of security, starting with the level of security of our land borders, as well as within the country itself.\n\n\u201cIn terms of securing the nation, we\u2019ve recorded a lot of successes in the maritime domain and obviously, the problem now has shifted to our borders from outside. As a result of that, there\u2019s a need for us to configure how we\u2019re going to make our borders more secure because of the threats coming from outside the borders.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the surrendering of Boko Haram elements, especially in the North-east, had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country, as the threat had shifted to the Northwest and North Central.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, the issue in the North-east, there\u2019s been a lot of improvement and that has been attested to by the governor of Borno State during our last National Council of State meeting. But, nevertheless, the fact that the North-east is becoming much more stable, more and more people from the terrorists have started surrendering to government, has not really brought to an end the way we would want the situation in the country, because the threat is now shifted from the North-east, to the North-west and to the North-central, and this threat has to be contained.\n\n\u201cIt has to be contained collectively by both the armed forces as well as the constabulary forces: the Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, but the intelligence agencies also have been directed to enhance the acquisition of intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society was willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity would linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe present situation in the country calls for collective effort by all, not just those that have been charged with the responsibility of physically securing the country, the most important thing for now is acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence and I need to make it very clear.\n\n\u201cI have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\n\n\u201cA lot of lives are being lost, the president is not happy about this situation, he\u2019s made it very clear. The first assignment he\u2019s given to the security agencies, especially, the armed forces and the police is to rescue those that are in captivity, not just those that were captured during the last train incident, but those that have been in captivity in other parts of the country. That is the first thing that has to be done.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, my memo dwells on the prevailing situation within the security outfits; their needs, their challenges and the President has decided to look into these things and might as well call for another meeting in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn why the country had not deplored technology to tackle the menace of terrorism and banditry, Monguno said effort was being made to deploy technology to tackle insecurity but submitted that the required technology was expensive and would take time to acquire.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe first question has to do with, why is it so difficult to deploy technology. One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things, since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have, but the plight is that they are inadequate, so, to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nOn alleged sabotage within the military in the fight against terrorism, Monguno said the possibility of having rogue elements could not be ruled out.\n\nAsked whether he would draw a correlation between the threats from the border and the level of insecurity in the country and whether there was any suggestion that foreigners might have been responsible for the insecurity in the country, he said, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact; it\u2019s not a conjecture. I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of efforts to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that counsel is looking into.\u201d\n\nThe IGP addressed the question of massive police presence in South-east. Baba said, \u201cI think the question is about deployment. Deployment is being determined by a lot of issues or yardsticks.\n\n\u201cJust like two states may have different number of local governments, so also there can be different number of formations in that state or in that formation. We have formations, we have commands, we have zonal commands and so forth. So, deployment should not be based on either size or number of persons or threat assessment tool in that place.\n\n\u201cIt is all about how you police a particular place based on the number of people you have, based also on your ability to gather that manpower. If your command, for instance, Kaduna command has, let\u2019s say 3000 personnel. For now, I know already that 3,000 personnel cannot take care of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWhat we normally do is to deploy from other states to come and complement the efforts of Kaduna by what we are calling, let\u2019s say, special duty. We can take from states, where we feel the threat is not as eminent or as bad as what they have in Kaduna, so that you can complement Kaduna. So, also you can complement Imo, Anambra. It\u2019s based on your threat analysis.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Baba, has warned that the police high command would no longer tolerate incessant killing of police officers in the country especially, the South-east.\n\nHe condemned the recent spate of attacks on police officers, facilities and other police operational assets across the country.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, consequently, ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and other operations launched with the aim of flushing out criminal elements, who hide under the guise of aggrieved citizens to perpetrate criminal acts.\n\n\u201cThe IG warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the IG reiterated the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property, while stressing that it was vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives, in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Thursday defended the apex bank\u2019s managed-float exchange rate system, stressing that it was adopted to address the peculiar challenges the country faces.\n\nIn addition, Emefiele, reiterated that he was focused on his job and remains committed to supporting the fiscal authorities in ensuring that the country surpasses the 3.4 per cent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2022, that had been predicted for Nigeria by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThis was just as the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, on Thursday, expressed optimism that once the Dangote Refinery becomes functional, the burden of petrol subsidy would be lifted from the country.\n\nThey both spoke during an interview with journalists on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United States of America.\n\nThe President of the World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass, had on Wednesday, said there was need for Nigeria to do away with its multiple exchange rate system, which according to him was often, \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there were a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\nMalpass, had also faulted the country\u2019s petrol subsidy policy, which is expected to gulp N4 trillion this year.\n\nBut responding to a question on the call for a single exchange rate window, the CBN Governor stressed that, \u201cdifferent countries have different challenges and must develop solutions that would help address their challenges.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBoth the IMF and World Bank are our prime development banks, and we have receive support from them at different times in resolving some of our economic challenges, particularly bothering on finance.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s situation is very peculiar and that is why we have continued to engage the IMF and World bank to show understanding in our local problems. And they are indeed showing understanding.\n\n\u201cYes they want us to freely float the exchange rate and you do know that this will have some impact on the exchange rate itself in the sense that when you allow that to happen, you will have some uncontrollable spiral in the country\u2019s exchange rate.\u201d\n\nAccording to Emefiele, what the CBN had been doing was to ensure that, \u201ceven as we run the managed float, there should be some interventions put in place to really control exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHe, noted that as long as the demand for forex exceeds the supply, the challenge would persist, saying, \u201cwe are doing everything possible to restructure the base of the economy through some of the policies that we have put in place to deepen the production of goods in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEmefiele, pointed out that the central bank would continue to make the IMF and World Bank understand the peculiar situations that Nigeria faces and how to tackle them to see the progress of the economy.\n\nResponding to a question on the commendation received by the IMF over the positive momentum in Nigeria\u2019s non-oil sector, Emefiele said: \u201cI am happy that the IMF and World Bank are seeing efforts to drive non-oil exports. Before now, we have always relied on earnings from crude oil as well as foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to look at how to improve non-oil exports, particularly through export proceeds and so on. I am happy that other people outside Nigeria are seeing these efforts and this means we will continue to do more to ensure that we really deepen this and fund imports with proceeds from exports and with less reliance on the central bank.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the global concerns about surging inflation, Emefiele said: \u201cI must say that in the last two years, the CBN has adopted price stability that is conducive to growth. This means that generally, that we have been tightening, but again in some priority sectors of the economy, like agriculture and manufacturing, we have adopted somewhat of accommodative monetary policy stance and this is why you can see that people can raise 10-year loan with two years moratorium at singe interest rate for agriculture and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThat is why you can see that whereas inflation is coming down gradually, the output, which is growth is increasing at the same time, which is a good result for Nigeria. Consequently today, as a result of global challenges we face, the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the main issues is rising energy and commodity prices which has led to acceleration in the rate of inflation and at the same time dampening growth globally.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying is that we are tightening generally, the banks can confirm this, but at the same time, we are adopting some of accommodation to support growth through some priority sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated that he remains focused on his job as a central banker, assuring the central bank would continue to support the fiscal authorities to ensure the country records positive economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on our job and we are happy that we are playing our role in supporting the Nigerian economy. We have been on this since 2015, when inflation rate was almost at 19 per cent, it came down to almost about 11 per cent because of the increase in energy prices as well as electricity prices.\n\n\u201cIt went up to almost 18 per cent again and we have managed to bring it down to below 16 per cent. I believe we would continue to rein in inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, we are doing everything possible to support the fiscal authorities by putting in place facilities to support households, businesses and others at single-digit interest rate and that has helped in accelerating output and we feel delighted that even at this meetings, amongst other countries, the IMF has held a positive position about Nigeria\u2019s growth prospect at 3.4 per cent and we believe that all things being equal we are going to surpass it. So, what we are doing is to continue to focus on our job and nothing more,\u201d he explained.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmed, while responding to Malpass comment that the country should reconsider the huge payments to petrol subsidy, said: \u201cThe decision to remove the subsidy was deferred. We have information from Aliko Dangote himself that the refinery would become functional by the end of this year, and we are hoping that it walks out that way because it will be in our interest. It means now that we can have the refined products locally as opposed to importing them, it will definitely reduce the cost on the citizens.\u201d\n\nObinna Chima in Washington DC",

You will also agree with me that his chosen method redefines presidential declarations in Nigeria; he has clearly signaled that noble citizens have no need to descend into gutters \u2013 no touts were hired by anyone and his message effectively reverberated across the entire country and the Diaspora.\u201d\n\nOn funding to obtain the vice president\u2019s nomination form, he said: \u201cWe feel confident that unlike moneybags, our truly populist candidate is popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations and raise such money with ease.\n\n\u201cJust one youth group with TPP, the Progressive Group alone say that they can raise N100m with rough voluntary contributions of N10, 000 each by 10, 000 of their supporters who are keen about seeing a better future.\n\n\u201cOur populist mathematics is flawless and very strong; moneybags within or outside APC will only lose their dollars in any contest against the people\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cUnlike the history of some other political parties, records show that neither APC presidential ticket nor its VP slot had ever been won by throwing money around but by populist endorsement from north and south.\u201d",
