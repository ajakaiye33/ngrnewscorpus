          "text": "Some men and officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have been lamenting how the anti-narcotics agency, through its harmonisation and promotion exercise, has allegedly denied them promotion for about 20 years.\n\nThey said some of their colleagues recruited even five to eight years later have been promoted up to two times or more.\n\nSome sources within the agency told SaharaReporters that following the persistent cries of the aggrieved officers, the current leadership of the agency upon assumption of the office promised to clear the backlog of promotion arrears and correct the distortion of seniority ranks to instil discipline among the workforce in the agency.\n\n\n\nTo fulfil its promise, the management of the NDLEA on February 3, 2021, inaugurated a 7-man harmonisation expertise committee headed by Col. Yakubu Bako (rtd) who also serves as Special Adviser to the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CCEO) of the agency.\n\n\n\nThe committee was mandated to correct all issues with delayed promotion, and stagnation and produce a proper, accurate and credible seniority roll of all personnel of the agency.\n\nBut sources within the agency said that upon the release of its report, there were more complaints and outrage among officers and men of the agency as the Committee reportedly failed to do justice to the assignment given to it in accordance with the terms of reference in the circular upon its inauguration.\n\n\u201cIt was discovered that the Committee members had gone on to carry out a lopsided harmonisation that further placed the most recently recruited officers with political connections ahead of their seniors who had been stagnated for more than a decade before they were employed in the agency.\n\n\u201cSome members of the committee themselves also secured proper placements for themselves as well as their alliance but failed to do the same for less fortunate other old officers within the system. This further deepened the bad blood in the agency as officers continued to feel disillusioned,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nFollowing more complaints and widespread condemnation of the harmonisation committee\u2019s report by the long-serving officers who said they have only enjoyed single promotion whereas their juniors who were employed less than a decade ago enjoyed proper placement with two promotions, the CCEO, Brig-Gen. Buba Marina, through a circular with ref NDLEA/CCEO/45/VOL.VII, dated July 6, 2021, inaugurated a Review\n\nCommittee headed by the SA, Otunba Lanre Ipinmisho and five others to X-ray the alleged lopsided harmonisation.\n\n\n\nAlso on the committee were the Chairman of the Harmonisation Committee, Col. Yakubu Bako (rtd) and Head of Statistics and Records, Saidu Daniel, as observers.\n\n\n\nThe circular mandated the review committee to look into allegations arising from the harmonisation exercise including \u201cjunior officers who by reason of harmonisation have unjustifiably become senior to their superiors; officers who failed promotion examinations thrice but passed and were promoted at the fourth attempt in 2019 and whose next promotion should have been 2022 but promoted to higher ranks.\n\n\n\n\u201cInappropriate appointment of effective dates of promotion thereby conferring undue advantage; officers who were inadvertently omitted or overlooked, in the promotion exercise; officers who should have reached their promotable bar but without additional qualification have been promoted to higher ranks and any other act of omission or commission in the conduct of the exercise causing dissension among officers and me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe review committee was mandated to make recommendations as considered appropriate and submit its report within four weeks from the date of inauguration.\n\n\n\nThe committee chairman then called on all the aggrieved officers to submit their petitions or complaints to be addressed but one year after its inauguration, the outcome of the review exercise is yet to see the light of day.\n\n\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cThese have consequently raised a lot of confusion and concerns in the minds of officers who have spent most of their service years in committed service and sacrifice to our dear nation, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to print out that NDLEA is no stranger to harmonisation expertise as the officers of the agency have once enjoyed harmonisation since the inception of the elitist organisation. The first one was done in the year 2001 by the then Chairman/Chief Executive, a retired SSS Director, Alhaji Lafiaji, of which officers were properly placed on the rank commensurate with their years in service depending on their qualifications at points of entry. It was a widely acclaimed successful exercise as it was done strictly in adherence with civil service rule.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters was informed that the current frustration among the ageing workforce was further heightened when rumours filtered through about an alleged compilation of names for promotion exercise which was alleged to have been for the highest bidders.\n\n\n\nSome of the sources said they investigated the veracity of the claim and found that a circular for notification of the promotion exercise was published along with a list of names of candidates considered eligible.\n\n\n\nSome of the shortlisted officers allegedly paid a certain amount of money to some of the administrative staff who had shortlisted the candidates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis new development was greeted with widespread condemnation as the pending report of the Harmonisation review committee had not been published and issues concerning distorted seniority list were still pending,\u201d a source said.\n\n\n\nThe sources told SaharaReporters that some candidates shortlisted for the 2022 promotion had recently enjoyed promotion already whereas others who had submitted memoranda to the review committee for consideration for proper placement were yet to be attended to.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo wonder the alleged fraudulent promotion exercise was suspended within 48 hours in a circular titled Re: List of Eligible Officers for 2022 Promotion Examinations CSA to CSN with reference number NDLEA/CON/SUB1/VOL.III/146.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is sad to note that while the CCEO, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa seems poised to correct all inherited abnormalities in the once moribund agency, forces among its management who are fast approaching retirement are determined to frustrate all efforts made by the Chairmen so as to protect their interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe sources further alleged that some of the administrative staff in charge of posting as well as training and promotion \u201chave recruited cronies of drug barons, politicians, as well as their family members and, are determined to position them in the helm of affairs of the agency well ahead of their own retirement.\n\nNDLEA Scandal by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese ones now enjoy special treatment upon their recruitment, training and deployment as they are posted to sensitive beats such as international airports, seaports as well as other specialised outposts and special formations without consideration for expertise or experience which such assignments require.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe sources expressed worries that with the current situation of things in NDLEA including \u201cmismanagement of funds, distortion of seniority list, corruption and widespread nepotism being witnessed, the agency may have been positioned by strong forces within its workforce to take Nigeria back to its dark days far worse than it was before the inception.\u201d\n\nWhen SaharaReporters called the Spokesperson for the NDLEA, Mr Femi Babafemi, he said 75 percent of the agency's workforce had been promoted.\n\nHe said, \"It is an issue that has been taken care of in the past. The agency last year promoted over 75 percent of its workforce. There is no way you can promote 100 percent, and these are the same people that have been stagnated for years and they have channels of making their grievances known if they think there are grievances.\n\n\"A panel was set up to look at that.\"\n\nOn the report of the harmonisation review committee which is said to have not been submitted after one year, he said, \"The information is wrong. The panel has submitted its report and the report is under consideration.\"\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the aggrieved officers are aware that the committee has submitted its review report, he said, \"But they were aware that they needed to channel their grievances to a panel, why wouldn't they be aware? I'm not aware that there is anybody stagnated.\"\n\nHowever, one of the sources insisted that nothing has changed.\n\n\n\n\"As I speak with you, there is no new development. There is no memo to the effect that the Harmonisation Review Committee has submitted its report, nor has there been any circular informing the aggrieved officers of their due promotion or consideration of their complaints,\" the source said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In fact, rather than act on the complaints of the aggrieved officers, the agency has started victimising some of them. Some of them have been invited to headquarters for disciplinary processes while some who were supposed to be redeployed to another place primary assignment have been reversed. They are only using propaganda to confuse the general public while some of the affected officers are almost dying.\"\n\n",

Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian tech ecosystem groans under rising inflation and fuel price",
          "text": "Nigerian consumers, who are among the poorest in the world, are miserable because they are increasingly required to pay more money to feed, move around, or be comfortable in their houses due to rising food prices, fuel prices, and bad power supply.\n\nJust last week, inflation in Nigeria rose to 18.6% in June 2022, according to the National Bureau of Statistics\u2019s (NBS) Consumer Price Index (CPI). This inflation, the highest since 2017, is powered by the high cost of diesel and gas, rising prices of food items, and the Russia-Ukraine war which drove up the prices of imported food items such as wheat. But it is not only consumers that are crumbling under the weight of the high cost of living, the businesses serving them are also having a hard time staying afloat during this period.\n\nCaught in the middle of all of this is an Abeokuta-based online food delivery startup, EatUp. EatUp, which started operations in 2020, serves students and the fast-growing working millennials and middle-class population of Ogun state, southwest of Nigeria, who seek to live a convenient life outside Lagos, the centre of economic activities in the country.\n\nSpeaking with TechCabal, EatUp co-founder and CEO, Abiodun Biobaku, said EatUp was founded out of a desire to provide the city\u2019s rising middle class with easy access to quality food and help restaurants bypass physical constraints that limit the number of eat-in consumers they can accommodate.\n\nEatUp partners with restaurants to allow it to deliver food to its consumers from their favourite restaurants in the shortest possible time, and in a nice package. \u201cWe claim to deliver happiness in new boxes, and that is what we\u2019ve been doing so far,\u201d Biobaku said.\n\nBut this has been increasingly difficult to achieve, Biobaku told TechCabal, as the inflation has forced the startup to increase its daily operation costs without a corresponding growth in profits. \u201cWe have watched inflation grow all the way from 14% to its current position right now, and trust me, it has taken a toll on our daily operation costs. We run daily operation costs, and in the last 30 months we have seen it grow by an average of 20%,\u201d the CEO told TechCabal.\n\nRising costs eating up earnings\n\nBiobaku said that, as an online food delivery business it always needs to be online to receive delivery from its website and different social media channels and websites, and even that doesn\u2019t come easy anymore as its internet provider partners have also increased their prices to weather the ravaging inflation.\n\nBiobaku explained that the rising inflation is hurting EatUp\u2019s earnings, mostly because partner restaurants are shortening their food rations in order to mark up their own profit margin, forcing customers to find cheaper alternatives. \u201cWe used to have customers or regular users who at least 3 times per day would have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but we have now witnessed a reduction in the frequency of ordering,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also costs EatUp more to buy bikes for its riders, pay for data, packaging, and branding and get fuel for its riders\u2014all essential elements of its food delivery operations.\n\nWhile dealing with this, it also witnessed a drop in the number of orders each of its customers makes. \u201cWe currently boast of an 80% return rate for our over 16,000 customers, but the frequency at which they buy is reduced. At every point where there\u2019s an increase in inflation rates, the buying power of every user declines.\u201d\n\nWhile EatUp is searching for funding, it is wary of the value of the amount it is seeking as the prices of equipment and its burn rate are constantly increasing, so they will have to get \u201ccreative\u201d about cutting operating costs, Biobaku said.\n\nEatUp\u2019s daily office operation costs have shot up. It spends more on fuel to provide constant power for its customer experience team who needs to stay online to receive orders and monitor delivery to customers.\n\nEarlier in March, Nigeria\u2019s power grid collapsed twice, depriving thousands of businesses of power supply. At the same time, businesses had to scramble to get petrol due to fuel scarcity, and when they did it was at a higher price.\n\nEatUp is one of the thousands of businesses in the country whose operation costs shot up in the past few months due to fuel hikes and lousy power supply.\n\nWorking-class Nigerians in various cities were left to scramble for petrol for their cars before they could get to work. For those that do not have cars and rely on public transport, a 100% increase in transportation costs means they have to fork out more money from their salaries to transport themselves to work. EatUp\u2019s employees were not spared and Biobaku said that many started coming late to the office while spending more money to transport themselves to the office. This, coupled with the increasing cost of goods and services at the time, made their take-home much lower and Biobaku noted that this dwindling welfare affected the startup\u2019s productivity. At the same time, the startup\u2019s delivery riders groaned at the increasing amount of money they were spending on fuel.\n\nIn a bid to survive the ravaging inflation and increasing fuel prices that month, the food delivery startup had to mark up its delivery fee by 20%, from \u20a6500 to \u20a6600. The startup also established partnerships with fuel suppliers to purchase fuel at a discounted rate and distribute it to its fleet of 15 bikes. But that was only a palliative.\n\n\u201cIn March, we shot way above our expenses budget for the month and that has never happened to us throughout the 30 months of running this business,\u201d Biobaku lamented.\n\n\u201cOur solution to create accessible food for our consumers is being threatened,\u201d Biobaku said.\n\nAfter speaking with its bike riders who were clamouring for the startup to take action in the light of the latest fuel hike, and increase in the cost of spare parts, the startup decided to markup its delivery fee again, this time by 8.33% to \u20a6650. \u201cThis is the reality of every Nigerian business. You cannot have a steady price rate for so long,\u201d Biobaku said.\n\nTo bolster its chances of surviving, the startup has turned to rigorously cutting costs and developing additional money-making avenues. It cut costs by buying spare parts directly from manufacturers to bypass cost-adding middlemen and running strict office hours that see it open its office only when it is in use and putting out the lights immediately it is not. Its new money-making venture involves creating paid advertisements for partner restaurants and initiating the collection of service charges from them.\n\nBut Biobaku doesn\u2019t believe his startup is out of the woods yet; he believes he needs to be prepared for the economic hardship still ravaging the country. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re having right now is that we\u2019ll be churning out new products in the nearest future. We need to make allowance for imbalances in the economy because these unforeseen circumstances are threatening to kill products even before we introduce them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Every July 16, World PR day is celebrated all over the globe. Actually, this annual commemoration has not always existed; the maiden edition was held in 2021. As with most globally recognised days, the goal is to make people understand the public relation (PR) profession and know how well to leverage it. Not surprisingly, practitioners in the field believe that PR roles are largely misunderstood and probably underappreciated.\n\nTalking about being misunderstood, I\u2019ll make a quick reference to one I can well relate to \u2014 the relations between PR experts and journalists. You see. this unavoidable connection is quite complicated, even though these roles are highly interdependent. Several studies conducted worldwide have confirmed this. A 2016 Forbes article authored by Conrad Egusa puts it thus, \u201cthe relationship between PR professionals and journalists is known for being adversarial. Journalists view PR reps as obstacles who either get in the way of stories or try to create stories from nothing. On the other hand, PR reps get frustrated when journalists ignore their work.\u201d\n\nAs a journalist, I agree totally but also believe the PR industry needs the media to thrive. Olugbeminiyi Idowu, aka Bemi, somewhat agrees with the author\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\u201cPR is one of the underrated careers out here at the moment. I don\u2019t think people understand how impactful and powerful PR is. PR is the machine that forms how people think; it influences buying decisions, it influences where people live, work, and how people engage with each other. PR involves every aspect of life. But the best thing about it is nine times out of ten, PR goes unseen. And I think that\u2019s also a wonderful thing because we can be invisible in the background and let our work do the talking for us,\u201d he shares.\n\nOlugbeminiyi is a London-based African tech PR expert and is currently the brain behind Talking Drum Communications, a PR consultancy startup focused on African tech businesses.\n\nBemi, the Nigerian son on English soil\n\nOlugbeminiyi \u2018Bemi\u2019 Idowu. Tech PR expert. Founder, Talking Drum Communications. Source: Supplied\n\nBemi, a name you\u2019d repeatedly see in the rest of this piece, has an interesting backstory. In a nutshell, it was a coping strategy.\n\nAfter his secondary school study in Nigeria and two failed attempts at obtaining an undergraduate admission, Ibadan-born Bemi was relocated by his parents to the UK to get a university education.\n\nWhile adjusting to the new environment, the English people he interacted with found it difficult to pronounce his first name. Admittedly, the name is quite a mouthful, but he couldn\u2019t stomach how it was constantly mispronounced; this led him to find a truce with Bemi.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was like a good middle ground between what my name is and what the people around me could say. So, that then became my name for a very long time.\u201d\n\nFor many years, he embraced this identity until later in his professional life when he had to go back to identifying with his full name after he started working with Nigerian businesses that shouldn\u2019t ordinarily have a problem with it.\n\nIn the early stages, that wasn\u2019t the only thing Bemi had to deal with, and there was only so much adapting and coping he could do.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the UK, one of the things that used to annoy me in the early days was that a lot of people around me knew nothing about Nigeria or Africa. The Only thing they knew about Africa was that there were poor people there. That was the only conversation people wanted to have with me, and that used to annoy me.\u201d\n\nThis got to him for different reasons, but it was only a matter of time before he took a stand.\n\n\u201cI went through a phase where I was trying to be like everybody else to make peace with who I am; I was then able to have a little more grounding in myself and engage with the world in a more authentic way.\u201d\n\nBut how did Bemi find himself in PR?\n\nOlugbeminiyi \u2018Bemi\u2019 Idowu. Tech PR expert. Founder, Talking Drum Communications. Source: Supplied\n\nLoving one\u2019s personal space has always been Bemi\u2019s unique trait while growing up. Feeling he was enough company for himself, he played games that should have taken two or more children alone.\n\n\u201cI was very comfortable in my own space. And I think this helped my storytelling skill and being able to just be my own person in my own space. Those things have helped me as I\u2019ve gone through life because sometimes you go through periods where you have to be your own person and make your own decisions. That was the beginning of that part of me, and then, me just creating a narrative around nothing. When I then got to the university, when it came to writing, my imagination was quite active. I could see things; I could see patterns.\u201d\n\nSo, intrigued by his journalist father\u2019s lifestyle and his attraction toward books as a child, Bemi made a mental note that he\u2019d become a journalist in the future.\n\n\u201cMy original plan was to be a journalist. In another life, I\u2019ll probably be doing what you are doing. Because I like writing, I do it to relax; I find it enjoyable.\u201d\n\nHeaded in that direction, he studied journalism and creative writing at Kingston University, London, and hoped this would boost his other dream of becoming a TV host.\n\nLike many people in his graduating set, Bemi didn\u2019t anticipate what came after he graduated.\n\n\u201cWhen I graduated in 2008, I graduated around the same time there was a big global financial crisis which meant there was no job anywhere. Even people that were offered jobs, their jobs were rescinded.\u201d\n\nBadly hit by this, Bemi happened on what has become his gold mine.\n\n\u201cI randomly stumbled on an internship at a PR agency somewhere in London. They were looking for an intern to help with admin.\u201d\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the silver lining he\u2019d expected because it was an unpaid internship. However, he augmented it with an evening shift job that earned him stipends. While the company didn\u2019t turn out to be the ideal place he envisaged, Bemi admits that it wasn\u2019t bad for a first exposure to PR, so he decided to explore it further.\n\nHe had another stop as an intern in another company before he got his first full-time job at a charity organisation. A few months later, he got another opportunity. By 2011, he entered the tech PR scene, which has been an upward climb.\n\n\u201cIn terms of my next career move, what was I supposed to do? Should I continue that European PR path? Or should I explore what\u2019s happening on the other side?\u201d\n\nBy the way, Bemi has worked in six firms doing PR in the last 13 years.\n\nGetting into the African tech PR space\n\nAfter eight years in the European PR space, he got into Wimbart, an Africa-focused tech PR agency. And then, nearly two years later, in the middle of a pandemic, Bemi made a change in his career.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that became very clear to me is that in life, sometimes you have to take risks. If you don\u2019t take risks, you\u2019d never know. You don\u2019t win the lottery if you don\u2019t buy the ticket. And there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019d win.\u201d\n\nAfter thorough planning and mentorship, Talking Drum Communications \u2014 inspired by the communication features and the intricate design of the famous West African percussion instrument, gangan \u2014 started taking shape in 2020 before an official launch in 2021.\n\nOlugbeminiyi \u2018Bemi\u2019 Idowu on his first day as the founder of Talking Drum Communications. Source: supplied\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all rosy, but Bemi constantly reminds himself that impossible is not a fact; it\u2019s an opinion.\n\nWithin the first month, the startup got its first client, and for Bemi, this was a major turning point and confirmation that he was doing something right.\n\nPutting creative skills to good use\n\nBemi believes all the skills he used his childhood to develop and his period in school to polish eventually came to be very handy in the tech space. He mentions how his roles require him to make people understand and get excited by something that would ordinarily be considered boring.\n\n\u201cGoing to the university and studying creative writing, which is basically a degree that involves reading and analysing novels; analysing plotlines, narrative structures and all those sorts of things. For me, having that background meant that bringing it to tech PR, I can use those skills to tell stories about very boring things.\u201d\n\nOlugbeminiyi \u2018Bemi\u2019 Idowu. Tech PR expert. Founder, Talking Drum Communications. Supplied\n\nHe also considers having highly educated and supportive parents one of his privileges. But the knowledge he had gained from studying journalism and putting it to use in an online men\u2019s fashion magazine, Sharp Guy, that he ran for four years is a high point.\n\n\u201cIt was weird for me because I was still working in PR at that time, but I used to get press releases from other PRs from across the world who wanted me to feature their product or their company on the platform. That experience gave me an opportunity to know how the other end of this news creation cycle works.\u201d\n\nIf anything, experiences like this one contributed to his confidence to start his PR firm despite the uncertainties. Talking about his favourite part of being a tech PR specialist, Bemi mentions how he\u2019s always excited about interacting with founders.\n\nAnother high point is having one of his first tech clients in Europe get acquired by a bigger company. For him, that gave him the certainty that if stories are told the right way, it could help startups achieve their long-term growth.\n\nConsidering a career in PR?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not organised, PR is going to be very difficult for you. Whether you work in-house as a company or you work for an agency, you\u2019re constantly juggling multiple tasks. If you\u2019re unable to organise your day and stay on top of your deadlines, you\u2019re going to struggle with it.\u201d\n\nHis recommendation is to develop excellent creative writing skills. Bemi refers to the ability to create consistent stories from limited information. Data conceptualisation is also an important technical skill depending on the industry you play in. He adds the importance of constant commitment to personal development.\n\nBemi has an intense commitment to learning, borne out of a fear of becoming irrelevant. Hence, he constantly finds opportunities to acquire knowledge and be on top of his game.\n\nBemi believes PR roles are demanding, although rewarding. Although at the early stage, it might not be considered lucrative.\n\nAccording to Bemi, a tech PR professional\u2019s roles involve helping startups create a public perception that would help them secure what they want to achieve as a business. And this can come with a lot of pressure, which, if not properly managed, can hinder a person\u2019s chance at having a life outside work.\n\nAn average day has him building a good business score for his clients, which varies depending on the present need, making sure deadlines are met. It might mean sending out press releases, reports, campaigns, pitching to the media, applying for awards, or hypothetically quenching a fire.\n\nBemi unwinds by reading, watching football, and scrolling endlessly through YouTube watching sports commentaries and highlights, including reaction videos.\n\nBemi is big on calendar scheduling; he also uses Cello, a task management software, at work, Google spreadsheet for progress tracking, WhatsApp, Google alerts to keep track of media coverage, Slack, and Zoom.\n\nBemi advises that as an intending PR professional, \u201cGet ready for a lot of Nos.\u201d But make sure things get better with every try. On his bucket list is travelling across every African country.",

          "text": "Amid the decline in the revenues disbursed to them by the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) in recent months, the total debt owed by states to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has increased to N1.24 trillion.\n\nIn November last year, President Muhammadu Buhari approved a N656 billion bridge financing facility to the 36 states to help them meet financial obligations, especially the previous budget support facility due for repayment.\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, said the loans would be given to states \u201cover a period of six months towards cushioning the effects of their resumption in the repayment of the three federal government bailout facilities (salary bailout, excess crude facility and budget support facility)\u201d.\n\nData obtained from the CBN showed that the states started borrowing from the apex bank in April 2016, with the total loan put at N14.58 billion at the time.\n\nThe debt owed to the central bank jumped to N300.38 billion in December 2016 and N590.42 billion at the end of 2017.\n\nFollowing the collapse in global oil prices, the country slipped into recession in the second quarter of 2016 and emerged from it a year after.\n\nStates\u2019 debt to the central bank declined gradually to N600.62 billion in October 2021 from N614.92 trillion in September 2019, but jumped to N700.47 billion in December last year. It rose further to N1.24 trillion in June this year, according to the latest data from the CBN.\n\nThe revenues shared by the federal, state and local governments in the first quarter of this year fell to N2.18 trillion from N2.46 trillion in the previous quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThe disbursement by FAAC to states declined to N590.45 billion in the first quarter of this year from N640.16 billion in the previous quarter.\n\n\u201cA decline in the FAAC allocation would exacerbate the state governments\u2019 financial difficulties, resulting in salary cuts and staff layoffs, which will likely affect aggregate demand and consumption levels as income levels remain squeezed,\u201d analysts at Financial Derivatives Company Limited, led by economic expert Bismarck Rewane, said.\n\nThe decline in FAAC allocation comes as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company failed to make any remittances to FAAC this year, with monthly deductions from net oil and gas revenues to fund petrol subsidy.\n\nPetrol subsidy, which the national oil company preferred to call \u201cvalue shortfall\u201d or \u201cunder-recovery\u201d, gobbled up N1.27 trillion in the first five months of this year, according to data from the NNPC.\n\nThe finance minister said last week that the transition of the NNPC to a commercial entity had raised the expectation that the huge subsidy bill could be offset through royalties and taxes from the company as it would no longer make remittances to FAAC.\n\n\u201cNNPC will be paying royalties, dividends and taxes; so while the revenue might not be monthly, we will work out an arrangement with them on how this will be paid. It is possible to work out an arrangement where the payment could be made to the federation either monthly or quarterly,\u201d she added.\n\nAkpan Ekpo, a professor of Economics and Public Policy and former member of the CBN Monetary Policy Committee, said the states\u2019 borrowing from the apex bank showed they are financially distressed.\n\n\u201cOnly Rivers, Lagos and Kano are economically viable while the others are largely dependent on the federal allocation,\u201d he said. \u201cThese states have to look for ways to generate more internally generated revenue to reduce their reliance on FAAC and borrowings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle for the government to lend money to states to pay their previous loans. This is a cycle that does not make sense,\u201d Ekpo added.\n\nRead also: Inflation: Doubts raised over effectiveness of CBN\u2019s rate hikes\n\nThe World Bank had warned last month that a fiscal time bomb could explode in Nigeria owing to the soaring petrol subsidy and plunging crude oil production in the country.\n\n\u201cThe worsening revenue collection at the federation level is increasing budgetary pressures for the states, and many states are in a precarious fiscal position. With net oil and gas revenues stagnating, most states will not be able to achieve their intended levels of expenditures in 2022,\u201d it said.\n\nLast week, the Federal Government revealed that its revenue exceeded debt service costs in the first four months of this year. Its retained revenue was N1.63 trillion, less than half of the N3.32 trillion budgeted for the period, but it spent N1.94 trillion on servicing debts.\n\nNigeria\u2019s public debt stock rose by N2.04 trillion in the first quarter of this year to N41.60 trillion, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nThe Federal Government borrowed N2.45 trillion from the CBN in the first four months of this year, bringing its total debt to the CBN to N19.91 trillion, data from the apex bank show.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers\u2019 options to plug a higher budget deficit will be few and far between, with some potentially damaging economic consequences. External borrowing costs have surged; sovereign dollar bond yields now stand at 13.2 percent, a level at which emerging markets have historically refrained from international debt issuance,\u201d London-based Capital Economics said in a report on why Nigeria is struggling while oil prices are so high.\n\nIt noted that such unfavourable market conditions pushed the Nigerian authorities to drop plans to raise $950 million by issuing Eurobonds in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cAnd domestic borrowing costs are just as high, with the yield on 10-year government bonds reaching 11.2 percent. At the very least, increased government borrowing is likely to crowd out lending to the private sector. And, perhaps most worryingly, the authorities may be tempted to rely more on central bank financing,\u201d it said.",

We only monitor. It is the APC that said they could not do the primary, so we said okay,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy the time we woke up in the morning, they said at some location, they have done governorship primary. We are not aware of it; we didn\u2019t monitor it.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Akwa Ibom REC\u2019s report has been followed by criticism, with APC members in the state insisting that the governorship primary held.\n\nEseme Eyiboh, a house of representatives candidate in the state, had spoken recently on the circumstances around the governorship primary, adding that the party should mot be punished for INEC\u2019s absence.",

          "text": "British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak, would clash on TV for a second time in 24 hours.\n\nThey sought to win the leadership of the Conservative Party, thus, taking the job of prime minister.\n\nThe two hopefuls to head the Tory party clashed already on Monday, primarily about their economic plans.\n\nThe two would now face each other again in a TalkTV/Sun event at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT), with both sides hoping to learn tactical lessons from the BBC clash the night before.\n\nThat showdown saw the two rivals trash each other\u2019s economic plans, while personal attacks continued, with Sunak accused by allies of Truss of \u201cmansplaining\u2019\u2019 during the debate.\n\nSunak claimed there is \u201cnothing conservative\u2019\u2019 about Truss\u2019 approach to cutting taxes and pumping up borrowing, arguing it would give the party absolutely no chance of winning the next election.\n\nTruss, in turn, suggested her rival would lead the country into a recession and criticised him for increasing taxes to the \u201chighest rate in 70 years.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn China, Truss accused her rival of pushing for closer trade relationships while Sunak said Liz has been on a journey to get to a point where she opposes closer ties.\n\nSunak also sought to stress his decision to quit acting Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government as a sign he acts according to his principles, while Truss stressed her loyalty to her current boss.\n\nJohnson opted to give up the job early this month after dozens of officials quit his government to protest a string of scandals.\n\nBut both candidates ruled out a job for Johnson in their Cabinet, with Truss saying she believed he needed a well-earned break before eventually adding.\n\n\u201cI am sure he will have a role; I am sure he will be vocal but he will not be part of the government.\u2019\u2019\n\nSunak was more direct in his reply by saying: \u201cThe simple answer for me is no.\u2019\u2019\n\nA snap poll by Opinium, based on a sample of 1,032 voters, found that 39 per cent believed Sunak had performed best compared to 38 per cent for Truss.\n\nBut crucially Tory voters split 47 per cent to 38 per cent in favour of the foreign secretary.\n\nWith postal ballots set to arrive on Tory members\u2019 doorsteps by Aug. 5, Sunak needed good performances in the debates and the early hustings.\n\nOpinion polls and member surveys had suggested that he trailed Truss in the battle to win the votes of card-carrying Conservatives, with the foreign secretary the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to be elected as Tory leader on Sept. 5.\n\nFormer cabinet minister, David Davis, who supported Sunak, said Truss\u2019 policies would risk fuelling inflation.\n\nThis is leading to the Bank of England being forced to increase interest rates as high as 7 per cent hitting people with mortgages and other debts.\n\n\u201cThe Tory Party, generally speaking, is a bit older than average. It\u2019s a little bit more middle class, but not so much these days, but a little bit more middle class,\u2019\u2019 he told Sky News.\n\n\u201cIt will care about things like their offspring having to face these sorts of interest rates in the future so that matters.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe rejected suggestions from allies of Truss, including Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey, that Sunak had been mansplaining and talking over his rival.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s important to intervene in debates,\u2019\u2019 Davis said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe need the person who (a knows what he stands for, b) is courageous enough to take the difficult decisions and c) determined enough to do it.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s Rishi Sunak.\u2019\u2019\n\nCabinet minister Simon Clarke, a Truss ally, said: \u201cI think there were some pretty aggressive moments at the outset from Rishi towards Liz in terms of interrupting her as she tried to set out her case but, by and large.\n\n\u201cI think the debate was held in a reasonable spirit reflecting, obviously, the importance of the issues.\u2019\u2019\n\nClarke, who was Sunak\u2019s ministerial deputy in the Treasury before the former chancellor resigned, defended Truss\u2019 economic plans.\n\nHe told Sky that putting the COVID-related debt in a separate category would give the ability to pay it back over a longer period, allowing more flexibility with day-to-day spending.\n\nBut he added: \u201cThere will be decisions to be taken on wider levels of government spending across the board to make sure this is a costed plan.\n\n\u201cAs conservatives, we have to believe I do, very firmly, believe that growing the economy through pro-growth measures including tax cuts is the right thing to do.\u2019\u2019",

This was shared during the 2-day hybrid event held on July 13-14, 2022, at the prestigious Transcorp Hilton Hotel Abuja which had about 4,000 registered delegates from 55 countries.\n\nGiving a keynote address at the event on the theme, \u2018Rethink, Rebuild, Recover, Accelerating Growth for the SDGs\u2019, Mr. Schmale noted that the theme was apt, timely, relevant, and required given the economic regression across Africa occasioned by the pandemic, the volatilities caused by the Ukraine war and the fact there was just 8 years to go before 2030. He commended the leadership of the Sterling One Foundation stressing that there was need for intensive collaborations and partnerships among African leaders across the public and private sectors including the civil society groups to aid the achievement of not just the 2030 goals but also, the African Union\u2019s 2063 goals.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Mrs. Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO, Sterling One Foundation, noted that the summit had in-depth and insightful panel sessions on climate action, education access and funding, primary healthcare, youth and gender empowerment, impact investment and governance which all give a good appreciation of the 17 interlinked global goals.\n\nShe added that a recurring resolution that came through in all the panel sessions was the need for elimination of silo executions and embracing of collaborations by all sector players. Financing strategies, impact measurement and evaluation of such impact was also discussed as\n\nit was clear that the SDGs require financing to become a reality with an estimated amount of $1.3 trillion annually in Africa as shared by the UN and over $300 billion to block the gap in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cVarious deals from 4 African countries were brought to the summit\u2019s Deal Room with innovative solutions that cut across the education, health, construction, renewable energy, and food security sectors. Most of these businesses already have conditional commitments from our investors at the event and we expect to seal these deals in the coming weeks working with the investees. We will continue facilitating financing for purpose and profit driven business solutions that will help promote access to health and education for all while guaranteeing returns for impact investors locally and globally\u2019\u2019, she added.\n\nShe noted that the Foundation was already working with various partners and will continue in this light as the event was organized in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact Network Nigeria, Sterling Bank, the Coca Cola Company, VFD Group, the Impact Investors Foundation, Giving.ng, the Nigeria Climate Innovation Center (NCIC), the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Ventures Africa, Proshare and Tech Cabal.",

          "text": "The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global health emergency at the weekend, as calls grow for swift action to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nMore than 16,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in 75 countries so far this year, the WHO said on Monday.\n\nHere is an overview of the symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and vaccines.\n\n\u2013 Symptoms \u2013\n\nThe first symptoms can include a fever, headaches, sharp muscle pains, fatigue, a rash, as well as swollen and painful lymph nodes.\n\nAround one to three days after the appearance of a fever, a rash can turn into painful, fluid-filled skin lesions.\n\nAfter a few days or weeks, the lesions or sores turn into scabs, before falling off.\n\nMonkeypox has long been endemic in Central and Western Africa. In countries elsewhere that have recorded cases since May, the lesions have been more common around the genitals and anus, as well as on the mouth.\n\nOn Monday, the UK Health Security Agency expanded its list of symptoms to include just one or two genital or anal lesions, as well as rectal pain or bleeding.\n\nSymptoms have varied between patients, however. They usually last between two to four weeks, and the virus is contagious until the rash has fully healed.\n\n\u2013 Diagnosis \u2013\n\nMost of the recent global cases have been in men who have sex with men and have recently had sex with a new partner, according to the WHO.\n\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week found that 98 percent of infected people were gay or bisexual men, and 95 percent of cases were transmitted through sexual activity.\n\nDiagnosing the virus can be difficult due to its inconsistent symptoms, which can resemble sexually transmitted infections, several health authorities have warned.\n\nEurope has been the epicentre of the outbreak, with many cases among younger men living in cities, according to the WHO.\n\nConfirming a case of monkeypox may require a PCR test, or a sample or biopsy of a skin lesion.\n\nThose with potential cases must isolate while waiting for test results. Once the virus is confirmed, isolation is recommended for three weeks.\n\nMonkeypox has been detected in semen, but is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, instead spreading through close physical contact. The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) recommends using a condom for 12 weeks after recovery.\n\n\u2013 Treatment \u2013\n\nThe disease usually heals by itself after two to three weeks, sometimes taking a month.\n\nIn many cases, the only treatment needed is to address the symptoms, such as clearing up a fever or soothing the itching.\n\nSometimes the lesions can become extremely painful, however, requiring serious painkillers or even hospital treatment.\n\nThe most severe cases have been seen in children, pregnant women and people with comprised immune systems.\n\nNo deaths have been reported so far in Europe or the United States.\n\nPeople with monkeypox are advised not to scratch the lesions, as this could spread the virus or leave a scar, and to cover them to avoid the temptation.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has approved a smallpox medication, Tecovirimat, for monkeypox treatment.\n\n\u2013 Vaccines \u2013\n\nA smallpox vaccine from Danish drug maker Bavarian Nordic, marketed under the name Jynneos in the United States and Imvanex in Europe, has also been found to protect against monkeypox.\n\nThe European Commission approved its use for monkeypox on Monday.\n\nIt can also have a \u201csignificant protective effect\u201d if administered within four days of exposure to a monkeypox case, according to the ECDC.\n\nCountries such as Britain, Canada, France and the United States have started offering vaccination to those most at risk of the virus.\n\nThe vaccine is given in two doses, at least 28 days apart. But for people vaccinated against smallpox as children, one dose is enough. For people with comprised immune systems, a third dose is recommended.\n\nAs the vaccines do not provide immediate or total protection, health authorities advise caution after receiving an injection.\n\nThe United States also has many doses of the older generation ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine, but it is not recommended for everyone because of significant side effects.",

Policies are being made by politicians that govern tI am practicing both even as national women leader of APC.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe national women leader of the All Progressives Congress, Betta Edu has commended the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his untiring role in promoting the course of women in the country.\n\nSpeaking on the antecedents of the APC presidential candidate in empowering women, Dr Edu said the APC candidate remains one person who has remained committed to pushing the course of women not just in Lagos but across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe recalls how the former governor of Lagos started the trend of having a female as deputy governor.\n\nThe women leader said the APC candidate has given many women the platform to thrive not only in political space, but every other sphere of life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe APC national women leader said the former governor is someone that can be trusted that he will give women more opportunities when he gets to power.\n\n\u201cIf you follow his records very closely, you will know that his excellency, Bola Ahmed Tinubu is one person who began that strong push for women, not just in Lagos state, but in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe started what is now the trend of having a female as deputy governor. He has given women more opportunities in government. A former deputy governor of Lagos State, Her Excellency, Adegbule, who is my very good friend, is now given half of the State to represent because she is a senatorial candidate of the party in area where you have Alimosho which is the half of the state if not more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I had one-on-one with Asiwaju Tinubu, he made it categorically clear that we cannot grow the country without women, without the women we cannot succeed.

In that period, around 150,000 First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit children were taken from their homes and placed in those schools.In a landmark 2015 report by Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, survivors spoke publicly about being subject to abuse, illness and malnutrition at residential schools.\n\nMore than 3,000 students are thought to have died at the schools.

          "text": "The United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Access Bank have signed a commitment letter for $280 million to help address the financing gap for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThe US Embassy in a statement issued Monday said the commitment letter was signed by DFC CEO, Scott Nathan and Access Bank Managing Director, Roosevelt Ogbonna in Lagos Monday.\n\nNathan said the DFC financing for Access Bank would provide needed liquidity given the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe added that the intervention was expected to support at least 4,000 new SME loans in Nigeria.\n\nNathan noted that the loan proceeds would be on-lent across more than a dozen sectors in the Nigerian economy, with specific focus on women-owned SMEs, and on loans with longer tenors, which will provide more flexibility to borrowers.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe loan will help address the financing gap for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and advance financial inclusion in Nigeria, including through the bank\u2019s commitment to supporting women-owned and -led businesses.\n\n\u201cDFC\u2019s investment in Access Bank demonstrates US support for private sector-led development in Nigeria and throughout West Africa.\n\n\u201cThe $280 million loan from DFC will boost financial inclusion in Nigeria and empower women, bolstering the country\u2019s economic growth.\u201d\n\nAlso, the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard said she looked forward to discussing with the public and private sectors how DFC funding could be leveraged to unleash the full economic potential of Nigeria through support to the country\u2019s small and medium-sized businesses, financial sector, and climate change-focused enterprises.\n\nOn his part, Ogbonna said Access Bank was extremely pleased to announce the strategic partnership with DFC to support the multitude of businesses across Nigeria who stand to benefit from greater access to finance, especially in an environment that was in need of stronger economic diversification.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe look forward to utilising the partnership with DFC in driving further economic expansion and inclusion in Nigeria, with a strong focus on non-oil sectors and women businesses.\u201d\n\nAlso, Citi Bank Head of Emerging Markets Corporate Bank, Rizwan Shaikh his bank was delighted to have collaborated with Access Bank and DFC on the significant transaction, which would significantly boost SME corporate activity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another milestone stride for Citi as it executes a focused local-economy development strategy based on solid partnerships with key clients and development agencies,\u201d he added.\n\nAccess Bank Bags Compliance Management System Standard Certification\n\nMeanwhile, in recognition of its commitment to achieving sustainable business continuity, Access Bank has been conferred the MSECB Management System Certificate in accordance with the management system requirements in ISO 37301:2021.\n\nThis feat sees the institution become the first bank to achieve certification against this standard, according to a statement.\n\nThe certification which was issued upon review of the bank\u2019s compliance management system contributes to SDGs 8, 16 and 11, affirming its commitment to promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, as well as making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\n\nCommenting on the feat, Ogbonna, said, \u201cThis certification demonstrates that the bank\u2019s board of directors and management are committed to meeting internationally accepted standards in our global banking operations, particularly in the areas of sustainability and compliance.\n\n\u201cWe believe that attaining this global standard would serve to deepen the trust that our stakeholders have in our institution as we continue to innovatively bridge worlds and connect customers to opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe certification, which is valid for a period of three years, is subject to satisfactory surveillance audits and would also be used as a management measuring tool. The tool would be used to evaluate Access Bank\u2019s business continuity policies and operations, sustainability practices and management compliance systems.\n\nPublished in April 2021, the ISO 37301 Compliance Management System seeks to provide a certifiable global benchmark for compliance systems.\n\n\u201cAs a leading financial institution, Access Bank continues to promote responsible environmental stewardship and stimulate socially responsible development.\n\n\u201cIts management approach to sustainability is grounded on global best practices and aims to impact across the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s hope of reversing its current dip in oil production which stands at a little above one million barrels per day (bpd) on Mknday received a boost as TotalEnergies announced that production has started at its 50,000bpd Ikike oil field.\n\nIkike oilfield is located on Oil Mining Lease (OML) 59, 20 kilometers off the coast, at a depth of about 20 meters. The platform is tied back to the existing Amenam offshore facilities through a 14km multipurpose pipeline.\n\nThe French oil major and operator of OML 59 with 40 per cent interest in partnership with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited which holds 60 per cent interest, announced the start of production at Ikike field in a statement issued Monday in Paris, France.\n\nAt peak production, the company said the facility would deliver 50,000bpd of oil equivalent by the end of 2022.\n\nTotalEnergies said the Ikike project leveraged existing facilities to keep costs low, and was designed to minimise greenhouse emissions, estimated at less than 4kg COze/boe.\n\nThe international oil company (IOC) added that the facilities would contribute to reducing the average carbon intensity of TotalEnergies\u2019 upstream portfolio.\n\nIn addition, the statement noted that 95 per cent of hours was worked locally, while the jackets as well as the topside modules were entirely built and integrated by local contractors.\n\n\u201cTotalEnergies is pleased to start production at Ikike, which was launched a few months before the Covid pandemic, and whose success owes a lot to the full mobilisation of the teams. By tapping discoveries close to existing facilities, this project fits the company\u2019s strategy of focusing on low-cost and low-emission oil projects,\u201d Senior Vice President, Africa, Exploration and Production, TotalEnergies, Henri-Max Ndong-Nzue was quoted to have said in the statement.\n\nNigeria has continued to witness unabating production deficit for years despite the increase in the country\u2019s monthly production quota by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe situation has been blamed on a number of factors including the massive oil theft and vandalisation of oil assets, ageing infrastructure, non-restart of oil platforms shut down during COVID, as well as the withdrawal of capital investments for exploration and production by the oil majors, who are now focused on their divestments.\n\nPeter Uzoho",
