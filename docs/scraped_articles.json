          "text": "More condemnations on Tuesday trailed the move by the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele, to contest in the 2023 presidential election on the All Progressives Congress while presiding over the apex bank.\n\nA legal practitioner, Dr. Remi Olatubora (SAN), on Tuesday threatened to galvanise Nigerians and the civil society to institute not less than 1,000 cases against Emefiele, should he go ahead with his 2023 presidential ambition on the platform of the APC.\n\nAccording to him, he would ensure that in the next 10 years, the CBN governor would be jumping from one court to the other and inundate him with litigation, \u201cthe kind that has never happened in the history of legal profession in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had in his clarification said he had not taken the decision to run for the Presidency in 2023.\n\nOn Monday, his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, filed a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/610/2022 challenging the legality of Section 84(12) of the amended Electoral Act and to prevent its application to him (a government appointee) in his aspiration to vie for the APC Presidential ticket.\n\nBut Olatubora, a former Commissioner for Education in Ondo State during the administration of Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, in an interview with The PUNCH said Emefiele\u2019s lawyers should be prepared for a lot of job.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf Emefiele, the governor of CBN who is entrusted with the public finance of Nigeria, who is the custodian of our foreign exchange, who is the chairman of the Bankers Committee could brazenly come out to tell members of the public that he is a member of APC and goes ahead to collect N100 million expression of interest form; if he submits that form, we will ensure that in the next 10 years, he will be jumping from one court to the other.\n\n\u201cWe will inundate him with litigation, the kind that has never happened in the history of legal profession in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe should expect up to 1,000 cases and his lawyers should be prepared for a lot of job. He should expect up to 1,000 cases in different courts by different interests that his coming into politics will infract on their rights and it will be coordinated and we will ensure that in the next 10 years, he will be jumping from one court to the other.\n\nA former Deputy Governor of the CBN, Prof Kingsley Mogahalu, also took a dim view of Emefiele\u2019s action, describing it as a breach of the CBN Act.\n\nHe accused Emefiele of using public office to attain his personal interest, urging Nigerians not to reward such an act.\n\nMogahalu, who is an aspirant under the African Democratic Congress, spoke while picking up the expression of interest form at the party\u2019s secretariat in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cI weep for this nation with the development at the CBN. It is deeply wrong to play politics while in office. It is a violation of ethics, moral and the law. What we are seeing is the privatisation of public office for personal gains.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act is clear; Section (9) states that the CBN governor and his deputy should not engage in other employment of vocation. A vocation is something that could take up your time; it may not be a job, it may not be something you could put your hands on, but something that your have your mind and heart in, apart from your duties.\n\n\u201cFor the CBN Governor, his heart and mind is in politics up to the extent of going to a law court to seek support for his ambition. First of all, I want to say Nigerians have no business in rewarding this massive breach of the rule of law because the action of the CBN governor shows a contempt of the rule of law. The individual in question has been monumentally incompetent and Nigerians should not support incompetence.\u201d\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project said it was considering legal options to compel the Independent National Electoral Commission to move election from the custody of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe group said its action was predicted on the involvement of Emefiele in partisan politics.\n\nAlso, the Conference of Nigeria Political Parties has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to sack Emefiele over his involvement in politics.\n\nSpeaking during a press briefing held alongside the Coalition of National Civil Society Organizations, the Secretary General of the group, Chief Willy Ezugwu and the National Secretary for the CSOs, Ali Abacha, insisted that Emefiele\u2019s involvement in politics was in clear violation of the Public Service rules and the CBN Act.\n\nThe group threatened that it would persuade serving judicial officers to pick up nomination forms from political parties of their choice, should Buhari fail to sack Emefiele.\n\nIt stated, \u201cTheir intention was to cause a breach of peace as a licence for security agencies to give the protesters the #EndSARS treatment. In this light, the hired hoodlums were to sneak into the crowd of protesters and attack the CBN headquarters with weapons while a counter-protest was also arranged for the same day.\n\n\u201cOur findings revealed that Mr Godwin Emefiele joined the APC and became a card-carrying member of the party in 2019, which proved that the CBN governor\u2019s presidential ambition was premeditated and has been in his plans before 2019 when he eventually joined partisan politics. This is contrary to Mr. Godwin Emefiele\u2019s position that his focus was on his job at the CBN.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in an interview with one of our correspondents on Tuesday, SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, said the continued stay of the materials with the CBN was risky, adding that they must be prevented from unlawful interference.\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, we are considering our legal options to compel INEC to move sensitive election materials in the custody of the CBN, in light of the involvement of CBN Governor in partisan politics.\n\nYouths protest, say Emefiele denigrated CBN Act\n\nMeanwhile, the National Youth Council of Nigeria has protested against what it described as the denigration of the CBN Act by Emefiele, whose presidential ambition for the 2023 election has generated a national outcry.\n\nWhile declaring that the CBN governor has dragged a revered institution of government into partisan politics, the NYCN said it shall consult widely and take appropriate actions.\n\nThe President of NYCN, Solomon Adodo, stated these during the launch of the Youth-Run Campaign in Abuja on Tuesday with the theme, \u2018Youth rising for a united Nigeria.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the light of the current developments of searching for credible leaders at all levels we herein state the following :\n\n\u201cOur doors are open to all aspirants across all party lines for proper consultation. Aspirants must show their clear plans for the youth and seal a pact of partnership to ensure youth potentials are moved to productivity.\n\nWe\u2019ll await court order to decide Emefiele\u2019s fate, says Presidency\n\nThe Presidency on Tuesday said it would wait for the decision of the court before deciding the fate of the CBN governor.\n\nBut the Presidency on Tuesday said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), would not sack the CBN chief until the court reached a final decision on the issue on May 12.\n\nSpeaking to The PUNCH on Tuesday, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said, \u201cSince this matter is before a judge, we will rather wait for the court to decide.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nThe Military Pensions Board (MPB) has completed the payment of the second tranche of 25 per cent of the arrears of minimum wage increments to eligible military retirees which commenced on Friday 6 May 2022 with the conclusion of the exercise on Tuesday 10 May 2022.\n\nIn the regard, the Military Pensions Board has fulfilled the commitment it made to thousands of ex-soldiers and officers whom it promised the arrears will be paid as soon funds for the payments were released.\n\nChairman, Military Pensions Board, Rear Admiral Saburi Abayomi Lawal who confirmed the payment in Abuja in a statement he personally signed, said, \u201cThe payments were made to the various bank accounts of pensioners on the MPB payroll. Consequently, all eligible military pensioners are advised to contact their banks for their entitlements.\n\nRear Admiral Lawal said, \u201cThis payment is the second instalment being paid to eligible military retirees who are active on the Board\u2019s data base and it is in fulfilment of the agreement reached between the Board and the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning (FMoFBNP) for quarterly releases of the appropriated sum in the first month of each quarter of this year.\n\n\u201cIt is important to state that these payments are basically for arrears of increment in pensions of military retirees who are on MPB payroll between 18 April 2019 and 30 April 2021, occasioned by the new National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Act 2019.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to inform that all Next of Kins (NOKs) of deceased military pensioners who are entitled to these same arrears have been paid in full.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Board would like to inform our esteemed retirees and the general public that the MPB is up to date in the payment of monthly pensions and gratuities to our military pensioners/retirees and has fully settled the death benefits of all confirmed NOKs of deceased military personnel/pensioners.\n\n\u201cThese accomplishments are made possible through the immense support the Board has continually received from the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Defence and the FMoFBNP, which has ensured regular releases of funds to the Board.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our esteemed military pensioners therefore, the Board wishes to thank President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR for his immense support to the Board and military retirees.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Board extends its appreciation to the Hon Minister of Defence, Maj Gen BS Magashi (Rtd), the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen LEO Irabor as well as the Service Chiefs for their constant support to the Board towards meeting its constitutional mandates.\n\n\u201cThe MPB wishes to assure our esteemed military retirees/pensioners, NOKs of deceased military personnel and other well-meaning Nigerians that the Board remains resolute and will ensure complete payment of the 24 months Minimum Wage arrears before the end of the year, subject to release of funds by the FMoFBNP.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking you all for your patience, understanding and continued support, please accept my esteemed regards as always.\u201d\n\nRecall that the payment of the first tranche of the payment of arrears of the minimum wage increment was made in February this year and over 90, 000 retired military pensioners who are alive and active were paid 25 per cent of the arrears of salary increment.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Nigeria is regarded as Africa\u2019s largest ICT market with 82 per cent of the continent\u2019s telecoms subscribers and 29 per cent of internet usage.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is also projected to be the fastest growing region with a compound annual growth rate of 4.6 per cent and a subscriber enrolment of over 167 million in the next five years. Nigeria is expected to account for over 55 per cent of this.\n\n\n\nThe NCC estimates that the country has about 76 million subscriptions on broadband which accounts for 40 per cent penetration and 195.4 million telecom subscribers as of December 2021.\n\n\n\nThe government of Nigeria recognizes ICT as the enabler for developing other critical sectors including education, healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. In its drive to diversify the economy from oil and gas, the federal government is encouraging partnerships between local ICT companies and foreign investors. To promote these partnerships and grow an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the technology sector, the country has supported creating government- or private-sector led incubator hubs, youth innovation programs, and science technology parks.\n\nAbuja Technology Village, which serves as an example, received government support to become a destination for research, incubation, development, and commercialization of ICT.\n\nConstruction has begun at the site, and the government has granted Special Economic Zone status to Abuja Technology Village and other hubs to enable duty-free shipments and elimination of labour issues as a fiscal incentive to investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nSpeaking at a two-day National Conference on Non-oil Export with the theme, \u2018Export for Survival: Optimising Nigeria\u2019s Non-oil Export Potential\u2019, organised by the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) recently, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo said \u201csome of the country\u2019s best stories are in the tech sector, with companies valued over $1billion each and all of these between two recessions.\u201d\n\nHe said the tech sector is growing so well because there is a very large hand of the regulator upon it and added that \u201cthe country must seek to achieve a situation where regulators see themselves as facilitators of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been the focus of the ministry of Industry Trade and Investment especially with the MSME clinics where we try to show that the very best approach is for regulators to see themselves as those that must promote business,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\nOsinbajo said the government\u2019s job is to enable businesses especially with the regulatory policies.\n\n\u201cThe core mandate of the Presidential enabling business environment council found expression in the master action plan of 7.0 on the ease of doing business and in the way to consolidate and removal of regulatory constraints especially around agro-export and to drive the electronic filing of taxes and publication of insolvency regulation of companies and Allied matters Act 2020.\n\nThe 7.0.agro export plan prioritizes trade facilitation reforms to minimize cross border trade and transport logistics and for Nigerian companies to do better and to be more compliant with the AFCTA export compliance regulations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe plan for reduction of cargo clearance time has also begun with the facilitation of imports and exports with the introduction of installation of scanners supported also by the port community portal. One of the major problems and complaints that we have is that there is always physical inspection of goods as they come, but with the scanners we hope physical inspection will be greatly reduced.\n\n\u201cWe have continued to meet the challenges facing us head-on and there are so many challenges, the government\u2019s commitment to infrastructural development and also looking for ways of funding the exports in trade and investment is one commitment that the government has taken very seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, Dr. Ezra Yakusak, observed that report from Pre-shipment Inspection Agencies (PIA) revealed a significant growth in export proceeds in the last 5 years 2017-2021 from $1.2 billion to $3.4 billion as against an annual average of $22 billion food importation alone into the country. \u201cTo close this gap, concerted efforts are required from all practitioners in the non-oil export value chain,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking on the theme \u201cSustainable Market Access for Nigerian Non-oil Export,\u201d Ambassador Adamu Mohammed Abdulhamid, Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said the negative impact on Nigeria\u2019s external reserve has exerted unprecedented pressure on Naira and weakened Nigeria\u2019s ability to finance its import and undermine its Balance of Payment position.\n\nHe cited increased poverty and livelihood security difficulties and unemployment as part of the aftermath of these negative indices.\n\nIn order to build a resilient economy, Economic Diversification and digitization especially export diversification is key.",

He is a phenomenally wily politician.\u201d\n\nAmadi said in terms of policy intelligence, Saraki is arguably Nigeria\u2019s best due to his knack for assembling policy ideas that are in the main transformative.\n\nHe hailed the aspirant for leading the most innovative 8th National Assembly that tried to enact laws that will promote economic growth.\n\nThe Harvard alumni said whether he will maintain the required integrity and selflessness to implement some of the ideas needed to transform Nigeria is a different matter.\n\nAmadi further noted that Saraki\u2019s tenure in Kwara did not produce much in terms of real development but rather was shrouded in allegations of corruption.\n\n\u201cSaraki can be a great President.

          "text": "The Chairman of the Body of Benchers (BoB), Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), has described as unconstitutional, immoral and a threat to the nation\u2019s democracy the call by Robert Clarke (SAN) on President Muhammadu Buhari to extend his tenure on account of the nation\u2019s security challenge.\n\nOlanipekun, who currently heads the highest body of law experts in Nigeria (BoB), argued in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, that no provision in the Constitution supports Clarke\u2019s proposition, noting that the only situation where the election could be shifted is when the nation is at war with a foreign country as provided in Section 135(3).\n\nThe former President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) contended that the current security challenge in the country could not be equated with war envisaged under Section 135(3) of the Constitution and urged President Buhari to resist every temptation to stay in power at the expiration of his tenure.\n\nOlanipekun, who wondered why Clarke, who condemned ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s bid for a third term, would turn around to advise President Buhari to engage in direct breach of the Constitution, said Buhari was not expected to deal with all the nation\u2019s challenges before vacating office.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am afraid, I cannot agree with the postulations and prognosis of my learned friend of the Inner Bar (Clarke) as, same, with much respect to him, are not constitutional, legal, legitimate, moral, democratic, acceptable, reasonable, or in the best interest of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhile it is glaring that Nigeria is bedevilled by a mountain of daunting challenges, including insecurity, this cannot be any justification for a call for PMB or any President, howsoever, to extend his tenure outside the constitutionally provided maximum period of eight years, as prescribed by the combined provisions of sections 135(2) and 137(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\n\n\u201cWith further respect, the suggestion is a direct call to a breach of the Constitution, as well as its spirit, tenor and letter. There is no gainsaying the fact that the end result of such a proposition would further compound the conundrum that we have steeped into and, plunge us to a latent state of anomie.\n\n\u201cIt is quite disturbing, unfortunate, uncheering, and very worrisome that since 1999, Nigeria has been migrating from one problem to another, oscillating from one crisis to another; graduating from one degree of catastrophe to another; as a result of which the landscape has become a practising pitch for all sorts of theories, ideologies, ideas, suggestions, prognosis and hypothesis, the last of which has just come from the respected Chief Robert Clarke, SAN.\n\n\u201cAs stated earlier, this suggestion, if considered at all, how much being implemented, would no doubt aggravate our already compounded woes and terminate the survival of the present democratic adventure. It is apt to caution, applying the old adage: \u2018ye deity, if you cannot improve or salvage my situation, leave me as you have met me.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo PMB, my honest, friendly, professional and civic advice is that he should treat this advice or any invitation to him to extend his tenure by a millisecond beyond 29th May 2023, with a pinch of salt.

          "title": "APC Ticket: Jonathan Gives Conditions, Sale of Forms Extended to May 12",
          "text": "\u2022Former president joining our party, running for office will be one of the wonders of the century, says Umahi\n\n\u2022N100m forms: Presidential aspirant defects, alleges party has commercialised primary process\n\n\u2022High cost of APC, PDP presidential forms worries Kukah\n\n\u2022Warns Nigerians unwittingly pushing for plutocracy\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\n\n\nFresh facts have emerged from the recent meeting in Abuja between the former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, and National Chairman of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, which was held behind closed doors.\n\nThe revelation from the meeting emerged just as the APC last night extended the sale of its nomination and expression of interest forms to Thursday May 12, 2022, while aspirants who had already bought forms are now expected to start submitting same on Friday May 13. According to a three-paragraph statement from the ruling party, although the original deadline for sale of forms was yesterday, the two work-free days observed last week were said to have encroached into the original timetable. Hence, the extension.\n\n\u201cFollowing the new submission date, APC has fixed Saturday May 14 and Sunday May 15 for screening of all aspirants that have returned their duly completed and signed nomination and expression of interest forms to the APC Secretariat,\u201d it added.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu took place amid wide speculation that APC was hatching a deal with the former president to adopt him as the party\u2019s presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nBut a reliable source said Jonathan, currently a member of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), told Adamu he would join the presidential race on the ruling party\u2019s platform only if he was assured of being made the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, also a presidential aspirant under APC, said the participation of Jonathan in the party\u2019s presidential primaries this month would be another wonder of the world.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came as one of the presidential aspirants on the APC platform, Adamu Garba, left the party yesterday over the N100 million cost of its presidential nomination and expression of interest forms. Garba said the humongous sum was tantamount to commercialisation of the APC presidential ticket.\n\nIn a similar vein, Catholic Bishop of the Sokoto Diocese, His Grace Matthew Hassan Kukah, expressed worry over the huge amounts being charged presidential aspirants by the two major political parties, APC and PDP. Kukah said the country was walking the fine line between democracy and plutocracy, but might soon jettison the former.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu took place few hours after a Fulani group, under the aegis of Nomadic Pastoralists and the Almajiri Communities, purchased the ruling party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms for the former president.\n\nHowever, THISDAY reliably learnt late last night that people like Chief Mike Oghiadomhe, Jonathan\u2019s Chief of Staff while he was in office and some other close aides to the former president are opposed to him running at all because they feel he would be disgraced down the line. \u201cThey were the people that drafted the hard-line press statement earlier yesterday, which was withdrawn few minutes after for the statement currently in circulation, because they don\u2019t want him to run. As you may have noticed, the second statement was watered down version of the first one \u201d\n\nThe source who is familiar with the ongoing talks disclosed, \u201cThe former president just wants a coronation as the presidential ticket bearer.\u201d\n\nThe response of the APC chairman to Jonathan\u2019s request for consensus presidential ticket was not clear. But THISDAY learnt that while only President Muhammadu Buhari could give the final approval for such an agreement, interest groups within the party would oppose such an arrangement.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s findings further revealed that in the one-hour meeting between Jonathan and Adamu, the demand of the former president was neither rejected nor accepted.\n\nThe meeting, held between 9pm and 10pm, and was organised in a bid to sort out grey issues concerning Jonathan\u2019s bid to fly the APC presidential flag in next year\u2019s poll.\n\nIt was gathered that if the consensus candidacy deal goes through, the former president might have the governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, as his running mate.\n\n\u201cGranting him his request as a consensus candidate is still dicey because of the presidential declaration of Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source, who is one of Jonathan\u2019s relations, told THISDAY, \u201cThe former president gave the condition that all hurdles that could stand against him becoming the consensus candidate of the APC should be cleared before he would formally join the APC and the presidential race.\n\n\u201cNothing is guaranteed. The meeting was part of the usual meetings since Sunday, but heightened with the purchase of the presidential form.\n\n\u201cYou could see that the first statement by Oga\u2019s aide said he was not consulted before the purchase of the presidential form and, therefore, it should be disregarded. The second statement from the same person was more subtle, stating that there is no commitment from the side of President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cFrom the two statements, one thing that is clear is that the APC national chairman did not confirm that he (Jonathan) will be the consensus presidential candidate. Abdullahi Adamu told him that he could not categorically assure that he will become the consensus candidate without further clarification from the president, who was outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe brother and former aide of Jonathan summed up the discussion at the meeting, thus, \u201cNothing was guaranteed and, hence, Oga said he was not committed to the pursuit of his presidential ambition on the platform of the APC.\u201d\n\nThe former aide said the grey issues to clear up regarding Jonathan\u2019s potential candidacy on the platform of APC included the proposed one-term of four years.\n\nAccording to reports, the confusion that followed the purchase of the presidential form for Jonathan arose because of the spirited efforts by his loyalists in PDP to dissuade him from joining APC and running on its platform. Jonathan\u2019s supporters were said to believe doing that would mean belittling his image.\n\nAnother reliable source said the former president had earlier met with the APC leadership last Sunday and concluded plans to accept the nomination form, but he was strongly discouraged by his close friends, who advised him to remain in PDP.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThese people have been pressurising Jonathan until the very last minute not to accept to run on the APC ticket, no matter how tempting the conditions may be.\n\n\u201cThat was why the former president did not present himself to the APC national chairman on Sunday, when the form was to be formally presented to him by the Almajiri group, who wanted to show him appreciation for what he did for them during his tenure by building schools and rehabilitating them.\u201d\n\nThe source, speaking on what prompted Jonathan to meet Adamu, said, \u201cThe main argument of those opposed to Jonathan running on the APC ticket is that it would be belittling to his image and standing in the world for him to do so, given where he has been and what he represents as a former president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut the point is that the deadline for picking the form is this week and if he does not accept the form, the window would be closed and the opportunity lost.\n\n\u201cThat was why the former president had to meet Adamu last night and their meeting was very productive, as both men came out happily at the end of the one-hour meeting in Adamu\u2019s house in Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of Bayelsa State chapter of APC, Dennis Otiotio, said the former president was at liberty to join the party, even though he was yet to register. Otiotio spoke to newsmen in a telephone interview, saying he is not aware of Jonathan\u2019s membership.\n\nThe APC state chairman said, \u201cThe former president is not yet a registered member of APC. He is free to join any party of his choice.\n\n\u201cWe are open and willing to receive him into our fold. As a political party desirous of winning elections, the only way to go is by admitting people into the party.\u201d\n\nFollowing the purchase of the presidential form for him, the former president had said in a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, that he was not aware of the development and did not authorise it.\n\nThe statement released on Monday read, \u201cIt has come to the notice of His Excellency, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms of the APC in his name. We wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 presidential election, we wish to state, that he has not in anyway, committed himself to this request.\n\n\u201cWe thank the general public for their concern, as we continue to encourage citizens\u2019 participation in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nJonathan Will Be a Hard Sell for APC, Says Umahi\n\nEbonyi State Governor Dave Umahi warned that Jonathan would be difficult to elect as APC\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2023 general election. The governor told newsmen yesterday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja, that it would be difficult for the ruling party to campaign with Jonathan as its presidential candidate.\n\nUmahi, who is one of the 26 presidential aspirants of APC, said although there had been denials of the former president\u2019s rumoured move to APC, if he eventually defected to the ruling party, it would be a material for the Guinness Book of Records. He wondered how APC would reconcile its policies and promises with those of PDP under which Jonathan was president from 2010 to 2015.\n\nAccording to Umahi, \u201cThe reason is that if you go and see the campaign programmes of APC and you now ask President Jonathan to come and run, I don\u2019t know what will be our campaign promises and what will be the stories we will be telling Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI believe strongly that he was not aware of the forms and I want to believe that people that are mischievous would have bought the forms to embarrass him.\n\n\u201cBut from what I read, he has quickly distanced himself from that. Like I said, if that is not the case, then the Guinness Book of Records is not totally filled up.\u201d\n\nOn his views about Jonathan joining the presidential race, the governor recounted that God used the former president and his wife for him to emerge as Ebonyi State governor seven years ago.\n\nUmahi stated, \u201cJonathan is my father and God used him and the wife to make me governor of the state and so, anybody who has done anything for me, I\u2019ve always remained very grateful to such a person and I will continue to be very grateful to him, the wife for being available and my destiny helper.\n\n\u201cProbably if that miracle did not take place, then the miracles that happened in Ebonyi State, in terms of total evolution and transformation, wouldn\u2019t have taken place.\n\n\u201cSo, he is a man we cannot forget, just like Sani Abacha, who created the state and Mr. President. Of course, we have named the airport after him, we have named the light tunnel after him, we have named the Presidential Lodge after him.\u201d\n\nUmahi, however, stressed that it would be a wonder ran for president on the APC platform.\n\nHe stated, \u201cGood intention that we don\u2019t forget people who have helped us, but on the question of joining, I may not say much about that because I\u2019ve seen a lot of write ups, denials, but if he decides to join and to run, it will, for me, become one of the wonders in this century.\u201d\n\nN100m Form: APC Presidential Aspirant Defects, Alleges Adamu Has Commercialised Primary Process\n\nAdamu Garba announced his defection from APC yesterday, saying he would disclose his new party within the next few days. He advised those who had contributed money to his campaign to seek refund immediately.\n\nGarba spoke at a news conference in Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have recorded the sum of N81, 750,000.00 in private donations and N1, 457, 794.70 in online donations, totalling N83, 207,794.70.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely, immensely, and graciously thank everyone for these wonderful contributions and donations, including those who made theirs anonymously.\n\n\u201cWe, however, request that all those who donated online and who require a refund send an email with evidence of payment to adamugarba@adamugarba.org. I assure you of a complete refund upon request.\n\n\u201cThose that made private donations, we know them, we will meet them and settle this out.\u201d\n\nGarba added, \u201cIncidentally, if your donations are done for pursuing our course for the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the coming 2023 election, the battle is not over yet. Kindly do bear with us for further directives in the coming days.\n\n\u201cI deeply, immensely appreciate my supporters, friends, well-wishers, and the well-meaning Nigerian youth who contributed unceasingly to this journey.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of APC had commercialised the process leading to the emergence of a credible candidate for the party in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe also expressed fear that the leadership of the party could further compromise the process with the inclusion of the voluntary withdrawal form in the nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nGarba predicted that the NWC might adopt consensus to pick an anointed candidate and ask other aspirants, who had obtained forms with N100 million, to seek refund.\n\nHe maintained that the NWC\u2019s latest directive that 10 statutory delegates must sign the forms of the aspirants had automatically made the party\u2019s ticket accessible only to the highest bidder.\n\nAccording to Garba, \u201cInformation at our disposal has it that some aspirants are paying as much as N50, 000 to each statutory delegate to get their forms signed.\n\n\u201cAfter high-level deliberation with our internal campaign team, we have concluded that we will not be obtaining the expression of interest and nomination form for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the platform of the APC.\u201d\n\nNigerians Unwittingly Pushing for Plutocracy, Says Kukah\n\nCatholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, His Grace Matthew Hassan Kukah, spoke on the topic, \u201cCitizens Participation in a Democracy,\u201d during a brief ceremony to mark the 60th birthday of veteran civil society activist, and Director of the Policy and Legislative Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Mr. Clement Nwankwo. Kukah said Nigeria could not get the right citizens\u2019 participation in governance if people did not believe in the constitution or the electoral process.\n\nHe said some of the bizarre things \u201cbeing witnessed today in our democracy have tended exclude citizens from participation in governance.\u201d\n\nKukah explained, \u201cWe went for democracy because we think it is the best form of government, but as it is now, if you want to declare interest to participate in the process or to pick your expression of interest form, despite the quality of your certificate, you went to Harvard, you went to Oxford and you went to that other institution.\n\n\u201cThis is not about your ability, no, it is not acceptable, if you don\u2019t have N100 million or N50 million to buy a nomination form or you don\u2019t have the kind of friends that can buy it for you.\n\n\u201cYou see, this thing has been reduced to some kind of joke and Nigerians are sitting and watching in disbelieve and keeping quiet, that somebody will just wake up one day to pick a nomination form for N100 million, that person may not have been able to drill a borehole for his village or give scholarship to his people.\n\n\u201cWe have to pay the price because we are complicit. What this means is that someone fixed the price saying that poor people don\u2019t have to apply, that only rich people can participate in the process. We should not pretend that we are running a democracy, we are rather pushing for plutocracy \u2013 government of the rich for the rich people.\u201d\n\nKukah said every country deserved the quality of leadership it had constructed, adding that in Nigeria\u2019s case, bad leadership has given birth to the monster of insecurity now haunting everyone.\n\nAccording to Kukah, constitution is a major factor that helps in uniting citizens and promoting good governance in any country.\n\nThe fiery cleric regretted that Nigeria\u2019s constitution had remained an issue of contention and debate for many years. He also said the issue of citizenship in the country was still in suspended animation, adding that the simplest thing that a citizen should enjoy from the state had remained elusive.\n\nKukah said there was need to find ways to manage ethnic and religious diversity if Nigeria was to attain true nationhood.\n\nEarlier, the celebrant said Kukah had been a pillar of support for civil society groups for many decades.\n\nNwankwo recalled a memorable event in his life, when he got married to his wife in 1996 with Bishop Kukah officiating. He narrated how he had to sneak out from one of the foreign embassies to attend the wedding during the military rule.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022House to do same today\n\n\u2022But will Buhari sign?\n\nSunday Aborisade and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Senate yesterday amended the Electoral Act, 2022, to allow \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 \u2013 all those elected \u2013 to participate and vote in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties.\n\nSimilarly, the House of Representatives would today hold an emergency plenary session to re-amend the Electoral Act which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on February 25, 2022.\n\nHowever, analysts are wondering if the president would sign the bill if passed by the National Assembly following what happened to the previous electoral bill where they reached an agreement that they would amend the legislation and the lawmakers reneged.\n\n\u201c There is also the question: How can they change the rules in the middle of the race? As it is now, the electoral process has started, so why do they want to change the rules when the processes have already started?. But the most important issue here is that last time they reached an agreement on this matter, the National Assembly did not live up to its own commitment to the president,\u201d a political analyst who pleaded anonymity said.\n\nHe further pointed out that the president has 30 days to either sign or withhold assent, by then all the primaries would have been done. So of what purpose is the rushed amendment?\n\nThe decision at the Red Chamber followed the expeditious consideration of a bill during plenary which scaled first, second and third readings, respectively, and was passed during plenary by the chamber after consideration by the Committee of the Whole.\n\nThose identified as \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 include the President, Vice President, Members of the National Assembly, Governors and their deputies, Members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Councils, Councillors, National Working Committee of political parties, amongst others.\n\nThe bill to amend the 2022 Electoral Act No. 13 was sponsored by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege (Delta Central).\n\nOmo-Agege, in his presentation, said the bill seeks to amend the provision of section 84(8) of the Electoral Act.\n\nAccording to him, the provisions of the section \u201cdoes not provide for the participation of what is generally known as \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe extant section only clearly provides for the participation of elected delegates in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties held to nominate candidates of political parties.\n\n\u201cThis is an unintended error, and we can only correct it with this amendment now before us,\u201d the Deputy Senate President said.\n\nSpeaking after the bill to amend the 2022 Electoral Act was passed, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, said the amendment became imperative in view of the deficiency created by the provision of section 84(8) of the extant Act.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe amended Electoral Act of 2022 that we passed this year, has a deficiency that was never intended and that deficiency will deny all statutory delegates in all political parties from participation in congresses and conventions.\n\n\u201cAnd, therefore, such a major and unintended clause has to be amended before the party primaries starts in the next eight days. This is an emergency legislation, so to speak.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that the National Assembly \u2013 the two chambers \u2013 would finish with the processing of this amendment of this bill, between today (in the Senate) and tomorrow (in the House of Representatives), and then the Executive will do the assent.\n\n\u201cThat is so important to enable every statutory delegate to participate in the party primaries right from the beginning that will start on the 18th of May, 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this is an emergency effort to ensure that nobody is denied his or her rightful opportunity as a delegate, especially the statutory delegates, and these are those who are elected.\n\n\u201cThese are the president, vice president, members of the National Assembly, governors, members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Council and their Councillors, National Working Committee Members of all the political parties and so on.\n\n\u201cThis is a fundamental effort to ensure that we address this within the week, so that by next week, the Electoral Act, 2022 (amended version), will be very salutary for us to start our party primaries.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the House of Representatives would today hold an emergency plenary session on the matter.\n\nThe lawmakers had on May 4, adjourned plenary to May 24, to enable the lawmakers seeking reelection to take part in their primaries scheduled for May 22.\n\nIn a circular issued by the Clerk of the House, Dr. Yahaya Danzaria, he said the session became necessary to amend a fundamental error in the Act.\n\nThe circular read: \u201cThis is to inform all Hon. Members, staff, media and the general public that the House hereby reconvenes for an emergency plenary session against tomorrow, Wednesday, 11th May, 2022 at 11:00am.\n\n\u201cThis session has become necessary especially as to amend a fundamental error in the Electoral Act. The House regrets this short notice and implores all Members to be present.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has come under criticism over its inability to publish its annual reports detailing operations and financial obligations since 2018.\n\nAccording to Premium Times, checks showed that since 2005 when the Bankers Bank started publishing details of its annual report on its website, it has failed to publish the crucial financial records from 2018.\n\nAccording to the CBN Act 2007, the apex bank is expected to publish its report within two months after the end of each financial year.\n\n\u201cThe Bank shall, within two months after the close of each financial year, transmit to the National Assembly and the President a copy of its annual accounts certified by the Auditor,\u201d the CBN Act reads in part.\n\n\u201cA report required to be submitted to the National Assembly and the President shall be published by the Bank in such manner as the Governor may direct.\n\n\u201cThe Board shall ensure that accounts submitted pursuant to this section shall as soon as possible be published in the Gazette.\n\n\u201cThe Bank shall as soon as may be practicable after the last day of each month makeup end publish a return of its assets and liabilities as at the close of business on that day, or if that day is a holiday, as at the close of business on the last preceding business day,\u201d the Act reads.\n\nAnalysts said that the failure of the CBN to publish the report could send wrong signals to investors and others interested in understanding the state of the economy.\n\nThe paper noted that the apex Bank has faced criticisms regarding the management of the country\u2019s economy despite the skyrocketing food prices and other inflationary pressures.\n\nIt should be recalled that the apex bank has kept the country\u2019s interest rate at 11.5 percent since September 2020 when it reduced the monetary policy rate from 12.5 percent.\n\nThe bank has also been struggled to ensure liquidity amid depleting reserves. It has also been criticised for its management of the naira and its controversial financing of the federal government\u2019s deficits.\n\nAt a public presentation of the 2020 approved budget in January, Nigeria\u2019s Minister for Finance, Zainab Ahmed, revealed that revenue shortfall and increased expenditure resulted in a fiscal deficit of about N6.1 trillion as against the N4.6 trillion budgeted by the government.\n\nThe minister revealed that the deficit was financed with a N2 trillion borrowing from the domestic market, a N1.2 trillion from foreign markets, and a N2.8 trillion obtained from the CBN. The CBN\u2019s intervention came in the form of Ways and Means, as provided for in the CBN Act.\n\nExperts, global financial institutions, and rating agencies have continually warned of the danger the CBN\u2019s intervention portends for the macroeconomic stability of the country.\n\nIn its 2018 report, the bank\u2019s last published report, the apex bank said the country\u2019s economy showed considerable resilience during the year, especially when compared to its peers.\n\n\u201cOverall GDP growth quickened to 1.9 percent in 2018 from 0.8 percent in 2017. Though this growth rate is below the pre-recession average of over 5.0 percent, the positive outturn which reflected the continued rebound of the Nigerian economy is gratifying,\u201d the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, amid widespread criticism of its handling of the naira and other monetary policies, the governor of the bank, Godwin Emefiele, has come under serious fire for getting involved in partisan politics.\n\nIn the last few weeks, several campaign groups have come out to campaign for the election of Emefiele as Nigeria\u2019s next president.\n\nThe campaign infuriated many Nigerians, who called for his resignation or outright dismissal. But in his reaction, Emefiele said that he was focused on strengthening the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThings took a dramatic turn when on May 5, Emefiele filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja through his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, contesting his eligibility to run for Nigeria\u2019s president while in office as the CBN governor.\n\nHe argued that no law exempted him from contesting the primary election of any political party as a sitting CBN governor.\n\nAlthough the case is still in court, many Nigerians have condemned the CBN Governor for desecrating his sensitive position as chief custodian of the apex bank.",

He became the president in May 2010 following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and completed the latter\u2019s tenure.\n\nHe won the 2011 presidential election, but lost his attempt to secure a second term in office in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome groups procured the presidential form of the All Progressives Congress for the former president, which he rejected.\n\nIn April, Femi Falana, human rights advocate, argued that section 137(3) of the constitution disqualifies Jonathan from contesting, adding that the former president would spend a cumulative period of nine years as president if wins the 2023 presidential election,\n\nMike Ozekhome, senior advocate of Nigeria, countered Falana, saying Jonathan is \u201cconstitutionally\u201d qualified to contest for president in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining the fray, Agbakoba, in a legal opinion, said the amended section 137(3) of the 1999 constitution does not apply to Jonathan since the clause was not in existence when he was a president.\n\n\u201cThe eligibility of Former President Goodluck Jonathan to run for the office of President has become a vexed issue.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to give back to the African continent, the Bantaba way",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favourite lines from Jidenna\u2019s 85 to Africa project is from the song Worth the Weight. The song features Seun Kuti, and the following monologue from the artiste probably captures some of what community-driven platform, Bantaba is doing.\n\n\u201cI believe it is time for an African people-powered highway. A highway that will connect the diaspora and the motherland. A global highway for African people all over the world to rediscover themselves and remember that the only thing that unites black people globally, the only thing we have in common, is that we are from Africa.\u201d\n\nWhen most of us hear the word diaspora, what comes to mind is in-laws or relatives abroad. For some, this could mean gifts like clothes, toys, jewellery, or money (the holy grail), which we sometimes like to call remittances.\n\nLast year, people in the diaspora sent back $45 billion to family members and friends, and this amount depicts how much money comes into the African continent annually. Interestingly, despite World Bank predictions stating a possible 20% decline for low and middle-income countries due to the pandemic, that year, remittances declined by only 1.6%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn some countries like The Gambia, Lesotho, and Cape Verde, these remittances contribute considerably to their GDP.\n\nBut let\u2019s circle back to how these remittances come about. Many diasporans leave their country in search of better jobs and opportunities. Although some go to get an education, we could estimate that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre is almost always the former.\n\nIn the long run, this means that depending on the type of job and the length of stay, these diasporans attain some level of experience. Some of them work with big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, and some work with investment banks or companies.\n\nEssentially, there is a well of largely untapped diasporan knowledge.\n\nAt Bantaba, Lamin K. Darboe and his team of diasporans (and non-diasporans) are looking for ways to ensure this wealth of knowledge and cash trickles down to African tech startups that need them.\n\nOne of such diasporans is Pierre Jallow, a Gambian and the Founder and CEO of Webridge, a company that connects Nordic/Baltic businesses to the African market and vice versa. He is also the Co-founder of Remode, an entry-level accelerator.\n\nBut before his life in tech, Jallow was a professional basketball player. He moved around quite a bit and played in Finland (his current homeland) before moving to Russia and then back to Finland.\n\nThe way Jallow sees it, Bantaba is helping to expand the Ubuntu philosophy of \u201cI am because we are\u201d, which, for most people, has come to mean doing right by their family, tribe or community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you don\u2019t have to say, \u2018Okay, my remittances are only going to my parents or people in my family\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep my investments in Europe where it\u2019s not going to develop locally.\u2019But you are saying with my $10, $20k, I\u2019m going to invest in a due-diligence ready company, in a vetted company. That is the platform that Bantaba gives these investors.\u201d\n\nThe journey to Bantaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLamin K. Darboe. CEO and Co-founder of Bantaba\n\nWhen Darboe left the shores of Gambia for India in 2012, it wasn\u2019t because he had dreams of founding a startup. Far from that, in fact. Like most young people \u2014 sometimes a little older \u2014 leaving Africa, Darboe left to get an education.\n\nBut his journey to India would lead him to Italy.\n\n\u201cDuring the same year, I had another scholarship offer from a University in Milan, Italy, and that\u2019s how I moved to Italy, where I completed my undergraduate [studies] in finance. And then, like many finance graduates, the choice was maybe investment banking or consulting. So I tried to follow one of those routes.\u201d\n\nThat would take him to Ireland and then back to Italy, a decision that would introduce him to the startup world.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I was working with a partner who was an angel investor and had investments in many tech startups in Northern Italy.\u201d\n\nIn August 2019, Darboe moved to Stockholm for an MSc at the Stockholm School of Economics.\n\nIn June 2020, he met three other African students \u2014 Fabrice Ouedraogo, Eliane Birba, and Noufou Kafando \u2014 in a climate action challenge organised by Norrsken Foundation and Stockholm Innovation & Growth (Sting).\n\nAlthough they would eventually crash out, the stage had been set for future collaborations, and the current result is Bantaba.\n\nThe way Darboe explains it, Bantaba match makes diasporans with tech experience and who want to give back to the African continent through startups looking to raise capital, cultivate mentorship relationships, or receive consulting services.\n\nA way to think of this is by using the meaning of Bantaba. It\u2019s an ancient Manding word used to describe a large tree in the village square under which elders came to discuss things that affected everyone in the village.\n\nLikening this to the digital platform, Darboe describes Bantaba as a square-like convergence of the diaspora and tech startups to \u201caddress the challenges back home.\u201d\n\nWhat Bantaba is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we\u2019ve established what Bantaba is, what should you not mistake Bantaba for?\n\nFirst off, while it has similarities to (in)famous matchmaking platform, Tinder, in terms of matching tech startups in need of professional advice and funding with diasporans who can provide those things, finding love is not the goal. Darboe finds the idea \u201csexy,\u201d but unfortunately, not entirely representative of all Bantaba does.\n\nSide note: If you find love while using Bantaba, please reach out; I love to hear such stories.\n\nIt is also not LinkedIn. Although it creates a community of professionals, it is more focused on the diaspora and tech startups, a positive which Darboe believes can open room for monetisation in the future.\n\nAnother thought to scratch off the list is an accelerator or an incubator. Bantaba is none of those things, and while it does allow startups to create the kind of relationships you\u2019d get with those, it has a different approach.\n\nAlso, it is not strictly a platform to raise money. While that option exists, it is not the primary offering. Like the typical funding round, money is exchanged for equity. However, like GetEquity, a cap is placed on how much is raised. There is, however, no official market for secondaries.\n\nHowever, like with most community-centred apps, each user has a profile. But, before it is created, the startups and diasporans go through a vetting process to ensure that all is well. All the data provided is used to match startups and diasporans with similar needs.\n\nBantaba also provides Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Miro credits to startups on the platform based on the partnerships it has with these companies.\n\nIn the end, the idea was birthed out of Darboe and his co-founders\u2019 interests in engaging with the African continent, bridging the gap between the diaspora and the tech community, while building a community of experts and potential investors.\n\nCurrently, Bantaba takes a 5% fee off any successful funding deal they are directly involved in. This means that if a startup joined the platform to raise money and Bantaba matched them with an investor who proceeds to give them money, Bantaba makes money off this.\n\nWhile I wonder how sustainable this would be in the long run, Tomiwa Onaleye, Bantaba\u2019s Content Strategist, tells me the end goal is to earn enough money to \u201ckeep the company\u2019s lights on.\u201d\n\nThis is doubly tricky when you realise that a startup can make these connections on its own on the platform and possibly get funding without Bantaba knowing. But Onaleye says they are not necessarily bothered about that.\n\nSo far, Bantaba has raised $425,000 in pre-seed funding from Swedish angel investors. For subsequent rounds and keeping with their current business model, Onaleye says the company is in no rush to bring just any kind of investor on board.\n\nBut are there plans to open up the platform to non-diasporans?\n\nAlthough Darboe doesn\u2019t rule out this possibility, he makes a statement reminiscent of our introductory anecdote: \u201cI believe it is time for an African people-powered highway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is a good way for Africans to be part of their own development before you bring in other people.\u201d\n\nAnd Jallow agrees.\n\n\u201cNo country was developed by others. Every country in this world was developed by its own people. Whether you consider one of the countries in Europe or North America, they were developed by their own people.\n\n\u201cAnd the same goes for the African continent and the countries within the continent, and if its own people don\u2019t get up, we don\u2019t develop it. And I think this is the chance Bantaba creates.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 19, 2022, we opened applications for the TABS Web3 Hackathon, a competition that will reward original Web3/blockchain-based solutions to problems in different sectors of Africa\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Hackathon is a part of the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022), a blockchain/Web3-focused event that plans to make sense of the Web3 buzz and Africa\u2019s place in the space.\n\nThemed Web3: Engineering tomorrow\u2019s Internet, TABS 2022 is an opportunity to learn, network, and navigate the complex world of blockchain and its many promises.\n\nThough the Web3 space in Africa is nascent, the TABS Web3 Hackathon is a way to encourage innovative blockchain technology-based solutions. Blockchain is Africa\u2019s chance to play a vital role in developing one of the world\u2019s transformative technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored by Nairaex, winners of the Hackathon will go home with a total of $2,500 distributed to the first ($1,250), second ($750), and third ($500) placed finalists.\n\nWith an in-house team sifting through several registered teams, we have chosen the six finalists for the TABS Web3 Hackathon.\n\nThe teams were chosen based on the originality and uniqueness of their proposed solutions for the Hackathon. They will meet with the judges virtually in the next round, pitch their solutions, and get feedback on the best way to build them.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon finalists\n\nTeam Momoh Victor: Blockchain for financial inclusion\n\nTeam Momoh Victor\u2019s solution is a blockchain-powered system \u201cthat allows anyone who has a smartphone to create an account and a physical card for themselves and their loved ones.\u201d\n\nLed by Oluwatobi Babalola, the team is bullish on the possibility of building products that could aid financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nTeam Give: Credit facility for minting NFTs\n\nLed by Opeyemin Ajayi, Team Give wants to make minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) easier for those that do not have the resources to do so. Minting an NFT on Ethereum could cost between $70 and $300, and Team Give wants to create a credit facility that takes care of the cost of minting NFTs while you repay with interest.\n\nTeam ThrushBolt: Helping emerging talented artistes, music producers, and DJs to monetise their work with NFTs\n\nTeam ThrushBolt is also building an NFT-related solution for music. According to the team, talented artistes, music producers, and DJs can go beyond \u201cearning minute fractions of pennies per stream on platforms like Spotify\u201d to earning big with NFTs.\n\nLed by Agbo Ebuka, the Team TrushBolt wants to revolutionise how musicians earn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam Chemotronix: Blockchain for green energy\n\nPeace Bello is the team lead for Team Chemotronix. The team plans to use blockchain to solve climate-related problems.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to solve the current climate crisis issue. Blockchain would help secure net-zero investments by offering certifications for the green hydrogen market.\u201d\n\nTeam JPS: NFT market for digital fashion assets\n\nTeam JPS is merging blockchain with eCommerce but for virtual fashion accessories.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering who will buy fashion accessories they can\u2019t wear, Team JPS, led by Promise Adesemoye, has an exciting approach to its solution.\n\nThe solution is to \u201ccreate a marketplace for digital fashion assets which people can use for their social media by simulating on their pictures while also retaining the same value as an NFT.\u201d\n\nCould this also morph into fashion assets for avatars in the metaverse? I guess we\u2019ll find out at TABS 2022. Save a seat for yourself here.\n\nTeam Block baddies\n\nKhadijah Wraola Amusat hopes to lead Team Block baddies to victory with a solution that could help writers and authors get top dollar for their work.\n\nThey want to help authors list their books for sale in a marketplace like OpenSea but for books and articles.\n\nAccording to the Block baddies, \u201cthese books will be stored as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), meaning no one else can list or sell these books. Secondly, they would need permission from the owner before transferring it to another wallet account.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the books and articles can only be accessed on the blockchain, ruling out transfers by Bluetooth or email and making it impossible to duplicate after purchase.\n\nOur judges will select the best three solutions and decide which teams go home with the first, second, and third place cash prizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

Yeah, I know, a bit after the fact.\n\nWell, better late than never, and here I am again bringing you essential knowledge. Why? Because I value you. \ud83e\udd17\n\nAnyway, keep in mind that $2,500 in prizes is at stake here! We currently have six teams participating in this hackathon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to see the finalists live at TABS on Saturday, May 21, 2022, and learn about what they\u2019re currently working on. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to miss out on this.\n\nTo register to attend, click here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFinding satisfaction in marketing\n\nSouth Africa linking biometrics to SIM cards\n\nKenya\u2019s partnership with Netflix\n\nFinding satisfaction in marketing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\nMarketing may appear simple, but it is not; it entails more than just writing copies or running advertisements to promote a product.\n\nIt\u2019s hard because it acts as a bridge between product development and sales. This means you\u2019ll be collaborating with product managers and sales representatives. Imagine the horror.\n\nPlease, it\u2019s not horrifying. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m joking. In fact, if you know your onions, it can be a versatile, promising, and fun career.\n\nHowever, based on my limited experience working with Techpoint Africa\u2019s social media manager, Samuel, I can state unequivocally that it is not enjoyable. \ud83d\ude02\n\nOh yes, it\u2019s not appealing to me! \ud83d\ude2d Please accept my apologies if it appears that I have failed you, Samuel. It\u2019s not enjoyable because I\u2019m essentially an intermediary, and you know what that entails. If you don\u2019t know, forget about it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, I admire marketers because they have brilliant ideas. Honestly, they do. For example, Samuel does come up with brilliant ideas, which makes me wonder how easy it is for him.\n\nIs it because he\u2019s been in the industry for a while and has worked extensively with products and people? Well, I believe it is natural for him.\n\nInterestingly, for The Experts, we featured Saze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing at ART X Collective. In her words, she also \u201clikes big, bold, and audacious ideas.\u201d\n\nDid you know that Saze was one of the organisers of TEDx Ikoyi, one of Nigeria\u2019s first TEDx events?\n\nAlso, in 2012, she served as Jumia\u2019s Product Manager and Marketing Partnerships Manager. Plus, she joined Facebook in 2016 as a growth manager.\n\nEnough with the gist. You can read more about her story here: How Saze Ibraheem found satisfaction in marketing\n\nSouth Africa to link biometric data to SIM cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) proposed linking biometric data \u2014 like fingerprint mapping, facial recognition, and retina scans \u2014 to SIM cards in the draft regulations.\n\nThis suggests that if the proposal is successful, new regulations would require all South Africans to provide biometric data to mobile service providers to obtain a new phone number or perform a SIM swap.\n\nWhy the proposal? Gur Geva, Co-Founder and CEO of iiDENTIFii \u2014 a remote biometric digital facial authentication and automated onboarding technology \u2014 says the new proposal aims to prevent serious crime and protect consumers from the financial and emotional trauma of identity fraud where associated phone numbers are used.\n\nSouth African fraudsters are reportedly expanding their digital schemes against businesses. In the first quarter of 2021, the percentage of suspected fraudulent digital transaction attempts against South African companies increased by 43.62%.\n\nAccording to ICASA, stricter security measures are needed to prevent the hijacking of mobile phone numbers via porting or a SIM swap transaction, among other instances of fraudulent activity.\n\nConsequently, Geva claims that the technology used to connect biometrics to SIM cards is well-established and, more importantly, safe and secure.\n\nSo far, over 21,000 South Africans have objected to the draft regulations, published at the end of March 2022. Opponents argue that such policies are authoritarian and violate people\u2019s privacy.\n\nWhy? The country has dealt with data breaches in the past but has yet to implement several critical components of the 2013 Protection of Personal Information Act.\n\nConsequently, privacy advocates are concerned that the government may be unable to protect the biometric data it collects and that corrupt officials may leak sensitive personal information to cybercriminals.\n\nHowever, public comment on the draft regulations will be closed today, May 11, 2022. What will the South African government do? Will they proceed with the draft regulations or not? What do you think?\n\nKenya\u2019s ministry of ICT partners with Netflix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, Kenya\u2019s Ministry of ICT, Innovation, and Youth Affairs signed a two-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Netflix to strengthen the country\u2019s creative industry and support the development of the next generation of storytellers.\n\nWhat does the MoU focus on?

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade, commerce, and the entire system of value exchange are no longer confined to the geographical boundaries of one country. These days, businesses strive to reach a global audience, leveraging the power of technology to achieve results. However, despite the efforts of businesses (both small and large scale) to tap into the potential of borderless transactions, they have continually faced a series of challenges, prominent among them are the exorbitant charges of traditional banks and fintechs, and the unfavourable fluctuation in value of national currencies. This is especially true for businesses in emerging markets across Africa, Asia, South America, and the rest of the world. This is without considering the periodic shifts and changes to governmental regulations in these countries.\n\nAs a way out, IvoryPay aims to help businesses, merchants, and creators maximise gains by providing them with an alternative route to making and receiving payments. Built on the Solana blockchain, IvoryPay\u2019s aim is to help online businesses facilitate bankless transactions through cryptocurrency. With IvoryPay, businesses in emerging markets will be able to reduce the cost of transacting, increase transaction processing and payment confirmation speed, and accept payments in stable currencies.\n\nThe IvoryPay ecosystem comprises three components which include the Ivorypay payment gateway solution, the NFT Storefront, and the IVRY token. The payment gateway infrastructure helps online businesses easily accept payment in stablecoins and the IVRY token, offering customers the option to make payments using the most convenient means. Businesses on IvoryPay can accept payments using QR codes, checkout integrations, payment links, and buttons. The NFT Storefront will provide digital creators and businesses the opportunity to better monetize and diversify their revenue stream. Creators can choose from pre-existing templates to easily set up their storefront and be operational in no time, with an integrated payment system that allows them to sell the NFTs seamlessly. The IVRY token, which is the native cryptocurrency of the project will be used as a means of exchange between customers and merchants and it will also be used for staking purposes.\n\nThe idea to create an alternative means of payment facilitation that birthed IvoryPay was conceived by Oluwatobi Ajayi and Ope Akinremi, who are also Co founders of Uptrend Africa, one the biggest crypto marketing agencies in Africa championing grassroot cryptocurrency adoption. Oluwatobi who has worked in the crypto/alternative payment space over the past couple of years is of the belief that \u201cglobal businesses have reached a point where the barriers to trade should be non-existent and payment solutions should present businesses with multiple options with the end goal of simplifying payment processes and enhancing user experience without the need to break a sweat or empty your pocket in the process\u201d.\n\nOpe further added that \u201cconsumers are the backbone of the global economy and it is the foremost responsibility of all forward-thinking businesses to be in tune with the demands of their consumers. Thinking forward, in this case, would imply offering users the means to make payment in the manner they find most convenient, and trendy\u201d.\n\nWith the project in its development phase, it is only a matter of time before Ivorypay launches its robust payment architecture. The project could be a game-changer for online businesses in emerging markets and global commerce as a whole.\n\nFor more information, you can visit www.ivorypay.io.

          "text": "Here are APC presidential aspirants and their promises\n\nAhead of the primary election of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), many presidential aspirants have emerged despite the huge cost of the expression of interest and nomination forms.\n\nThe APC fixed its presidential nomination and expression of interest forms at N100 million.\n\nThe cost of the forms had generated criticisms from many Nigerians. Immediately after the cost of the forms was announced, several Nigerians took to social media to voice their concerns.\n\nThe ruling party has fixed May 30 and 31 for the election of its presidential, governorship and legislative candidates, through indirect primary. Political parties have until June 3 to submit the name of their candidates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nUnlike in 2019, there is a large number of aspirants who are jostling for the party\u2019s ticket; observers have expressed divergent views on the implications of the high number of presidential aspirants.\n\nSome political watchers believe that some of the aspirants are not serious about their ambition and are only in the race to negotiate their political future. They say many of them would not even go into the contest and would eventually bow out of the race at the last minute.\n\nThe aspirants are Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; Orji Kalu, former Abia governor and serving senator; Rochas Okorocha, former Imo governor and senator, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation; and Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment.\n\nOthers include Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti State governor; Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman of the party; Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta affairs; Muhammed Badaru Abubakar, Jigawa State Governor; Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a human rights activist and businessman; Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education, and Ibikunle Amosun, former governor of Ogun State.\n\nAhmed Lawan, the Senate president; Ben Ayade, Cross River Governor; Pastor Tunde Bakare; Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation; Former Senate President Ken Nnamani; Dimeji Bankole, former Speaker, House of Representatives; and Uju Kennedy, the only female aspirant, have also declared their intention to run.\n\nMost of the presidential aspirants have unfolded their agenda for the country, making various promises on what they would do to salvage Nigeria from its current problems, if they are given the opportunity to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAmong the issues that have dominated the agenda of aspirants in the APC are security, economic transformation, restructuring, and job creation.\n\nAkpabio promised to create jobs, provide infrastructure and bring restoration, dignity, respect and total transformation to the country.\n\nHe said he would re-enact his \u201cuncommon transformation\u201d feat achieved during his eight years of governor and as minority leader in the red chamber as well as minister of the Niger Delta affairs.\n\nNwajiuba said he would strive to transform Nigeria into a developed state and fight unemployment and poverty.\n\n\u201cAs we strive to uplift Nigeria and Nigerians into a developed state, a lot still is outstanding and needs to be done. Many of our citizens are still outside, hungry, unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo promised to transform the security, intelligence architecture, completing the reform of the justice system and focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel.\n\nRead also: Osinbajo: Experience, loyalty and character\n\nHe said his administration would ensure justice for all and the observance of rule of law, rapidly advancing infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity.\n\nOkorocha pledged to create an enabling economy, where productive activities and job creation would be the order of the day.\n\nThe senator also said he would make free education compulsory, especially from primary to secondary schools.\n\nAmaechi promised to rebuild the country, prioritise education, infrastructure and create an enabling environment for business to grow.\n\n\u201cI pledge my heart, mind and soul to the task of building a Nigeria in which every child can go to school, every young person can find work or support to start a business, every citizen can travel safely around the country and sleep at night,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nNgige said the Nigerian Police, as the agency in charge of homeland security, would be equipped with men and material to function optimally if becomes president.\n\nAccording to him, the decentralisation of Nigerian police is the way to go, so that governors of states can be chief security officers in name and in reality.\n\nBello promised to fight poverty and 20 million millionaires using crypto-related technology and the Igbo apprentice system.\n\n\u201cA Yahaya Bello administration or presidency will have an additional target of creating N20 million by the same year 2030 with the aim that each of them will empower five other citizens,\u201d the governor said.\n\nTinubu said he would transform the country to compete favourably with a country like Russia in the exploration of oil and gas.\n\nAccording to him, the country is blessed with abundant natural resources that are yet to be explored to enable it to be ranked among the best economies in the world.\n\nUmahi said he would replicate his feats as a governor at the national level.\n\nHe said his administration would create wealth to give jobs for unemployed Nigerians and also focus on education.\n\nOlawepo-Hashim said he would solve the insecurity crisis, worsening energy crises due to absence of local refining of petroleum products, and inadequate electricity generation, transmission and distribution if elected president.\n\nOshiomhole said he would ensure a stable academic calendar by ending the frequent strikes in the sector.\n\nThe former labour leader promised to review the tax system which would compel the rich to pay higher taxes required to address the basic needs of the country.\n\nAmosun promised to focus on national security, economic development, healthcare, education, agriculture and food security, infrastructural rural development, technology, innovation and digital economy, and nation-building.\n\nHe promised to transform the country within four years with unprecedented investment in human security.",

However, it must be noted that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, as it stands today, has been declared null and void by a court of competent jurisdiction. The issues need to be made clear by the courts.\u201d\n\nInibehe Effiong, a public interest and human rights lawyer and activist, said the CBN, \u201cbeing the extant regulatory body responsible for the financial future and that determines the monetary policies of the country, is supposed to be politically neutral and not to be mixed with partisan politics\u201d.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s top banker Emefiele in eye of the storm\n\n\u201cIt is also the height of irresponsibility that a said governor of the CBN will come out to say that he intends to contest for the office of a President or contest in the primaries of a political party during the currency of his term as a CBN governor,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN governor is a public servant, and under the code of conduct for public officers, a public officer is not supposed to do anything that conflicts with his duties and responsibilities.\n\nItem 1 Part 1 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 which provides for the Code of Conduct for Public Officers states that a public officer shall not put himself in a position where his personal interests conflict with his duties and responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIt is against the law and against morality that the governor should remain in office while he intends to run for the position of the President under the APC,\u201d Effiong said.\n\nAccording to the legal practitioners, the courts must promptly intervene to give a proper interpretation of the laws to guide the next actions.",

This is an emergency legislation, so to speak.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that the National Assembly \u2013 the two chambers \u2013 would finish with the processing of the amendment of this bill, between today (in the Senate) and tomorrow (House of Representatives), and then the Executive will do the assent.\n\n\u201cThat is so important to enable every statutory delegate to participate in the party primaries right from the beginning that will start on the 18th of May, 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this is an emergency effort to ensure that nobody is denied his or her rightful opportunity as a delegate, especially the statutory delegates, and these are those who are elected.\n\n\u201cThese are the President, Vice President, Members of the National Assembly, Governors, Members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Council and their Councillors, National Working Committee Members of all the political parties and so on.\n\n\u201cThis is a fundamental effort to ensure that we address this within the week, so that by next week, the Electoral Act, 2022 (amended version), will be very salutary for us to start our party primaries,\u201d Lawan added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "2023: Debunking the campaign against rotation of presidency",
          "text": "By Emma Nwosu\n\n\u201cThe new nation called Nigeria should be an estate of our grandfather, Othman Dan Fodio. We must ruthlessly prevent a change of power. We must use the minorities in the North as willing tools and the South as a conquered territory and never allow them to rule over us or have control over their future.\u201d \u2013 Sir Ahmadu Bello, The Parrot, October 12, 1960.\n\nThe evidence keeps mounting that the Fulani-led Moslem North truly take Nigeria as their estate and are more interested in subjugating others to cling to power, exclusively, than in the peace and prosperity of the country. Among others, it was to this end that the Northern Peoples\u2019 Congress (NPC) relentlessly hounded the opposition in the First Republic, the events of which triggered the termination of that Republic by coup d\u2019etat, followed by Civil War.\n\nThen, the Northern military establishment consecutively hijacked the Federal Government by coups d\u2019etat after the Civil War and leveraged on General Aguiyi Ironsi\u2019s Unification Decree of 1966, out of context, to bastardize the federal Constitution and structure agreed by the regions as the basis for independence \u2013 from four vibrant, semi-autonomous, regions to a unitary federation of 36 vassal states. Nineteen of those vassals (in addition to the Federal Capital Territory) were created in the erstwhile Northern Region while only 17 were created in all the three Southern Regions.\n\nEssential powers and resources were also confiscated from the states by the Federal Government. Merit was substituted with quota and patronage. And the coffin was nailed by Decree 24, in the pretext of the 1999 Constitution now in force, all to the advantage of the North \u2013 in terms of larger share of public revenues as well as the control of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial arms of government.\n\nThe resultant lack of correlation between talent and opportunity and reward and contribution has killed incentive and spelt death to diversified production and healthy competition between the federating units, leading to unmitigated economic failure and rendering the Nigerian system entirely predatory and bedeviled by inflation, unemployment, secessionist agitation and all shades of corruption and terrorism.\n\nCurrently, there is the invasion of the country by barbaric Fulani herdsmen, bandits and mercenaries, in the manner of an expeditionary force.\n\nAnd, to add insult to injury, there is also the vicious campaign against rotation of the Presidency, between the North and the South, enshrined in the Constitution of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) and practised since 1999, now that it is the turn of the South.\n\nEverything is being done to actualize Sir Ahmadu Bello\u2019s Doctrine of Supremacy of the Fulani-led Moslem North and, in particular, to foreclose the opportunity of a non-Fulani becoming President of Nigeria, henceforth, regardless of the deplorable condition of the country under their rule.\n\nIf the PDP ends up with a Northern Presidential candidate, the All Progressives Congress (APC) would follow suit, ostensibly, to divide the votes. Since Christians and other tribes of the North are not in the scheme of things, Nigeria might be saddled with another Fulani President on the heels of Muhammadu Buhari. The APC and the PDP are also headed by Northerners.\n\nSomehow, the rest of Nigeria have never truly challenged the Supremacy Doctrine, being wangled in many ways, but rather fall for every bait or fallacy while sleepwalking into slavery, even in the current campaign against rotation.\n\nOne of the campaigners\u2019 baits, meant to sway unprincipled politicians (who yearn for unbroken breastfeeding) away from rotation is that the PDP could not regain the Presidency in 2023 without the numerical strength of the North and that failure to present one of them would nail the coffin of the party and the fortunes of its members.\n\nBut, in truth, the presumed numerical strength of the North is not enough to win the Presidential election, as President Muhammadu Buhari can testify. The party must garner a collage of votes from two-third of the states \u2013 which neither the North nor the South alone can afford, despite the lopsided division of states. And, if gross voting population is the issue, why must the Northern candidate be Fulani again, instead of the more populous Hausa or Kanuri, for example?\n\nAnother bait is to the emotion of the peace and unity of the PDP and Nigeria: that zoning out the North (implicitly, the Fulani) would lead to acrimony. This is a betrayal of the supremacy mindset. Zoning out the South had never precipitated acrimony. Why should the case now be different? Why must the peace of Nigeria always depend on the docility of others except the Fulani?\n\nWhy not, for once, demonstrate mutual respect and reciprocate the sacrifice and concessions by Southerners since the First Republic? Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s case was circumstantial while Dr Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s was imperative and do not qualify as instances of deliberate support.\n\nThe fastest way to foster peace and unity in the PDP is to stick to the party\u2019s practice of rotation, with opportunity given to those who have never been President but whose fate it may be to turn things around. The fastest way to restore peace and unity in the country is to revert to the sort of Constitution and decentralized federal structure previously agreed by the regions.\n\nThe most annoying bait is that the Presidential ticket should be thrown open in search for the best candidate. The presumption is that such a candidate could only be found among them.\n\nThe truth is that the Fulani are focused on conquest but do not have much to offer in education and culture, science and technology, commerce and industry, arts and entertainment, sports, or anything that makes the society tick and were never supposed to lead Nigeria from behind but for the mistake of the NCNC in 1960, whereupon they have seized the stool.\n\nOne can only imagine Nigeria\u2019s global ranking, by now, had Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe or Chief Obafemi Awolowo been the first Prime Minister instead of Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa or Dr Alex Ekwueme President instead of Alhaji Shehu Shagari, or Professor Yemi Osinbajo instead of General Muhammadu Buhari. The economy, nurtured to the largest in Africa \u2013 with little or no public debt and a fairly stable Naira \u2013 by President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Goodluck Jonathan, successively, is all but dead now under President Muhammadu Buhari. It was also continuously devalued all through the days of the Northern military dictators.\n\nNone of the current Northern aspirants can compete (in credibility, prudence, extensive and complex knowledge and skill and energy for the Nigerian President at this time) with the typical Southern aspirant like Peter Obi. Is it the 76-year Atiku Abubakar who has been shopping for the title of President since 1993, or Bukola Saraki, the master of deception, who \u2018jumped fence\u2019 to snatch Senate Presidency, or Bala Mohammed who beckons on the Fulani from all around the world to swamp Nigeria?\n\nIf the Fulani were wonderful leaders, why is the North (particularly, the Northwest) which has been under their hegemony, the illiteracy, poverty, disease, corruption and terrorism capital of Nigeria \u2013 a grave demarketing factor if Nigerian voters were informed?\n\nIt has been a tale of the tail wagging the dog and a journey to perdition which may never be halted until the old Eastern and Western regions (who have been behaving like people under a spell) put their petty rivalry aside and come together to rescue Nigeria.\n\nThe most laughable bait is that the PDP would resume rotation of the Presidency after retrieving it in 2023 with a Northerner! Hahaha! What you could not wrestle from your opponent on a level ground, how would you retrieve it after he has been armed to the teeth with the Nigerian Presidency? Once this 2023 Rubicon is crossed, it is goodbye to rotation!\n\nThere is also the fallacy that the campaigners are motivated by the perception and hatred for the Igbo as most daring and most likely to upturn the apple cart \u2013 seeing that the pendulum of a Southern President is swinging towards the South-East.\n\nIt is the pure argumentum ad hominem and the height of impudence to block rotation because the likely beneficiaries are perceived as game changers, when Nigeria is in dire need of game changers. Evidently, clinging to power is more important to them than positive change.\n\nBoth Karma and the Law of Retribution stand against the exclusion (from political leadership and power) of those who were at the forefront of independence struggle and are also at the forefront of all that have kept Nigeria alive \u2013 from education, commerce and industry to sports and entertainment \u2013 and who have been the most loyal to the PDP since 1999. By implication, without an Igbo candidate, the PDP will lose the 2023 Presidential election.\n\nMoreover, the Igbo are not alone in the quest for a renegotiated and repositioned Nigeria, with devolution of powers to federating units \u2013 close to what obtained in the First Republic or to the Aburi Accord of 1967. It is in the absence of egalitarianism that some zones clamour to leave, in order to realize their suppressed potential, evident all around the world. Thus, beyond the Igbo, the demand for power rotation (in the interim) a new Constitution and a restructured federation will never cease and, if not addressed soon, will end in the disintegration of Nigeria.\n\nAbove all, the winner-takes-all supremacy doctrine is antithetical to the spirit of the Nigerian Constitution (as imperfect as it is) and to the sacrifice and concessions enjoyed by the North from the South over the years.\n\nThe centralization of regional resources and public revenues on the Federal Government (for redistribution to the advantage of the North) the provision of separate laws and Courts for Moslems in a secular country and the deprivation of some citizens of healthy competition and the destiny for excellence, through the obnoxious and perverted quota system, among others, point to the imperative of inclusiveness.\n\nBy the same spirit, national independence was deferred until the Northern Region was ready, once Sir Ahmadu Bello and the NPC threatened (in 1953) that the Region would, otherwise, secede. In 1960, they again threatened that the region would secede, if the NPC was not allowed to form the first independent Federal Government and were yet indulged.\n\nIn the 1959 election (for the first independent federal government of 1960) the NPC polled about 1.6 million votes, against Action Group\u2019s (AG\u2019s) 1.9 million and NCNC\u2019s 2.6 million and could not have formed that government had the NCNC not conceded it to them and accepted to be junior partners. But, thereafter, each time the NCNC or AG complained about election or census manipulation and asked for re-run, they were damned to go to court \u2013 literarily, to go to hell \u2013 the same manner in which the demand for a new Constitution, for restructuring and, now, for rotation of the Presidency, between the North and the South, are dismissed, today!\n\nIn 1993, Ibrahim Babangida annulled the election of Chief M. K. O. Abiola as President. Yet, in 2006, with the imminent end of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s Presidency, the Northern Governors Forum issued an ultimatum that the Presidency must return to the North and were supported by their Southern counterparts who were rather in the forefront to frustrate the alleged Third Term agenda of President Olusegun Obasanjo, with Ken. Nnamani as Senate President.\n\nIn summary, the same impetuous Fulani-led Moslem North, who always threatened to secede at the slightest delay of their demand, would always force down the throat of others what they would never accept to even taste. In particular, like dog in the manger, they are utterly contemptuous and implacable when it comes to the control of Nigeria while leading it downhill. Their argument against rotation is balderdash and they know it.\n\nRotation of the Presidency \u2013 which is a sensible template to give every part of Nigeria a sense of worth and a foot in the door of power \u2013 should, indeed, be constitutionalized. Meanwhile, it could be dumped only when the quota system and religious laws are dumped, with essential powers and resources returned to federating units. What is good for the goose is also good for the gander and no one can eat his cake and still have it.\n\nThe die is now cast. Should the campaigners cross the Rubicon of rotation in 2023, there can never be a Southern President again, not to talk of restructuring or a new federal Constitution.\n\nTo avoid the impending doom of slavery, all well-meaning Nigerians \u2013 from gentlemen of the mass media to delegates to party primaries to voters at the polls \u2013 must put pecuniary interests aside and arise to vote wisely to uphold rotation and challenge the Doctrine of Supremacy.\n\nNigeria can only prosper in justice and equity. Otherwise, we had better part ways to exploit our wasting potentials.\n\nChief Emma Nwosu wrote from Lagos",

In a chat with its Deputy Managing Director, Mr Adegbola Adesina, he affirmed that the organisation\u2019s participation was in continuation of a trend that had begun since the commencement of the fair series.\n\n\u2018We are fully ready for the fair. CSS Bookshops Limited has continued to be very active in the story of the fair and this year would not be any different. We are ready and poised to participate and support all of the processes, more so when our own MD is currently serving not only as President of one of the constituent bodies of the umbrella Nigerian Book Fair Trust, the Booksellers Association of Nigeria, but also as Chairman of the Fair Management and Awards Committee, FMAC.\u2019\n\nAsked to shed more light on the specific offerings that industry players and members of the public can expect from CSS at this year\u2019s edition, Adesina said:\n\n\u2018I can point you to our Young Readers and Graded Readers series. We have found them to be quite popular over the years. Many people warm up to them readily on account of the fact that they are affordable, accessible and also cross-cutting in that being general readers trade texts, they are not restricted to specific times and seasons like is the case with say, curriculum books. Also, as representatives of global publishers like McGraw Hill, Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press, we will be showcasing new offerings from our partners. So there is indeed a lot on offer.\n\nEven beyond these, Adesina sees the CSS involvement as most epochal. \u2018You know, we are a heritage organisation. We have been here since 1869 and have over the years come to be established as a one-stop shop in the book\u2019s ecosystem as we run bookselling, publishing and printing operations. We are therefore concerned with our brand; with how the public and our stakeholders see us and respond to our brand, so fairs like this are a great opportunity for us to listen. So we encourage visitors to our stand to come with all the questions that they have for us. We will give them the answers that we have.\u2019",

They had been here earlier and we told them our yearnings. They returned to fulfill their promises. This is an uncommon act in today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nThe monarch however added that the Community is still in a dire need of some other amenities and plead to concerned agencies for intervention.\n\nFurthermore, Mrs. Bolanle Adegunju, the community woman leader and Yeyedofin of Ibala \u00ccj\u1eb9\u0300s\u00e0 appreciated the agencies and the ministries on behalf of women in the community.\n\nShe said the community alone can\u2019t bring the total change needed but the help of the people in positions.\n\nShe subsequently applauded the community teachers for working tirelessly and with dedication as circumstances present.\n\nIn addition, Mrs Funmilayo Ayinla, Osun State Controller of Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment charged parents on responsibility for their wards.\n\nShe said, \u201cchildren are vulnerable beings whose molding solely depend on their parents and elders they see around. We should speak on child labour, though there are many different ways to it but the Osun State Government is committed to bring a stop to it by the year 2025.\u201d\n\nMrs Ayinla afterwards expressed his happiness that the donations were already bearing fruitfulness as there were more pupils who expressed interest to join the school.\n\nOn behalf of the Osun State Ministry of Education, Mrs. Awotunde F.O thanked the International Labour Organization (ILO) on behalf of Osun State Ministry of Education.\n\nShe appealed to the parents to make sure the materials are well taken care of.\n\nFurthermore, speaking on behalf of the state steering committee on child labour, Mrs. Moriyike Pade-Omisakin lamented on the rate by which child labour is surging in communities at alarming rate.\n\nIn her words, the federal and the state governments cannot do it all except with the cooperation of parents and guardians.\n\n\u201cThese materials, though given to you for free, were paid for by some people. Please do take good care of them. We pray may exalted persons emerge from you in the future who would put the community in desired place, \u201d Mrs. Pade-Omisakin admonished.\n\nOlumide Ajani from Osun State Ministry of Women, Child and Social Affairs duly appreciated the community for accommodating representatives from different organizations and ministries.\n\nMr. Ajani reinforced the Ministry\u2019s commitment to prioritize the interest of women and children through its endeavours.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Martin Mary, Chief Executive Officer of Kids and Teams Resource Centre appreciated the community for making the donation feasible.\n\n\u201cSo many hands were on deck in bringing these together. There are representatives from different organizations and ministries here.\n\n\u201cAside from this donations, we will like to counsel you on child abuse, molestation and child labour. It is unlawful and there are punishments for them under the law.\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ministries and the NGOs reaffirmed earlier promise made during consultation with the community leaders to renovate the community school.",

          "text": "An Al Jazeera reporter was shot dead during an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, with Palestinians and the news channel accusing Israel of killing her and Israel\u2019s leader saying she was likely hit by Palestinian fire.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh, 51, a Palestinian-American, was wearing a press vest that clearly marked her as a journalist while reporting in the city of Jenin, the Qatar-based outlet said.\n\nShe was covering the latest arrest operation launched by the Israeli military amid deadly Arab attacks in Israel. The death of a prominent, veteran reporter for the popular news channel seemed likely to add more fuel to a surging conflict.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops came under heavy fire during the Jenin operation. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, in a statement, said \u201cit appears likely that armed Palestinians \u2013 who were firing indiscriminately at the time \u2013 were responsible for the unfortunate death of the journalist.\u201d\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said Abu Akleh had been hit in the head by gunfire. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Al Jazeera described her death as blatant, cold-blooded murder by Israeli forces.\n\n\u201cVery sad to learn of the death of American and Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh,\u201d Tom Nides, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, wrote on Twitter. \u201cI encourage a thorough investigation into the circumstances of her death and the injury of at least one other journalist today in Jenin.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said Israel \u201cwill be conducting a thorough investigation\u201d and it called on the Palestinian Authority to cooperate \u201cto get to the truth\u201d.\n\nBennett said Israel had offered to conduct a joint autopsy and investigation with the PA, whose spokesman rejected the proposal and called for an international inquiry instead.\n\nAli Samoodi, a Palestinian journalist wounded alongside Abu Akleh, said Israeli forces \u201csuddenly opened fire\u201d at them during the operation, and he disputed the military\u2019s account that she had been near Palestinians who had been shooting indiscriminately.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask us to leave and they didn\u2019t ask us to stop (filming). They fired at us. One bullet hit me and another hit Shireen. They killed her in cold blood,\u201d Samoodi, treated at a hospital in Jenin, told Reuters.\n\nA U.S. embassy spokesperson in Jerusalem said Abu Akleh had covered issues in the Middle East and internationally for more than two decades and was \u201cdeeply respected by many Palestinians and others around the world\u201d.\n\nQatar\u2019s deputy foreign minister, on Twitter, said Qatar \u201ccondemns in the strongest terms (the journalist\u2019s) assassination by Israeli occupation forces\u201d.\n\nIn a separate incident on Wednesday, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian during clashes near the West Bank town of Ramallah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. There was no immediate Israeli comment.\n\nVisits by Jewish pilgrims over the past weeks to Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem, Islam\u2019s third holiest site and the most sacred place in Judaism, have stoked Palestinian anger.\n\nSince March, Palestinians and members of Israel\u2019s Arab minority have killed 18 people, including three police officers and a security guard, in attacks in Israel and the West Bank that have mostly targeted civilians.\n\nSome of the assailants have come from Jenin. The city has been a main target of Israeli arrest raids in the West Bank that have often sparked clashes and brought the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or armed civilians since the beginning of the year to at least 42.\n\nThe casualties include armed members of militant groups, lone assailants and bystanders.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Remember that it is about food and nutritional security, the well-being of our farmers, improved income and less use of chemical sprays for environmental sustainability,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the safety of the improved PBR Cowpea, the director-general, National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, assured Nigerians the crop is safe for both human consumption and the environment.\n\nHe stressed that the PBR, genetically-modified with a non-harmful substance sourced from the soil (Bacillus Thuringiensis) that resists insect attacks and infestation of the staple food, was subjected to several rigorous risks analysis and safety tests by the Federal Government before approval for public consumption.\n\nAlso, the country coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology OFAB, Nigeria chapter, Dr. Rose Gidado, said Nigeria has etched her place in the comity of nations with the commercialisation of the PBR Cowpea. Nigeria\u2019s action, she said, has caused other African nations to come learn from her success. She stressed there is no difference between the conventional cowpea and the modified one. \u201cApart from being resistant to insects, they share the same characteristics in taste, colour, texture etc.\u201d",

That is why it has been at the core of this administration. The results are there for all to see. Boko Haram have been forced back from controlling whole swathes of this country.

This, he claims, is necessary to create a new constitution for the people, made possible, paradoxically, by ignoring their democratic rights.

          "text": "The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo state Taiwo Adisa has slammed Senator Teslim Folarin, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the opposition All Progressives Congress in the state, for claiming that none of the opposition party\u2019s gubernatorial aspirants is as worse as Makinde.\n\nAdisa, in a statement in response to Folarin\u2019s attack on Governor Makinde, said that the Senator \u201cdished out lies about Makinde\u201d while declaring his governorship ambition at the APC Secretariat in Ibadan.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide, who wondered why Folarin turned an event designed for him to declare his 2023 governorship ambition into a fiesta of lies, said the Oyo State electorate would not fall for the lies of APC chieftains, including Folarin, against Governor Makinde.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide declared that it was laughable that despite the massive infrastructure development, improvement in the education and health sectors and other efforts of the Makinde government in the last three years, Folarin could still say he was coming to rescue Oyo State \u201cbecause every tangible project in the state was done by the previous government.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adisa, rather than Folarin articulating details of his in comparison to Makinde\u2019s globally acclaimed Roadmap to Accelerated Development of Oyo State, 2019-2023, he only marshaled a couple of lies, which insulted the sensibilities of Oyo State residents across the five zones of the state, who have continued to laud Governor Makinde for good governance in the state.\n\nAdisa, commended Folarin for telling residents of Oyo State what they already suspect; that governorship aspirants in APC were bad products, as according to him [Adisa], there is no basis to compare Makinde with any of them.\n\nAdisa said: \u201cWe have read with amusement words credited to an Oyo APC governorship aspirant, Senator Teslim Folarin, that he is coming to rescue Oyo State and that none of the aspirants in the ill-fated APC, Oyo State chapter is as bad as Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we must commend Folarin for letting the Oyo State public know that governorship aspirants in APC are bad products. However, there is no basis to compare any of the APC governorship aspirants with Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cNobody can compare light with darkness. In three years, Makinde has done what the APC government failed to do in eight years; building over 500 kilometres of road, putting in place a free and qualitative education system, improving the health and security sector and all that.\n\n\u201cSenator Folarin was also credited to have said that all tangible projects in the state were done by the previous government. This is an outright lie and we are sure that the people of Oyo State do not need such a lie. The people will not fall for cheap lies and deceit.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to ask whether it was the previous APC government that built the 65 km Moniya-Iseyin road, the 45km Saki-Ogbooro-Igboho Road, the 12km Awotan- Akufo concrete road, the 38km Oyo-Iseyin road and the 76 km Ogbomoso-Iseyin road, which are at various stages of completion as we speak.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people will also ask whether it was the failed APC administration of 2011 to 2019 that built the magnificent Bus Terminals at Ojoo and Challenge as well the Terminals at Iwo Road and Old Ife Road, which are nearing completion.\n\n\u201cIt can be seen that Folarin has not been in touch with the reality in Oyo State, he thus needs to connect with Oyo State people and his followers, who could tell him the state of things regarding infrastructure development under the Makinde government.\n\n\u201cHe needs to at least be conversant with his local government, Ona-Ara, where massive developments are ongoing. He needs to be told that in his Ona-Ara Local Govt of origin, the Makinde government is building the 37-kilometre Akanran-Olorunsogo-Dagbolu and 21 Ajia-Airport Road with spur to Amuloko and the two will be commissioned shortly.\n\n\u201cIn order to end his apparent lack of information or is it denial of reality, we will volunteer to take the senator on a tour of tangible projects across the state, from Moniya-Iseyin Road, to Asipa-Sabo-Gedu-Oroki Road to the Saki Township Road, and also visit ongoing road projects in Oyo-Iseyin and the 76-kilometre Iseyin-Ogbomoso roads and end the trip in Ona-Ara.\u201d\n\nAdisa warned Folarin to stop his unnecessary obsession with attacking Makinde, urging him to focus on how to convince his partymen in the APC to accept him as candidate despite his undemocratic credentials.\n\n\u201cWe urge Folarin to focus his energy on convincing those he met in APC, when he defected from PDP which he ruined with his undemocratic tendencies, rather than inciting the people and engaging in baseless conspiracies against a government that is delivering good governance,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "The United States warned on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ready for a long war in Ukraine and will not stop at the eastern Donbas region where fighting is currently raging.\n\nWashington\u2019s bleak prediction came as Ukraine said its membership of the European Union was a question of \u201cwar and peace\u201d for the whole continent as it faces up to Moscow.\n\nAs it battled Russian attempts to advance in the east, Kyiv hailed what it said was EU powerhouse Germany\u2019s change of stance on a Russian oil embargo and on supplying arms to Ukraine.\n\nViolence still raged in southern Ukraine with overnight missile strikes in the port of Odessa, while officials said some 1,000 troops were trapped in the Azovstal steel works in the devastated city of Mariupol.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on February 24 but Ukrainian forces managed to push Moscow\u2019s forces back from Kyiv, and the conflict is now well into its third month.\n\nPutin gave few hints on his plans in a speech during a huge military parade in Moscow on Monday, saying only that Russian troops were defending the \u201cMotherland\u201d and blaming the West for the conflict.\n\nBut US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Tuesday that Putin will not end the war with the Donbas campaign and is determined to build a land bridge to Russian-controlled territory in Moldova.\n\nUS intelligence also views it as increasingly likely that Putin will mobilise his entire country, including ordering martial law, and is counting on his perseverance to wear down Western support for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas,\u201d Haines said.\n\n\u2018Counting the bombs\u2019\n\nMoscow switched its focus to Russian-speaking Donbas, where separatists have been fighting since 2014, after failing to take Kyiv.\n\nUkraine\u2019s presidency said the \u201cepicentre of the fighting has moved\u201d to Bilogorivka in the Lugansk region, the site of a deadly Russian air strike on a school on Sunday that Ukrainian officials said killed 60 people.\n\nShelling also continued in Ukraine\u2019s easternmost strongholds, the sister cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, it said. An AFP team had seen columns of Ukrainian trucks moving away from Severodonetsk on Monday.\n\nCivilians were struggling to survive between the constantly shifting front lines.\n\n\u201cI feel total apathy. I am morally starved \u2014 not to mention physically,\u201d said bricklayer Artyom Cherukha, 41, as he collected water trickling from a natural spring in Lysychansk.\n\nHe was trying to get supplies for his family of nine, as people in the areas steadily lose access to water and food.\n\n\u201cWe sit here counting the bombs,\u201d said Cherukha.\n\nIn the south, a series of missile strikes in Odessa overnight meanwhile destroyed buildings, set ablaze a shopping centre and killed one person, just hours after a visit by European Council President Charles Michel.\n\nMichel had earlier warned that vital supplies of wheat and grain that were ready for export from Ukraine, one of the world\u2019s key producers, were stuck in Odessa because of the conflict.\n\nGermany \u2018changed position\u2019\n\nUkraine has been pushing Western countries for more support, and has been particularly critical of Germany for its slow response and unwillingness to give up Russian energy.\n\nBut the tone changed on Tuesday when German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock\u2019s surprise visit to Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops have been accused of war crimes.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank Germany for changing its position on a number of issues,\u201d Dmytro Kuleba told a press conference in Kyiv with Baerbock.\n\n\u201cGermany has changed its position on arms supplies to Ukraine,\u201d said Kuleba, adding that Kyiv was also \u201cgrateful to Germany for supporting the introduction of the oil embargo\u201d by the EU.\n\nThe Ukrainian top diplomat however pushed for the European Union to admit his country, after French President Emmanuel Macron said it could take decades for Ukraine to join.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasise that Ukraine\u2019s membership in the EU is a matter of war and peace in Europe,\u201d said Kuleba. \u201cOne of the reasons that this war started is that Putin was convinced that Europe doesn\u2019t need Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe German was accompanied by her Dutch counterpart Wopke Hoekstra, whose country reopened its embassy in Kyiv.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has meanwhile resurrected a World War II measure to aid Kyiv, opening the spigots on artillery, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank weapons and other powerful Western materiel.\n\nUS lawmakers were set to begin debate on Tuesday on a nearly $40 billion aid package, which is expected to pass comfortably with rare bipartisan support.\n\n\u2018Urgent evacuation\u2019\n\nMoscow has made more progress in southern Ukraine but \u201cmore than a thousand\u201d Ukrainian soldiers remain in the Azovstal steel works in the port of Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, told AFP.\n\nThe plant is the final bastion of Ukrainian resistance in the city, which has seen relentless destruction since Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s February 24 invasion.\n\n\u201cHundreds are injured. There are people with serious injuries who require urgent evacuation. The situation is deteriorating every day,\u201d said Vereshchuk.\n\nMany civilians have been evacuated from the plant in recent days, as Russia pushes for full control of Mariupol to open up a land corridor from Crimea, which it seized in 2014.\n\nRussia faces mounting international outrage, and is already under tough sanctions.\n\nMoscow said it would not participate in Thursday\u2019s special session of the UN Human Rights Council on Ukraine.\n\nThe Council announced on Monday that it would hold a special session at Kyiv\u2019s request to examine \u201cthe deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression\u201d.\n\nIn another step forward in building pressure on Russia, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she made \u201cprogress\u201d on a proposed Russian oil embargo during talks with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nThe populist Orban is one of Putin\u2019s closest friends in Europe and had held up the bloc\u2019s attempt to phase out Russian oil \u2014 one of the most painful measures yet taken by the West \u2014 as he pointed to economic consequences in landlocked Hungary.\n\nWestern powers on Tuesday separately accused Russian authorities of carrying out a cyberattack against a satellite network an hour before the invasion of Ukraine to pave the way for its assault.",

As it is now, the electoral process has started, so why do they want to change the rules when the processes have already started?. But the most important issue here is that last time they reached an agreement on this matter, the National Assembly did not live up to its own commitment to the president,\u201d a political analyst who pleaded anonymity said.\n\nHe further pointed out that the president has 30 days to either sign or withhold assent, by then all the primaries would have been done. So of what purpose is the rushed amendment?\n\nThe decision at the Red Chamber followed the expeditious consideration of a bill during plenary which scaled first, second and third readings, respectively, and was passed during plenary by the chamber after consideration by the Committee of the Whole.\n\nThose identified as \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 include the President, Vice President, Members of the National Assembly, Governors and their deputies, Members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Councils, Councillors, National Working Committee of political parties, amongst others.\n\nThe bill to amend the 2022 Electoral Act No. 13 was sponsored by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege (Delta Central).\n\nOmo-Agege, in his presentation, said the bill seeks to amend the provision of section 84(8) of the Electoral Act.\n\nAccording to him, the provisions of the section \u201cdoes not provide for the participation of what is generally known as \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe extant section only clearly provides for the participation of elected delegates in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties held to nominate candidates of political parties.\n\n\u201cThis is an unintended error, and we can only correct it with this amendment now before us,\u201d the Deputy Senate President said.\n\nSpeaking after the bill to amend the 2022 Electoral Act was passed, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, said the amendment became imperative in view of the deficiency created by the provision of section 84(8) of the extant Act.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe amended Electoral Act of 2022 that we passed this year, has a deficiency that was never intended and that deficiency will deny all statutory delegates in all political parties from participation in congresses and conventions.\n\n\u201cAnd, therefore, such a major and unintended clause has to be amended before the party primaries starts in the next eight days. This is an emergency legislation, so to speak.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that the National Assembly \u2013 the two chambers \u2013 would finish with the processing of this amendment of this bill, between today (in the Senate) and tomorrow (in the House of Representatives), and then the Executive will do the assent.\n\n\u201cThat is so important to enable every statutory delegate to participate in the party primaries right from the beginning that will start on the 18th of May, 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this is an emergency effort to ensure that nobody is denied his or her rightful opportunity as a delegate, especially the statutory delegates, and these are those who are elected.\n\n\u201cThese are the president, vice president, members of the National Assembly, governors, members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Council and their Councillors, National Working Committee Members of all the political parties and so on.\n\n\u201cThis is a fundamental effort to ensure that we address this within the week, so that by next week, the Electoral Act, 2022 (amended version), will be very salutary for us to start our party primaries.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the House of Representatives would today hold an emergency plenary session on the matter.\n\nThe lawmakers had on May 4, adjourned plenary to May 24, to enable the lawmakers seeking reelection to take part in their primaries scheduled for May 22.\n\nIn a circular issued by the Clerk of the House, Dr. Yahaya Danzaria, he said the session became necessary to amend a fundamental error in the Act.\n\nThe circular read: \u201cThis is to inform all Hon. Members, staff, media and the general public that the House hereby reconvenes for an emergency plenary session against tomorrow, Wednesday, 11th May, 2022 at 11:00am.\n\n\u201cThis session has become necessary especially as to amend a fundamental error in the Electoral Act. The House regrets this short notice and implores all Members to be present.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s Senate on Tuesday amended the Electoral Act, 2022, to allow \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 \u2013 all those elected \u2013 to participate and vote in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties.\nThe bill to amend the 2022 Electoral Act No.\nOmo-Agege, in his presentation, said the bill seeks to amend the provision of section 84(8) of the Electoral Act.\n\u201cThese are the president, vice president, members of the National Assembly, governors, members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Council and their Councillors, National Working Committee Members of all the political parties and so on.\n\u201cThis session has become necessary especially as to amend a fundamental error in the Electoral Act.",

          "text": "JP Morgan, an American multinational investment bank has removed Nigeria from its list of emerging market sovereign recommendations that investors should be \u2018overweight\u2019 in, saying the country had not taken advantage of high oil prices.\n\nIt however, added Serbia and Uzbekistan to the list.\n\nAccording to Reuters, JP Morgan\u2019s analysts noted that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) did not transfer any revenue to the government from January to March this year, due to petrol subsidies and low oil production, which was the reason it moved Nigeria\u2019s debt out of its \u2018overweight\u2019 category.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s fiscal woes amid a worsening global risk backdrop have raised market concerns despite a positive oil environment,\u201d they said.\n\nIn Nigeria, its Senate last month approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nHowever, JP Morgan moved Serbia to \u2018overweight\u2019 stating that risks had been priced in and the country had high reserves and a fiscally cautious government, while relatively low debt despite Russian exposure led them to put Uzbekistan in the same category.\n\nIn addition, Reuters quoted analysts at the bank to have estimated that emerging market sovereign debt was at the \u201cmercy\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decisions, as the United States central bank\u2019s rate raises drain capital from developing markets.\n\nLast week, the Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point, the biggest jump in 22 years, as it seeks to tame high inflation while its rate increases also buffet higher-yielding emerging markets.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified (EMBIGD) index has fallen 16 per cent this year, the analysts said, \u201cwith most of the losses having come from rates\u201d and $4 billion in net outflows from emerging markets since mid-April.\n\n\u201cThe external and fundamental backdrop has become increasingly difficult for EM sovereigns,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe COVID lockdown in China poses further downside risks.\u201d\n\nThey noted that riskier sovereign yields were now 10.6 per cent, the highest level since the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, reducing market access and increasing the risk of debt defaults.\n\nHowever, the analysts said the \u201cfront-loaded pain\u201d for emerging market bonds, which they said had begun underperforming in September 2021, was a positive.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February caused commodity prices to spike, benefiting exporters. The over-performance of bonds issued by oil exporters now \u201clooks to have played out\u201d, JPMorgan said.",
