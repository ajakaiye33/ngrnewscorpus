          "title": "Senate re-amends electoral bill to define mode of primaries",
          "text": "The Senate on Tuesday re-amended the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, 2022, for a second time, to include provisions that clearly define the mode of primaries for political parties.\n\nThe re-amendment was sequel to a motion on \u201crescission on clause 84 of the Electoral Act No. 26 2010 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and Committal to the Committee of the Whole.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Senate President on Media, Ezrel Tabiowo, the motion was sponsored by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, after the amendment to the electoral bill by the Committee of the Whole, said the re-amendment was done to harmonise its position with that of the House of Representatives.\n\nLawan added that amendment accommodates clearly define provisions for the mode of primaries.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the bill would be signed into law when transmitted by the National Assembly to the President for his assent.\n\nHe warned that political parties that fail or refuse to abide by the provisions on the mode of primaries, would miss out on the opportunity to participate during elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the mode of conducting primaries by parties to produce candidates, we have concluded our task on the amendment to the Electoral Act No. 6 2010 Bill.\n\n\u201cYou would recall that the Senate and the House passed the Electoral Act amendment Bill with slight difference.\n\n\u201cWhile the House passed the mode of primaries to be direct and indirect only, the Senate passed the mode of primaries to be direct, indirect and consensus.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done is to give very clear and sufficient definition to each mode of primaries.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary is well defined on how it will be conducted; ditto the Indirect primaries. And for the consensus, the two chambers have produced in this Bill, a very clear definition of how a consensus candidate would emerge.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are very glad that we have been able to achieve this consensus between the two chambers to arrive at this harmonised version, and we are also very optimistic that Mr President will sign the bill.\n\n\u201cOur desire is to ensure that we reform the electoral processes in Nigeria for better transparency, accountability and Integrity to the satisfaction of Nigerians and the international community.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties, when this is signed into law, will have the responsibility of ensuring that they follow the law, otherwise they will end up missing the opportunity to participate in elections.\u201d\n\nThe amended bill provides in clause 84 (2) that, \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or consensus.\u201d\n\nIt added in 84(3) that \u201ca political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election in its constitution, guidelines, or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nOn Direct Primaries in 84 (4), the amended version provides that, \u201cA political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of Presidential Primaries, all registered members of the party shall vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the Federation.\n\n\u201c(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) above of this subsection shall be adopted for direct primaries in respect of Gubernatorial, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies.\n\n\u201c(c) Special Conventions or Congresses shall be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centres at the National, State, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nOn Indirect Primaries, the bill provides under 84(5) that, \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, the political party shall \u2013 (i) hold a Special Presidential Convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the Federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party where delegates shall vote for aspirants of their choice.\n\n\u201c(ii) the aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the Presidential primaries of the political party and that aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIt further provides under 84(7) that, \u201cWhere there is only one aspirant or a consensus candidate in a political party for any of the elective positions mentioned in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) and (d), the party shall convene a special convention or congress at a designated Centre on a specified date for the confirmation of such aspirant and the name of the aspirant shall be forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Bill provides in 84(8) that, \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rule the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress meeting.\u201d\n\nOn Consensus Candidate the bill in 84(9)(a) provides, \u201cA political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nIt goes further in paragraph (b) that, \u201cWhere a political party is unable to secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective positions.\u201d\n\nThe bill states in paragraph (c) that, \u201cA Special Convention or nomination Congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centres at the National, State, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "4m MSMEs benefit from FG\u2019s N150bn funding \u2014 Osinbajo",
          "text": "Professor Yemi Osinbajo\n\nBy Emma Ujah\n\nMore than four million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises have benefitted from various schemes of the Federal Government, amounting N150 billion, targeted at uplifting the sub-sector in the country.\n\nMr. Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, in a statement, said beyond providing interest-free microcredit loans to petty traders, the various social intervention schemes of the Buhari administration have made significant impact in the lives of millions of ordinary Nigerians.\n\nHe quoted Professor Osinbajo, as saying: \u201cThis is a shining case study of what President Muhammadu Buhari strongly believes: that Nigerians will solve Nigeria\u2019s problems. This is an example of what we can achieve when we unleash the best of our people \u2013 especially our young \u2013 on the toughest of our challenges, and give them the free-hand to deliver results.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo spoke at the launch of a Bank of Industry Business Growth Platform, yesterday.\n\nThe BOI Growth Platform includes interventions schemes such as the renowned Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) loans (MarketMoni, FarmerMoni and TraderMoni) \u2013 regarded as Africa\u2019s largest fully-digitized micro-credit scheme, the MSME Survival Fund under the Economic Sustanaibility Plan (ESP), the North-East Rehabilitation Fund, the recently launched World Bank $750million NG-CARES programme, and state-based interventions, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis demographic was far too important to ignore. We had to start solving for them, especially having been left far behind historically,\u201d a reason he noted led to the implementation of intervention schemes through the BOI\u2019s Growth Platform for MSMEs.\n\n\u201cWhat might also not be obvious is the sheer scale of impact that has been achieved with these programmes, as over four million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises have been direct beneficiaries of the over N150billion deployed in the past five years.\n\n\u201c57 percent of these MSMEs are owned by Nigerians below 35 years of age, and close to 60 percent of the beneficiaries are women. What is even less glaring is that the team of Nigerian professionals behind this work is largely young, with an average age of 28 years old.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the transparency and impact of these microcredit schemes, particularly the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP loans \u2013 MarketMoni, FarmerMoni and TraderMoni) under the SIPs, Prof. Osinbajo recalled his interaction in 2018 with a petty trader, Jafar Abubakar, one of the Tradermoni beneficiaries at Abubakar Gumi Market in Kaduna when he visited to launch the scheme in the State.\n\nHe narrated: \u201cJafar Abubakar, who trades in ginger and garlic was one of 5,000 or so traders who had just received N10,000 to advance his business in that market. What struck me was what he said about how he was selected to get the credit.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018I just applied. I didn\u2019t know anybody. They came here and captured my data last week and I got the alert yesterday.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe VP added that Jafar then \u201cshowed me the alert on his phone. Stories like Jafar\u2019s have become all too familiar to me over these years. It is a consistent tune I hear as I engage thousands of beneficiaries of our intervention programmes.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the TraderMoni scheme, which provides N10,000 interest-free & collateral free loans to petty traders, mostly with an inventory of less than N5,000, had made huge positive impact nationwide. This includes enhancing the small businesses of beneficiaries, improving their families and contributing to the informal economy.\n\n\u201cThis is perhaps for me one of the most satisfying things about the way our social intervention schemes are deployed. That there is a platform that can process applications from potential beneficiaries, pay out credits or other benefits, maintain auditable records seamlessly. It is those people and infrastructure that make this happen that we are celebrating today,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo noted.\n\nOsinbajo further highlighted the nationwide impact of the Administration\u2019s Social Investment Programmes, which he noted was the \u201cmost ambitious social intervention project in Nigeria\u2019s recent history, with a series of people-centric programmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a journey that only began as an idea six years ago: that we can build systems that will serve everybody fairly and justly and bring credibility to government programmes. One of the biggest barriers we identified was the ability to reach people directly, capture and digitize their information (even if they are illiterate) and process a benefit to them directly in a way that is transparent to all. Our vision set out to solve this.\n\n\u201cFor some programmes, the everyday Nigerians were young graduates who would benefit from a direct stipend and employment placement from the government. For others, it would be pupils for whom a reliable meal per day would make the difference between staying enrolled in school or skipping school to earn money for that meal.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo also praised the infrastructure and transparency behind the BOI Growth Platform schemes. For instance, he recalled his visit to the Growth Platform\u2019s Command Centre, which now has \u201c22,000 agents, living across all LGAs in Nigeria and equipped with its proprietary mobile technologies, receive mandates to capture and digitize businesses eligible for its growing suite of programmes.\n\n\u201cEvery detail of each business is trackable centrally at the Bank of Industry, down to biodata, geolocation, images and facial IDs of every micro, small and medium entrepreneur where applicable. This has greatly simplified the profiling and decision-making processes that have allowed for direct outreach and impact on Nigerian MSMEs at tremendous scale. And this is being done with entirely home-grown solutions and an ecosystem of institutions, donor partners, service providers and technology companies in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also commended the Managing Director of the Bank of Industry, Mr. Olukayode Pitan; as well as the BOI Growth Platform team led by its Executive Director, BOI, Toyin Adeniji; with Uzoma Nwagba as its Chief Operating Officer.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cthey have brought to bear the best of experience and bold thinking, the depths of innovation and youth, and a detailed understanding of the Nigerian spirit, to build an operation and impact that have become a national pride. The over four million micro, small and medium enterprises impacted till date, and the several more to come, are a direct testament to their hard work.\u201d\n\nAdeniji and Nwagba are the co-authors of the \u201cAid for Productivity\u201d report, which they formally presented at the launch.\n\nThe VP also applauded pioneering partners, particularly the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for providing the much-needed early support to the Bank of Industry to build this operation to the large scale it is now.\n\nIn his remarks, the BOI Managing Director, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, restated the impact of its programmes, noting how programmes such as GEEP have won several local and international awards, including the award at the 2019 African Bankers\u2019 Awards as the most impactful Financial Inclusion program in Africa.\n\nThe event also featured closing remarks by representatives of BOI partners: including Mr. Ahmed Rostom, Senior Financial Sector Specialist, World Bank; and the country director, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, Dr Jeremie Zoungrana.\n\nProf. Osinbajo also commended the commitment of Nigerian financial institutions, technology companies, service providers and programme partners who he said \u201chave given the best of their expertise to this work over the years.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Chief Executive Officer of Stanel Group, Dr. Stanley Uzochukwu has admonished matriculating students of the Igbinedion University, Okada to follow the part of creativity and innovations through hard work.\n\nSharing personal testimonies and experiences with the students, Uzochukwu asserted that \u201cwhen you solve problems, money follows services\u201d.\n\nRecall that Dr. Stanley Uzochukwu was in June 2021 appointed the youngest Board Member of the Igbinedion University.\n\nUzochukwu gave the charge on the occasion of the 23rd matriculation ceremony at the University Campus, Okada where he was assigned to deliver a matriculation lecture on, \u201cAscending Greater Heights Through Entrepreneurship, Innovations And Creativity\u201d.\n\nThe young employer of labour started sharing the mind-blowing testimonies and life experiences with the matriculating students by thanking the Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Lawrence Ikechukwu Ezenmonye for the rare privilege given him to speak as the Guest Speaker of the ceremony.\n\nIn his words, \u201cThank you very much, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Lawrence Ikechukwu Ezenmonye for this great privilege.\n\n\u201cI would like to congratulate the matriculating students. Congratulations, to you all for making it to this great citadel of learning.\n\n\u201cLike I said to the VC, I have not come to give a speech but to share experiences and to tell stories that you will learn lessons from the stories because examples are shared so that principles can learn.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I like to congratulate the matriculating students once again.\n\n\u201cVC, please permit me to share a testimony that I almost shared with you in your house but I have not shared the testimony on any platform before.\n\n\u201cI congratulated the matriculating students twice because when I got out of school, my biggest goal was to get admission into Igbinedion University.\n\n\u201cSadly, that didn\u2019t happen because my parents couldn\u2019t afford the fees and, sadly, I found myself in the University of Jos. However, much later, VC, my younger brother, the last child, when I started a business and was doing well, we were able to send him to Igbinedion University.\n\n\u201cWhen I got a call from an elder statesman in this country, he said to me, Stanley, where are you? Come and see me. When I got there he said he wanted me to meet with his Excellency, Chief Lucky Igbinedion. When I met the former Edo State Governor, he said to me; will your time permit you to serve on the Board of Igbinedion University? I looked at him but he didn\u2019t know why I was looking at him. I went flat on the floor thanking him for the great privilege. He didn\u2019t understand till today why I went flat on the floor.\n\n\u201cI could not afford to pay the fees to attend the Igbinedion University but, to the glory of God, I am on the Board of the University today. I believe that should challenge someone. Story No.1; I like to let you know that there is nothing God cannot do.\n\n\u201cI am to speak on Ascending Greater Heights Through Entrepreneurship, Innovations And Creativity. When the topic was sent to me, I said to the VC, ascending greater heights through entrepreneurship alone is a broad topic of its own. I am sure, everyone here wants to grow.\n\n\u201cI am going to share some secrets and some life principles that I have followed and by the mercies of God has helped us grow.\n\n\u201cGrowth is enhanced structure. I will like to you know that if you jump up, you will definitely come down. But when you climb up from the ground, you will sail up. One lesson to learn from that is patience. There is absolutely nothing like accidental success.\n\n\u201cMy mentor, Dr. Cusmos Maduka always says that money always goes at go. There is a difference between getting and making. Whatever you make, stays but whatever you get, many atimes goes.\n\n\u201cKeys that will help us attain greater heights: One key that has always helped me is association. I never have my mates as my friend. I always move closer to those that are ahead of me.\n\nLet me share this story with the matriculating students. When I was admitted into the University of Jos, I had a senior student who walked up to me and was approaching me to join a cult. He said to me,\n\n\u201cThis is what will make you a big boy in school\u201d. But I avoided him and instead joined a fellowship in the University. The same student pressurised me until we got into our 300L and then graduated.\n\n\u201cWhen we started our location in Anambra, I was coming out of a hotel and I saw the same man running to me and said; \u201cDo you remember me\u201d? I looked at him but couldn\u2019t remember him and he then reminded me who he was. I remembered that he was the young man pressurizing me to join a cult in the University.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking hearing what he was saying to me. He said, \u201cI heard you are the owner of that new facility coming up in Anambra. Please, can you employ me?\n\n\u201cI unconsciously gave him my number and he started disturbing me with calls but I never picked.\n\n\u201cWhat is the lesson for young matriculating students today? The small boys and the small girls in the University later become the big boys and girls tomorrow. And the big boys and big girls in school become nobody when school is over. This is one proven truth I do not want you to forget even if you are to forget anything. What made them big boys and girls then, was joining different cults and doing all sorts of things while others were reading. The big boys and girls then were wearing designer shoes, designer wristwatches but the small boys and girls had none than to read their books. But they will later become the biggest boys and girls after school.\n\n\u201cI will tell you this other story of when I came into Abuja the first time. One of my uncles introduced me to a businessman who deals in biometric briefcases and as an entrepreneurial-minded person, I decided to pick some of the briefcases to come and introduce them to the parents of my friends who were rich to afford it.\n\n\u201cOne of my experiences with these children of the rich who were to introduce me to their parents was not funny. There was a day one of them was to introduce me to his father and they were four in number in a car fully wind up and four of them were smoking Indian hemp. I was invited to join them to have a taste of the Indian Hemp but I refused though I was inhaling the smoke in their midst.\n\n\u201cI stood my ground not to join them in smoking because I was focused. My focus was to sell the briefcases.\n\n\u201cBut may I tell you the story of those four guys today? One of them is dead as I speak. Two of them are at the rehabilitation centre while the fourth one is a mad man on the street of Enugu today.\n\n\u201cThe rhetorical question is, what would have been my own fate today if I had joined them? Only God knows! The great lesson to learn from the story is that it is important you remain sensitive and focused. Know at every point in time why you are here at the University for.\n\n\u201cThere are friends that will also talk you down, but in all remain, focused on your study.\n\n\u201cComing into the University, I told the VC and I will tell you also that when you approach life casually, you end up a casualty. Those of you that are privileged to enter into this University, be very focused. Don\u2019t approach this opportunity casually.\n\n\u201cI like to let you know that the only way up is to start from down. No tree goes up without growing from the root.\n\n\u201cI will like to share this testimony with you. We were privileged to buy a franchise of Chicken Republic five years ago. I stooped low in disguise to go and work in a Chicken Republic store in Lagos for three months.\n\n\u201cI would take off my wristwatch, parked my car somewhere and jump across the road to the store. We were asked to work in the backyard first because we have to first learn the cooking skills and all of that in the kitchen.\n\nAt another point, they said the new intakes/trainees have to wash the toilets. I was with one of my GMs then. She looked at me and I looked at her and said, let\u2019s go. We washed the toilets. They were using us as slaves. When it was time for the cooking, we started learning.\n\n\u201cNow as you see me standing here, I can prepare all the meals. When I was done with the backyard training, I started working at the cashier serving customers.\n\n\u201cThe lady that was teaching me how to cook then started falling in love with me until one day she googled my name (I didn\u2019t know how it all happened) and discovered my true identity. When she ran to me to tell me about myself, I quietly came out and escaped. That was the last day, I went to that place.\n\n\u201cToday, it is helping me. I can sit down in my house now and go through the report and I will know if one meat pie is stolen or not. Sitting in my room when a report is sent to me, I go through it, if you eat one spoon of my rice, I know. Why? It\u2019s because I went down to learn.\n\n\u201cToday, to the glory of God, we have started our own eatery brand that can give a huge competition to any other eatery brand in this country. We get there by going down.\n\n\u201cGod blesses man through man. What you need is in another man\u2019s hand. I have had a lot of people asking me, saying, how do you maintain relationships with older people? They said because they have tried it but little time the older people would stop picking up their calls. There are set principles! One major thing that would help you keep and maintain relationships with older people is humility. Humility is a door opener. There are cultures that are dying these days among young people. I stayed with older people so I learnt their character.\n\n\u201cThe culture of honour is another principle which has helped me. I always tell young people that when you are going before a King or anyone you look up to, never go empty-handed. There is this saying in Ibo land that you don\u2019t pour a cup of water into an ocean. That\u2019s a useless statement! When you meet a man that is where you want to be, you sow to connect with the oil that he carries. It is something that has worked for me. It has brought me from where I used to be to where I am today.\n\n\u201cThe culture of begging. There was a young man who had shared a brilliant business idea with a Minister but all of a sudden, the Minister stopped taking his calls and I asked him what had gone wrong. He said he sent him a text message attached with his account number asking the Minister to assist him in payment of his child\u2019s school fees. That was the end of the business idea that had been conceived with the man.\n\n\u201cWhen you meet people, be value-oriented. Add value to yourself. One day I call Dr Cusmos Maduka and said, Sir, are you very busy, there is something I would like to discuss with you and he said, Stanley, go ahead. I am always busy but whenever your call comes, I know it\u2019s an important call, so I always have to pick it.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot to talk about but for want of time, let me quickly and briefly talk about entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cWhen you solve problems, money follows service. The difference between the Nokia phone of yesterday and the iPhone of today is creativity and innovation.\n\n\u201cSome people say, \u201cThink outside the box\u201d but I say to you, \u201cThink without a box.\u201d Do something new and extraordinarily. Today\u2019s excellence is tomorrow\u2019s mediocrity. You have to keep evolving. Change is a constant thing. Imagine life today without money transfer innovation. You have to go to the bank to make the smallest transfer. Imagine lives today without service deliveries. Imagine life today without a telephone. The guys that brought about all these innovations out of their own creativity have all gone up. They are on top today on the premises of innovation.\u201d",

Could it be that the gate is being made available for smugglers?\n\nFAAN defended its tweet, saying the restricted areas at the airport are in the interest of national security, adding that no staff or agency is beyond standard security procedures.\n\n\u201cIt is a cargo terminal in Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA is not a dedicated International Cargo Airport. In the interest of National security, All airfields worldwide are Security Restricted Areas (SRA), be it cargo or non-cargo airports.\n\n\u201cNo staff or agency is beyond or above submitting to standard security procedures in any airport, no matter what role the agency plays. No role justifies serial indiscipline and assault on fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cWe must not trivialize this matter as about FAAN or the Customs; it\u2019s about the Dignity and safety of our security personnel who are regularly assaulted and humiliated in public,\u201d FAAN wrote.",

Bypassing the amendment to 84, the mode of conducting primaries by parties to produce candidates, we have concluded on our task on the amendment to the Electoral Act No. 6, 2010 Bill.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that the Senate and the House passed the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill with slight difference.\n\n\u201cWhile the House passed the mode of primaries to be direct and indirect only, the Senate a passed the mode of primaries to be direct, indirect and consensus.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done is to give very clear and sufficient definition to each mode of primaries.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary is well defined and how it will be conducted. Ditto the indirect primaries. And for the consensus, the two Chambers have produced in this bill, very clear definition of how the consensus candidate would emerge.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are very glad that we have been able to achieve this consensus between the two chambers to arrive at this harmonised version and we are also very optimistic that Mr. President will sign the Bill.\n\n\u201cOur desire is to ensure that we reform the electoral processes in Nigeria for better transparency, accountability and integrity to the satisfaction of Nigerians and the international community.\n\n\u201cWhen this is signed into law, political parties would have the responsibility of ensuring that they follow the law.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, they will end up missing the opportunity to participate in elections.\u201d",

          "text": "A new corruption perception index (CPI) released by Transparency International has ranked Nigeria 154 of 180 countries sampled methodically.\n\nThe organisation, in its latest report released on Tuesday in Abuja, said that Nigeria dropped five places downward compared to the 2020 CPI results.\n\nThe report showed that Nigeria scored 24 out of 100 points in the 2021 CPI, falling back one point compared to the 2020 CPI.\n\nCountry Representative of TI, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani blamed the decline on corruption in the public sector.\n\nTransparency International has released the 2021 corruption perception index globally, placing Nigeria 154 out of 180 countries studied methodologically.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRafsanjani, who is also the Executive Director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), said that corruption in Nigeria has greatly contributed to the nation\u2019s underdevelopment.\n\nThe TI rep noted despite successive governments claiming to fight corruption, job opportunities, driving license acquisition, passport applications among others, were still frost with corrupt tendencies, especially as officials in charge of these basic services expect some form of kickbacks while rendering such duties.\n\nHe claimed that corruption was responsible for rising insecurity, high unemployment rate and systemic failure in healthcare delivery and leadership dysfunctions.\n\nThe TI Rep said: \u201cThe CPI aggregates data from eight different sources that provide perceptions by country experts and business people on the level of corruption in the public sector.\n\n\u201cWhile the index does not show specific incidences of corruption in the country, it indicates the perception of corruption in Nigeria. The index is completely impartial, objective and globally acknowledged as the most widely used cross country parameter for measuring corruption.\n\n\u201cThis shows that corruption is still a major challenge in our country, hindering development. It has upturned our value system negatively. It has affected good governance in this country; that is why we are concerned as Nigerians.\n\n\u201cCorruption is destroying our country.

          "text": "Since the 2021-22 Premier League season commenced on August 13, 2021, eight clubs have sacked their managers.\n\nWatford sacked two managers within the space of three months in what appears to be the management running of patience over the inability of the managers to deliver in the season whose final match round will take place on May 22, 2022.\n\nManchester City are the defending champions, having won their fifth Premier League title during the previous season.\n\nThe current season saw the return of full attendance after the final third of the 2019\u201320 and the entirety of the 2020\u201321 seasons were held with limited or no attendance due to the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHere are the eight Premier League managers sacked in 2021-22:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u2022Xisco Munoz\n\nWatford sacked Xisco Munoz, the first manager of the campaign to lose his job in England, on October 3, 2021. He was succeeded by Claudio Ranieri.\n\nMunoz led the club to promotion from the Championship in 2020-21. He was dismissed just seven games into the new campaign with the club sitting in 15th position.\n\n\u2022Steve Bruce\n\nSteve Bruce was shown the exit by Newcastle on October 20, 2021.\n\nThe second manager to be sacked in the Premier League came as no surprise to anyone. His dismissal followed their Saudi-led takeover on October 20.\n\nBruce spent two years as Newcastle boss but the new owners, the richest in world football, were naturally looking for a more high-profile manager.\n\n\u2022Nuno Espirito Santo\n\nTottenham confirmed Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s dismissal on November 1, 2021.\n\nNuno was the third Premier League boss to be fired, lasting just 10 games as Tottenham boss before being shown the door.\n\nThe Portuguese had left Wolves at the end of last season before joining Spurs, but failed to impress at Spurs and was given his marching orders with the Lilywhites eighth in the league at the time. He was replaced by Conte.\n\n\u2022Daniel Farke\n\nDaniel Farke was sacked by Norwich City on November 6, 2021. Oddly enough, Farke\u2019s dismissal came right after the club\u2019s first Premier League win of the season, when Farke\u2019s side beat Brentford 2-1.\n\n\u2022Dean Smith\n\nAston Villa dismissed Dean Smith on November 7, 2021, exactly a day after Farke\u2019s sack. Smith was sent packing after a poor start to the season.\n\n\u2022Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\n\nManchester United relieved Ole Gunnar Solskjaer of his duty on November 21, 2021.\n\nSolskjaer departed immediately after the November transfer window closed following a stunning 4-1 loss against Watford.\n\nThe Norwegian had spent much of his near three years in charge doing just enough to dodge the sack only for his luck to run out after a run of five Premier League defeats in seven games.\n\nSolskjaer is undoubtedly the most high-profile to go with the Norwegian having been replaced, in the interim at least by Ralf Rangnick.\n\n\u2022Rafa Benitez\n\nEverton fired Rafa Benitez just sixteen days into 2022.\n\nThe first manager of 2022 to be sacked in the Premier League was shown the way out after going four months without a league win.\n\n\u2022Claudio Ranieri\n\nWatford sacked Claudio Ranieri on Monday January 24, 2022. He\u2019s the second manager to be sacked by the club in the season, just three months after the dismissal of his predecessor, Munoz.\n\nRanieri followed Benitez only eight days later, shortly after watching his Watford side hammered 3-0 by Norwich.\n\nThe latest manager to be dismissed is a veteran Italian coach famous for leading Leicester to the Premier League title in 2015-16.\n\nWatford became the first Premier League team to sack two managers this season, with Ranieri jettisoned after a miserable 3-0 defeat against Norwich, which leaves the Hornets deep in relegation trouble.",

Who denied you? There and then, I made a decision. I said look, you will see Moshood definitely. I overruled whoever said you couldn\u2019t see him. So, I now called my Chief Security Officer (CSO), I said, please make arrangement for this team to see Abiola, that is one point.\u201d\n\nBut in his reaction, Olajide said: \u201cAbdulsalami has told us apparently what he knew about the transition of MKO Abiola. It is left for us to distil the information he has given.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe his entire story about Abiola\u2019s death. If it is true that Abiola was ill, that when he instructed them to bring him to come and meet Ambassador Pickerkng, a sick man would either be restricted to a sickbed in prison or in the hospital.\n\n\u201cSo, for me, I don\u2019t believe him and I am sure most Nigerians will not believe the story.

These funds are helping to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions and the provision of N923 billion in loans to support 251 real sector projects, which has helped in boosting local manufacturing and production across critical sectors.\u201d\n\nAs for Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), its intervention in 2020 alone stood at N191.9 billion via disbursement to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), representing 89 per cent increase when compared to N101.5 billion recorded in 2019.

Click Here Now .\n\nIn his recent interview with African Banker, the Managing Director/ CEO of BoI, Mr Olukayode Pitan, explained various interventions by the bank to cage the pandemic from ruining the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the pandemic began to take its toll on the Nigerian economy, the bank sought partnerships with the Federal Government to manage programmes that would alleviate its negative effects. Some of these programmes included the N75billion MSME Survival Fund: The bank is currently managing the execution of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan MSME Fund (NESP-F) aimed at reviving and re-establishing MSMEs in Nigeria in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A component of the NESP-F is the N75billion MSME Survival Fund, which comprises a N60billion payroll support programme and Artisan Transport Grant, and a N15billion Guaranteed Off-take Scheme. The fund is to be disbursed as grants to support vulnerable MSMES in meeting their staff obligations and to secure jobs within the MSME space from the adverse effects of the pandemic. The scheme is aimed at securing over 1.7million jobs.\n\n\u201cThe bank was also selected to manage the N50billion export expansion fund, which is expected to develop and promote export initiatives. This includes providing financial support to organisations in the non-oil export value chain negatively affected by COVID-19, as well as developing export opportunities and programmes that the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) may identify. The fund also serves as a source of supplementary funding for dealing with high costs of production, marketing and distribution, arising mainly from infrastructure deficiencies and other ancillary factors beyond the control of exporters.\n\n\u201cIn March 2020, BoI successfully closed a \u20ac1billion syndicated guaranteed loan facility. The purpose of the deal has been to enhance the capacity of BoI to effectively support micro, small, medium, and large enterprises across key sectors of the Nigerian economy with affordable loans of medium to long-term tenor, alongside moratorium benefits. It is expected that this support will help revitalise Nigeria\u2019s industrial sector. In addition, we improved our capacity to support Nigerian enterprises by raising about $2.1billion from the international debt capital market in 2020.\u201d",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) yesterday invited reserve bidders for the 2020 marginal fields programme completed in 2021, after some initial bid winners failed to pay up their signature bonuses within the stipulated time.\n\nA public notice signed by the Commission\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, indicated that a number of the winners of the assets could not pay the fee, prompting the organisation to rework the process.\n\nThe commission stated that all offers made to the initial bid winners had lapsed, explaining that by allowing interested reserve bidders to take part in the rest of the process, it will expand the participation of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNotice is hereby given to the general public, and in particular, all recipients of the letter of notification of potential awardee status in the 2020 marginal field bid round that the 45 calendar days allowed for payment of the requisite signature bonus has since lapsed,\u201d the notice showed.\n\nLast week, the NURPC disclosed that the bid round concluded in 2021 had so far yielded about N174.944 billion, with owners of 30 fields having partially paid and two fields stalled by court cases.\n\nThe new commission had further stated that 20 companies which won the bids had partially paid up, from among those who won the 57 oilfields.\n\nIn May 2021, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) which has now transmuted into the NURPC with the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), concluded the oilfield bid round, the first successful exercise since 2003 when 24 assets were put on offer.\n\nThe process which culminated in the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator, started in June 2020, with 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore put up for lease by the federal government.\n\nMarginal fields are smaller oil blocks typically developed by indigenous companies and have remained unproduced for a period of over 10 years.\n\nSome of the companies which emerged winners at the time, included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.\n\nA few others that succeeded in crossing the hurdle and had fully satisfied all conditions were: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil, Virgin Forest among others.\n\nAt the time, it was also a big win for local oil and gas companies in the country, which had a good outing during the ceremony as 100 per cent of the beneficiaries of the exercise were indigenous entities.\n\nBefore then, Nigeria last conducted marginal field bid rounds in 2003, with 16 of the fields contributing just two per cent to the national oil and gas reserves.\n\nBut in the notice, Komolafe promised that all the reserved bidders would be contacted in a short while to show their interest in paying the signature bonuses.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, in line with the rules and guidelines governing the 2020 marginal field bid round and the notification of potential award letters, all offers made to potential awardees who have failed to pay the signature bonus for their respective equity participation have expired by operation of law.\n\n\u201cAnd as such, interests have reverted to the bid basket due to effluxion of time for payment of the applicable signature bonus,\u201d he stated.\n\nFurthermore, the commission noted that the equity of the initial bid winners would be pro-rated, indicating that they would only participate to the extent of their payments.\n\n\u201cThe commission accepts no responsibility or liability in respect of any action or activity by any such potential awardee, their partners, associates, representatives or privies in further pursuit of any consideration or award under the said MFBR.\n\n\u201cParticipating interest for fields where the potential awardees have failed to pay all the required signature bonus will be pro-rated and the portion not paid for has automatically reverted to the bid basket.\n\n\u201cThis will be offered to reserve bidders, in line with paragraph 9 (III) of the MFBR guidelines. This is to ensure maximum participation of a wide cross section of Nigerians,\u201d NURPC stated.\n\nIn addition, the commission explained that eligible reserve bidders will be contacted shortly to provide proof of funds for payment of the applicable signature bonus, as a basis for the issuance of potential award letters for the equity participation taken back into the bid basket.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But that year, militant groups launched a violent campaign as part of a broader upheaval in the Sahel, the vast stretch of land just south of the Sahara.\n\nThe violence has destabilized large parts of the country and has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people and reported 2,000 deaths just last year alone.\n\nThis upheaved has led to mounting public frustration with Mr. Kabor\u00e9, as solution seemed to be beyond him.\n\nThis perhaps led to the coup d\u2019etat adding to worries over military interregnum into governance in the West African region as in the past year, there has been coups in Guinea, Sudan, Chad and Mali.\n\nAccording to agency report, the coup in Burkina Faso was announced on state television late Monday afternoon by a junior army officer who said the army had seized power in response to the \u201cexasperation of the people.\u201d\n\nBeside him sat Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Damiba, a senior military officer who was introduced to the people of Burkina Faso as their new head of state.\n\nThe military said the nation\u2019s land and air borders would be closed, and a nightly curfew imposed until further notice.\n\nThere was no mention of Mr. Kabor\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts and no indication that he had agreed to step down. \u201cThe authorities have been captured without bloodshed and are being kept in a secure place,\u201d the soldier said.\n\nThe military\u2019s announcement came after a turbulent day in the country. Soldiers had on Sunday seized several military bases and the riot police clashed with civilian protesters. In the evening, shots were heard near the president\u2019s home, lasting into the early hours of Monday, setting off hours of uncertainty amid reports that the military was pressuring the president to resign.\n\nIn the afternoon, a tweet had appeared on President Kabor\u00e9\u2019s account that asked people to stand fast behind their tottering democracy. \u201cOur country is going through a difficult time,\u201d he wrote, urging mutinying soldiers to lay down their arms.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian government has condemned the coup d\u2019etat in Burkina Faso, calling for the immediate release of President Marc Christian Kabore and other members of his government being detained by the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government also demanded for the immediate return to the status quo ante.\n\nA statement on Monday by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Francisca Omayuli read:\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria has received with grave concern, reports of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the Republic of Burkina Faso.\n\n\u201cNigeria strongly condemns the overthrow of the democratically elected government of President Roch Marc Kabore and his detention.\n\n\u201cThis unfortunate development not only subverts the constitutional order of the country, but also seeks to further destabilise the peace efforts in the ECOWAS sub-region.\n\n\u201cThis unconstitutional change of government is unacceptable. Nigeria, therefore, calls for the immediate release of President Marc Christian Kabore and other members of his government being detained, as well as an immediate return to the status quo ante.\u201d\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States is expected to also condemn the military take over as with some other countries which had gone the same way.\n\nSanctions are expected to be announced by the regional body to force the military to quickly hand back power to civilian authorities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Dangote Cement, BUA Foods buoy performance\n\n*Increased liquidity responsible for massive gains, experts say\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nGlobal equities suffered their biggest decline in more than a year last week, as heavy losses in Netflix shares accentuated a sell-off in tech stocks that spilled into other sectors. But in Nigeria, it was the opposite, as the market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) appreciated remarkably by 11.05 per cent or N2.46 trillion in the first three weeks of trading in 2022.\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation of the NGX opened in 2022 at N22.297 trillion, and closed last Friday at N24.761 trillion, while the NGX All-Share Index (NGX ASI) grew by 7.6 per cent or 3,240.91 basis points to 45,957.35 basis points, from the 42,716.44 basis points it opened this year.\n\nThe NGX ASI last week reached highest level since January 19, 2018, when it hit 45,092.83 basis points.\n\nThe stock market in the first trading week kicked off on a strong note, gaining N1.33 trillion in market capitalisation. In the second trading week, market capitalisation gained N323 billion week-on-week to close at N23.951 trillion from the N23.628 trillion it had opened for trading.\n\nMarket analysts attributed the strong rally in the market to improvement in the economy, boost in liquidity, as well as investors\u2019 renewed interest in the stock market.\n\nNotably, price appreciation in BUA Foods, BUA Cement Plc, Seplat Energy Plc, Airtel Africa Plc, Dangote Cement Plc, among others, sustained gains recorded in the first three weeks of trading on the NGX, as investors took position on companies with strong fundamentals in anticipation of the release of their 2021 audited financial results and dividend pay-out.\n\nBUA Foods was the most appreciated stock on the Exchange, gaining 61 per cent to close at N64.4 per share, from N40 per share it was when it was listed this year. This was followed by Airtel Africa that has so far gained 21 per cent to close at N1, 155.50 per share, higher that the N955 per share it opened for trading.\n\nSimilarly, the stock price of Dangote Cement added nearly 11 per cent to close last week at N284.9 per share, up from the N257 per share it opened in 2022, while Lafarge Africa Plc rose by 6.1 per cent to close at N25.4 per share, up from N23.9 per share.\n\nSeplat was one of leading stocks on the Exchange, gaining 16.2 per cent to N755.1 last week, from N650 per share it opened for trading, just as BUA Cement gained 6.5 per cent to close at N71.4 per share, from N67.05 the market opened this year.\n\nIn the same vein, Zenith Bank\u2019s stock rose by 2.59 per cent to N25.80, up from N25.15, and FBN Holdings gained 5.3 per cent to N12, from N11.40, both lifting the NGX banking index by 3.22 per cent to close last week at 419.14 basis points.\n\nThe NGX Oil & Gas and Industrial Good indices led others, gaining 9.90 per cent and 8.45 per cent, respectively, in year-to-date (YTD) performance, as Consumer Good recorded a decline of 4.21 per cent YTD growth.\n\nIt was investors bargain hunting in BUA Foods, Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, and International Breweries, which drove the weekly gains.\n\nIn early January 2022, BUA Foods was approved by the management of the NGX to list on the Main Board a total of 18 billion units at N40.00 per share and Dangote Cement announced the commencement of the second tranche of its share buyback programme. The cement manufacturing company said it would be repurchasing 170 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each, representing one per cent of the company\u2019s issued shares.\n\nAccording to the company, this includes 40.2 million shares held as treasury shares, following the conclusion of Tranche I of the share buyback programme. It said the transaction would take place at the open market on the NGX, subject to prevailing market conditions and under the current daily trading rules of the Bourse.\n\nHowever, Vice President, Highcap Securities, Mr. David Adnori, noted that increase in macroeconomic activities as well as liquidity following a successful bid in bond market in December boosted the stock market lately.\n\nAccording to Adnori, \u201cTowards the end of 2021, a lot of investors subscribed to the debt market and it was oversubscribed. Some of those funds are now being invested in the stock market, a major reason we are witnessing appreciation in market performance.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have seen activities that have attracted investors into the stock market. The BUA Foods listing, the transactions by Airtel in East Africa, and Dangote Cement share buyback have impacted on the market in the last three weeks.\n\n\u201cOverall, the market is driven by information regarding anticipation towards 2021 full year results and accounts. Investors are investing in stocks with good fundamentals and dividend paying stock on NGX.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer, APT securities & Funds Limited, Mallam Garba Kurfi, attributed the growth to various activities by listed companies on the NGX.\n\nKurfi said, \u201cWe have seen the issue of Dangote Cement share buyback, the BUA Foods listing. We have also seen many investors trying to balance their portfolio and it has contributed to the volume of transactions recorded in the last three months.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital, however stated, \u201cIn the week ahead, we believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting to gain further clarity on the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we expect a \u2018choppy theme\u2019, as cautious trading will likely dominate the market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks, as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, investors have raced out of speculative corners of the US market, as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten financial conditions. It reported that share decline had been particularly extreme in the US, where many of last year\u2019s high-flying tech companies were listed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 7.6 per cent this week, its biggest slide since the coronavirus pandemic rocked US financial markets in March 2020.\n\nThe blue-chip S&P 500 index, the closely followed barometer of the $50 trillion US stock market, shed 5.7 per cent over the past week. More than two-thirds of the companies within the index are now in a technical correction \u2014 or down at least 10 per cent from their record high \u2014 including 149 stocks that declined 20 per cent or more.\n\nThe FTSE All-World index of developed and emerging market shares has fallen 4.2 per cent since last Friday, recording its steepest weekly decline since October 2020.\n\nAmong the hardest hit US stocks was Netflix, which tumbled 22 per cent on Friday after the streaming group warned subscriber growth would slow substantially. The decline shaved about $49bn from its valuation, or roughly the market capitalisation of foods group Kraft Heinz.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The stock market in the first trading week kicked off on a strong note, gaining N1.33 trillion in market capitalisation.\nIn the second trading week, market capitalisation gained N323 billion week-on-week to close at N23.951 trillion from the N23.628 trillion it had opened for trading.\nMarket analysts attributed the strong rally in the market to improvement in the economy, boost in liquidity, as well as investors\u2019 renewed interest in the stock market.\nIt was investors bargain hunting in BUA Foods, Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, and International Breweries, which drove the weekly gains.\nSome of those funds are now being invested in the stock market, a major reason we are witnessing appreciation in market performance.",

The third bloodiest day of the year after February 5, was March 2.\n\nOn this day, over 50 people were killed in Igabi local government in Kaduna State.\n\nA witness to the attack said newborns and almajiris were not spared in the carnage.\n\nThe witness said the bandits, whom he kept describing as Boko Haram, stole nothing and even cremated some of the persons they had already murdered.\n\n20 days later, bandits expressed their fearlessness, killing 29 security officials made up of the army, the police and Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps in Niger State.\n\nThe area of Niger where the engagement happened is close to the Birnin Gwari Local Government where the bandits hold sway.\n\nIn April\n\nLife Count recorded 183 deaths in the fourth month of the year.\n\nThe bloodiest day was April 19.\n\nBandits invaded a village in Katsina State, killing 34 and carting away as much foodstuff as their 200 motorcycle cavalcade could carry.\n\nA source said the raiders came for the government palliatives given to the residents whose lives have been under the grip of the killers and rustlers.\n\nSix days before that, two communities in Taraba State continued their feud over some ancestral fishing ponds, 25 persons were killed in the latest episode of the communal clash.\n\nPrior to both attacks, bandits raided Sokoto, another North-Western state.\n\nThe attack which left 22 persons dead, is said to have lasted for three uninterrupted hours.\n\nIn May\n\nMay was the third bloodiest month of CML\u2019s Life Count collation.\n\nAbout 252 persons were killed in 35 reported incidents.\n\nThere were three incidents with deaths over 20 and above during this 31-day period.\n\nThe most brutal of them was the murder of 74 persons in Sokoto State.\n\nThe raid on Sabom Birni came just a day after the governor, Aminu Tambuwal, paid a visit in company with his security chiefs.\n\nThe other two major attacks were 20 each in Kaduna and Borno.\n\nIn June\n\nAfter February\u2019s 460 was June\u2019s 395.\n\nIn this month, a village in Borno State was completely raised to the ground by an armed group not labeled as Boko Haram.\n\nOn June 10, the group killed 81 persons, who were herding their cattle in an open field.\n\nThose, who tried to escape the shooting were run down with vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nThe village head was kidnapped, before the village itself was burnt down.\n\nFour days after that, Boko Haram/ISWAP killed 40 civilians and 20 soldiers in the same state.\n\nThe same day, Felo Village was burnt, 50 persons were killed in five villages in Katsina.\n\nThe attack was linked to bandits.\n\nThe National Assembly, which is dominated by representatives from the Northern region of the country, have asked the President to freshen up the offices occupied by his service chiefs.\n\nIt is a request the President has not deem fit to agree to.\n\nMany of the communities being attacked are agrarian in nature.\n\nFarmers in these places are finding it impossible to earn a living.\n\nObservers feel Nigeria\u2019s food import bill will continue to soar if it cannot till all the hectares of farmland available to it due to the incessant bloodshed across the country especially in the Northern region.",

          "title": "Norebase wants to be the node that fuses Africa into a country",
          "text": "In 2019, a few months after the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA) was signed, some African tech and creative industry players were hosted by CcHUB in Kigali, Rwanda, to discuss how the tech and creative ecosystem could leverage the newly signed agreement.\n\nIn that room, among 80 participants from 30 countries, was Tola Onayemi, a young lawyer who was in the middle of everything. Onayemi was the assistant chief negotiator and head of trade remedies at the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations. So, at the time of the meeting, he was at the forefront\u2014leading the technical negotiations of the AfCFTA on behalf of Nigeria.\n\nAt the core of the discussion was trade facilitation issues and everybody in the room, big and important in their own right, knew Onayemi as the go-to kid for the subject matter; he was the exact intersection between tech, law, and trade\u2014the three parts that form a successful cross-border business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHaving drafted the Nigerian Ease of Doing Business Policy and advised the Nigerian vice president on industry, trade, and investment before moving to lead the AfCFTA, Onayemi had an idea what the continent needed\u2014Africa had to be a \u201ccountry\u201d to win in the global market.\n\nAfter the Kigali meet-up, COVID-19 hit and the momentum died down. But around late 2020 when countries began to ease the lockdown and open their borders, founders began to reach out to Onayemi to help them in their expansion efforts. He handled a couple of these as ad-hoc services and then began to see his idea of \u201cCountry Africa\u201d unfolding like a morning flower\u2014slow but significant.\n\n\u201cPeople would reach out to me and say, \u2018You\u2019re a lawyer and you are also knowledgeable about trade and tech; you\u2019re the perfect advisor and middle person to help us get into any market.\u2019 So I helped them expand,\u201d Onayemi told TechCabal. \u201cAnd then over time, I just realised there\u2019s something here. So, I started discussing it with Tope Obanla, my co-founder, to see if there\u2019s something here we could build.\u201d\n\nFast forward to June 2021, Onayemi and Obanla were finally ready to roll Africa into a country with their tradetech startup Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks and patent an Intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nTola Onayemi, co-founder and CEO at Norebase. Image credit: Terna Iwar\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360 degree business launchpad: business registrations, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nExpansion across Africa can be tedious. Even though there are similar problems across the continent\u2019s countries, there are just too many impediments that frustrate the process. There are issues of legal frameworks, language barriers, smug policies, cultural disparities, and other nuances.\n\nAlthough most of these impediments can\u2019t be erased overnight, Norebase is building a node that at least takes the burden of scaling these brickwalls off the shoulders of business owners.\n\nAt the core, the company is helping African companies expand, but as they take on more businesses they realise they need to do more than just help companies to start in a new market.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t just want to help businesses launch in a new market; we want to also help them operate and scale across Africa quickly and safely without experiencing all the fractions of doing so,\u201d said Onayemi, who was also the founding legal partner at Future Africa, an Africa-focused early-stage venture fund.\n\nEssentially, Norebase wants to be the partner a business would need to operate in a new African market. All it takes are a few clicks away.\n\nOnayemi believes expansion for most African businesses isn\u2019t a want but a need. Most African countries don\u2019t really have a population size that has the disposable income to fuel a unicorn or a wildly successful business. Hence the expansion into more markets.\n\nTola Onayemi by Terna Iwar\n\n\u201cYou have to be in several markets because there\u2019s a disposable income gap in most markets. In Nigeria, for instance, after you do Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt, you are kind of stuck thinking of the next place to find your audience. What happens if you can\u2019t find it? Then you\u2019ll start looking into Accra or Nairobi.\u201d\n\nOnayemi also thinks African businesses need to expand to reduce their vulnerability and derisk against unfavourable regulations that may throw them off course. \u201cIt\u2019s a survival strategy and a way to edge against unfavourable markets. For instance, what happens when Nigeria says no more cryptocurrency or motorcycles?\u201d\n\nBig companies that have expanded into different markets have in-house expansion teams and keep their learnings private. This means that other companies, especially smaller startups that are operating on a lean budget, would have to go through the same mistakes before getting it right. Norebase is solving the problem of trial and error due to the information silo.\n\nLike every other company playing in the African market, Norebase has both online and offline solutions. Its online expansion solution covers Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and Kenya. In addition to these four countries, its offline offer is extended to Senegal, Egypt, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and more. Onayemi said, while you can only access their expansion offering to select counties for now, you can file trademark and IP across the 55 countries in Africa.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a base fee, depending on the country of expansion. Onayemi said they are constantly making price savings for their customers. As a venture-backed impact company, Norebase\u2019s objective is to first ensure that businesses get into new markets.\n\n\u201cWhat you see happening is that we\u2019re actually constantly pushing down prices so, for instance, our price for Kenya between March and December last year was cut by almost 70%.\u201d\n\nOnayemi said the goal of their pricing strategy is to get to a point where incorporating in any African country will only cost $500. The startup has helped companies like Patricia and Brass, among others, to expand into new markets.\n\nNorebase is tackling a big problem involving multiple government bureaucracies and it wishes to create an environment where founders aren\u2019t restricted to their native countries. Imagine a Kenyan choosing to build in Egypt and the other way round without bothering about running into walls. If AfCFTA wants to create a single African market, think of Norebase as a tool that will power its efficiency. Onayemi believes this will encourage African governments to create policies that support their local businesses.\n\nFor Norbase, the ambition is big and almost sounds impossible because of the precedence set by the present intra-African business and information exchange. But the startup is filled with relentless individuals with an unmatched focus to make this work.\n\n\u201cIn order to accomplish our audacious target, we\u2019re keen on building a culture that attracts talents from the biggest companies in the world,\u201d Onayemi said. \u201cWe hire people with a leadership mindset. People who are founders in their own right.\u201d\n\nAccording to Onayemi, he and his team are building the most significant company in Africa, and when they succeed, the whole African tech and business ecosystem wins. Besides him being a trade leader, his co-founder is an ex-Goldman Sachs associate and a senior engineer at Microsoft.\n\nIn conclusion, even though he didn\u2019t specifically say what they are, Onayemi hinted that the company is launching new products that will \u201cchange the game\u201d, especially fintech startups. The phrase \u201cchange the game\u201d sounds like a founder pitching investors, but it\u2019s Onayemi and his antecedent is enough to take him to be serious and anticipate these products.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tesla\u2019s African expansion is imminent but is it reasonable to drive one in Lagos?",
          "text": "Every time a picture of an electric vehicle being driven on African soil shows up on social media, a popular recurring sarcastic comment from many Nigerians is that electric cars generally shouldn\u2019t be used on the continent yet.\n\nThis belief was evident in the responses to a recent picture of a Tesla being towed off Lagos\u2019s Third Mainland Bridge. The popular speculation was that the car ran out of power\u2014since, unlike its fossil fuel-powered sibling, it can\u2019t simply be refuelled. Contrary to these speculations, the real cause was a tire blowout.\n\nGranted these remarks hold some merit as many African countries do not have the supporting infrastructure, and very few electric cars are sold in Africa. Tesla, the most renowned electric vehicle (EV) brand globally, sells its vehicles in about 40 countries across 5 continents, except Africa and Antarctica. Other big players in the EV space adopt a similar approach.\n\nBut there are signs this will be changing soon. In November 2020, Hyundai unveiled its first Nigerian electric car named Hyundai Kona. Tesla made its first move on the African continent in October 2021 by installing 4150 kW Supercharging stations at the Tangier Al Houara Hilton Resort and the Onomo Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco. In South Africa, tech company Rubicon recently became the official Tesla partner in the country. The agreement currently only covers the company selling Tesla charging infrastructure.\n\nBased on precedents, establishing charging networks is usually the first step Tesla takes before directly selling cars into a market, setting up showrooms and rolling out service centres. The use of charging stations gives a sense of the general demand for Tesla cars.\n\nTesla, which is currently the market leader, sold almost a million electric cars in 2021. But competition in the EV space is heating up as veteran carmakers, General Motors and Volkswagen, both sold over 200,000 EVs each last year. 118-year-old Ford last year entered the EV race with a rather ambitious target of producing 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023. Rivian\u2014at 9 years\u2014also joined in the race with a market cap of $94 billion, despite having not sold a single car yet.\n\nAnswering the big question\n\nWhile all these moves hint that the expansion of electric car companies to Africa is inevitable, it doesn\u2019t answer the question on many people\u2019s minds: Can electric cars thrive on the African continent?\n\nAlkesh Thavrani, Chief Business Development Officer at fintech startup Bitsika, who owns and drives a Tesla model X around Lagos and neighbouring cities, believes his experience is a testament that electric cars can thrive in Africa.\n\nThavrani\u2019s Tesla Model X, which costs $90,000, was bought in 2019. The addition of shipping and customs fees (about 70% of the value of the car) brought the cost to about $150,000. The car came with a charger (220-volt outlet adapter) and additionally purchased a home wall charger which cost about $500\u2013600.\n\nA front view of the Tesla Model X with one set of doors opened\n\nThavrani drives the Tesla to his office and other functions during the week and typically returns to full charge overnight.\n\n\u201cYou plug it in at night and by morning you have a full battery, just like you do to your phone,\u201d Oluwatobi Ismail, a Nigerian automotive engineer who runs Smile motors which services the Tesla, said.\n\nBreaking down the charging speed and capacity of the different chargers, he explained that the level one, which is the slowest taking from 18\u201340 hours to charge to full capacity when empty, provides about 120 volts. The next is the level two, which provides between 208-240 volts, restoring an empty battery life to full in about 8 hours. The fastest is the level three (supercharger) which handles 400 to 900 volts and charges the battery to full capacity in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe car charging port\n\nThe Tesla wall Connector installed in Thavrani\u2019s house\n\nBattery life and mileage of the car\n\n\u201cAt full charge, the car can go about 500 km,\u201d Ismail said. It\u2019s slightly less if the air conditioner/heater is used. For context, a trip from Lagos to Ibadan is about 125km. This means the Tesla Model X can complete a round trip on one full charge. He points out that there\u2019s also a mobile charger that can be taken around in the car in case plans change.\n\nNigerian roads are notorious for traffic jams, so what happens when the car is stuck in traffic? Fortunately, Tesla cars are equipped with regenerative braking, a feature that uses the excess energy produced by a moving vehicle to charge the batteries, thus slowing down the car. Depending on the speed at which the vehicle moves, it can gain back as high as 80% of the energy generated via regenerative braking.\n\nWhat happens when the battery reaches zero? It\u2019s possible that the car will still drive for a few more kilometers. Different Tesla car owners have reported driving about 16-32km at 0% before their cars come to a final halt\u2014Tesla strongly advises against doing this.\n\nThis is possible because just like your smartphone, battery life percentage is an estimation of how much battery is left based on the rate at which the voltage is discharged\u2014the pressure of voltage output is strong when the battery is full and weaker when it\u2019s low. In addition, there are other factors that influence the estimate, this explains why your phone sometimes lasts longer on 1%.\n\n\u201cTo put things in perspective, driving from Yaba to Ikoyi is less than 15km. Now with all these in place, you have to be reckless to be stranded due to no battery power,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nCost charging and maintenance\n\nThe maximum household rate of power in Lagos is about \u20a632/kWh according to Ikeja distribution company. To estimate how much it costs to charge a Tesla Model X\u2019s battery, we multiply it by the size of the battery: 100 KW. This means the cost of charging the battery fully is \u20a63,200 (~$6). This can take the car for a week or two or even a month depending on your driving habits. For Thavrani, when he\u2019s not travelling long distances, he can go a week or two without needing to charge the car\n\nHow does this stack up against a fossil fuel-powered car?\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re driving a similar fossil fuel-powered car as thirsty as this, you\u2019ll be spending at least \u20a615,000 per week on fuel. The tires will wear out faster because it\u2019ll be heavier than this and your car won\u2019t be as fast as this,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, what Ismail has mostly done is inspection so far. \u201cWe typically just check the air filters, oil, and shock absorbers. We haven\u2019t had to replace anything apart from tires.\u201d\n\nNotably, the car doesn\u2019t come with spare tires, which Babatunde claims is a common trend in many other new cars. The cost of replacing the Tesla\u2019s tire (20-inch rims) is about \u20a6110,000 (~$200) for each tire.\n\nWhen I asked if that wasn\u2019t too expensive, Ismail insisted he thinks it\u2019s fair. He recently bought a tire for \u20a6330,000 (~$600) for an SUV. \u201cThese days I don\u2019t think any tire would cost less than \u20a620,000 (~$36.4) and that\u2019s a cheap brand,\u201d he said.\n\nTobi Ismail driving the Telsa\n\nDealing with accidents and bad roads\n\nAnyone who drives in Lagos knows that it\u2019s nearly impossible to not be hit and scratched by other cars. In the case of Thavrani\u2019s Tesla, most of the incidents have been scratches and dents, which are fixed all at once after they pile up.\n\nMany Lagos roads are notorious for being in bad conditions but Thavrani has found a way to navigate through these bad roads. How? By cleverly adjusting the ride height of the car, a feature that allows the driver to increase or reduce the height of the car from the floor. Bad roads also mean that he\u2019s not able to use the auto-pilot feature except on roads with clearly defined lanes like the Third mainland bridge or Bourdillon, Ikoyi.\n\nAbout a year ago, there was a major incident that affected the car suspension\u2014the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allow relative motion between the two. How easy was that to fix?\n\n\u201cFixing is straightforward but we don\u2019t have Tesla parts in Ladipo market [a popular market for buying vehicle parts in Lagos] so we had to order parts from Tesla US,\u201d Ismail said. The process of ordering could often be a hassle, he added.\n\nCompared to a similar fossil fuel car, Babatunde believes it\u2019s cheaper to maintain a Tesla.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it\u2019s cheaper to maintain. For a car like this that costs about $90,000, we\u2019d change oil at least two times because it\u2019ll have a V8 engine, each time will cost \u20a650,000 (~$90). You\u2019ll change transmission fluid every 2,000km, along the way you\u2019ll have to change the valves and water pump.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that counts in favour of the Tesla is that it has fewer moving parts (about 150 parts) compared to a fossil fuel-powered car which has 30,000 parts if you count all parts down to the nuts and bolts. If you consider large parts such as the engine as one part, it comes down to about 1,800 separate parts.\n\nThe trunk of the Tesla Model X is used as storage space because it doesn\u2019t have an internal combustion engine.\n\n\u201cIn a regular car\u2019s engine you have about 200 moving parts, so if you take this out because it doesn\u2019t exist in a Tesla, that\u2019s 200 less things that can break. When you look at your automatic transmission, that\u2019s another 800 less things that can break. So you\u2019ve reduced your problems by like 1,000,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nWhen I asked him between the Tesla (Electric Vehicles) and fossil fuel-powered cars, which would he recommend, with a straight face before bursting into laughter, he said, \u201cBased on my profession I\u2019ll recommend fossil fuel-powered cars because there are more things to fix and I have to eat.\u201d\n\nA general source of concern for many people about electric cars is the credibility of the technology supporting electric cars, as they aren\u2019t familiar with it. Ismail thinks the technology is nothing new.\n\n\u201cThis technology has been around for a long time. It\u2019s been tried, tested and trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same technology you have in your hybrid vehicles. Those cars have been around since 2005. They\u2019ve worked so well that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to be upgraded into fully electric vehicles. All they\u2019ve done is make the battery bigger.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about four years, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. While still running his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\nChari\u2019s warehouse\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

We have the lowest number of out-of-school children in Nigeria on account of our reforms.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration has launched and recruited teachers under the EdoSTAR Teaching Fellows Programme to ensure quality teaching and learning in public schools in the state, Obaseki said Edo has put in place the necessary infrastructure and institutions to train teachers in the use of technology, which will enable them to train children and imbue in them the culture of technology from a tender age.\n\n\u201cWe plan to deepen ongoing reforms in the state\u2019s education sector, build the capacity of our teachers to domesticate the EdoBEST model, maintain physical infrastructure across schools in the state as well as intensify rebuilding structures, processes, and equipment at our tertiary institutions, among others,\u201d Obaseki reassured.\n\n...",

          "title": "Climate activist, Obasi rallies African youths to demand more commitment in effort against climate change",
          "text": "Prince Emeka Obasi Jnr., a climate activist and founder of \u2018Our Tomorrow Foundation,\u2019 a non governmental organisation leading an African focused campaign against climate chance, has emphasized the need for the youths of the continent to wake up to the reality of the danger climate change poses to their future and begin to demand action from policy makers.\n\nObasi, a Nigerian born British undergraduate who spoke in this interview, regretted that despite the huge threat climate change poses to the survival of the African continent, there is still little awareness among the people of the continent, particularly the youths. This, he said, has to change, and according to him, it\u2019s part of the reason he thought it necessary to come up with an NGO to drive the change.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nRecently, you launched a climate NGO, \u2018Our Tomorrow.\u2019 Tell us about the initiative and what prompted you to set it up?\n\nBasically, I decided to set up the NGO because I was alarmed by the lack of awareness about the dangers of climate change on the continent, and the lack of urgency in tackling the crisis in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. Particularly, I noticed that there is this lack of awareness among the youths about the dangers of climate change. I often use my experience as an example to highlight this lack of awareness. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria in 2001 and would spend the first 15 years of my life in the country. But it\u2019s strange that despite being interested in current affairs, especially given that my father is a Journalist, I never became aware of the environmental crisis which had begun to endanger Lagos until I came to England for my college education in 2017. As I wrote in my letter to African youths some days ago, it was while here in England that I became increasingly aware of the problems of the environment and the challenges they pose, particularly to African countries. So my idea is to create this awareness and to galvanize the youths to begin to demand action from policy makers with regard to tackling the issues that lead to climate change and its effects.\n\nBut specifically, what can we expect from the NGO? What will it be doing in this regard?\n\nSpecifically, Our Tomorrow has three broad agenda: the first is to wake African youths up to the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to their future. The second is to sensitize African leaders, both those in government and those in the corporate environment, to begin to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change. Thirdly, to mobilize resources, both material and human resources, to create sustained awareness of Africans, particularly the youths on the need to be actively involved in this battle to save our environment for future generations.\n\nWhat activities do you have, or pan to drive these objectives?\n\nYes, we will be holding a press conference on Tuesday, January 25th at the University of Lagos to formally announce the NGO. Our website is also live and we will be laying out some of our activities there. We intend to launch the NGO formerly in London in the coming months. But between the time of the press conference and the formal launch in London, I\u2019ll be traveling to different African countries and different states across Nigeria such as Kebbi, Rivers Anambra and so on, to observe the impact of climate change in these environments. Subsequently, I will travel across Africa, to places like Rwanda, Kenya and some other countries to continue to create this awareness about climate crisis. I believe it is important for people to begin to visualise the threat of climate change. I believe that\u2019s the way it will be easier to highlight its seriousness to be able to mobilize action.\n\nBut do you think that in a continent where majority of the people are still concerned about what to eat, many will consider climate change such a big issue to bother about? I mean, why should they care?\n\nWell, I agree with you that the socioeconomic realities of our continent is an issue. But I also think that there is a general misunderstanding about the climate change crisis. It is not a zero-sum game. I mean, people tend to think that they would rather be addressing the problem of hunger and poverty than be concerned about climate change. But in reality, there is a link and I will explain to you how. Climate change is already a huge problem and a big threat to food security and security in general in Africa, and it is likely going to get worse if it is not urgently tackled. Obviously, it is already contributing to food insecurity, population displacement, and it is going to put a lot of stress on water resources. Studies have shown that coastal degradation and erosion are going to be major challenge in West Africa. About 56% of the coastlines in Benin Republic, Ivory Coast, and Senegal are already eroding. You have erosion in many parts of Nigeria, such as the south-east. You can see the encroaching desertification in the north, which has hugely contributed to the security crisis we are witnessing in the region and the food crisis in Nigeria. The farmers versus herders crisis is largely driven by climate change. We are seeing the impact. Farmers are not able to go to the farms, which means that food supply is affected. Prices of food are going up as a result.\n\nSo, climate crisis is going to affect agriculture significantly and when you consider the fact that agriculture is the backbone of the African economy, employing millions of people, you will begin to appreciate the enormity of the problem that presently confront us. So, yes climate change should be the concern of the average African, whether rich or poor because at the end of the day, it is a problem that affects everybody. First of all, food has become more expensive. So, I think everybody should be concerned about what is happening to our climate and indeed it is everybody\u2019s problem and demands that everybody begins to talk about it and begins to demand action from those that have the capacity to make changes.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you have highlighted the threats of climate change here. But it doesn\u2019t seem to matter so much to policy makers on the continent. Have you seen significant action on their part in this regard?\n\nUnfortunately, No. I don\u2019t think policy makers on the continent have done enough, quite frankly. However, increasingly, I think more people are beginning to realise the threat that climate change poses. For example, I saw the president of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari speaking at the recently concluded conference on climate change at Glasgow, Scotland, COP26. He did a good job of highlighting the need for developed countries to step up the effort in tackling climate change. But at the same time, I think African leaders need to increasingly vocalise the danger climate change poses to everyday lives of people on the continent; the dangers it poses to farming and to the stability of the continent in general.\n\nI also think it\u2019s important to also have collaboration among the countries on the continent, because at the end of the day it is a continental problem; it is indeed a global problem. But we can begin to tackle it at the continental level, particularly in sub-saharan Africa. There needs to be collaboration, for instance, among ECOWAS countries, the southern African countries, the Central African states, the East African countries and so on. What is important is that there should be collaborative effort across the board. Individual states taking action on their own may not achieve much results. Better results will be achieved when states come together to take serious steps against, for instance, desertification, by pooling resources together, to consider for instance afforestation. There should also be preventive actions which could be led by the United Nations or the African Union. That\u2019s some of the things that we should be looking at. Africa should work together and collaboratively with other parts of the world to achieve better results.\n\nYou pointed out that Buhari demanded more action from the developed world at COP26. I mean, that\u2019s a sentiment many people share given that these developed countries are mostly responsible for the climate crisis we face?\n\nOf course, this is a sentiment that I also share. The developed world must take the lead in the fight against climate change, simply because they are responsible for most of the global emissions. The developed world must help fund the fight against climate change in the developing world also because we do not have the resources in this part of the world to effectively deal with effects of climate change. And then, when you consider that the issues of climate we face on the continent were brought about by mostly the activities of the advanced economies \u2013 Africa contributes only 5% of global emissions \u2013 it becomes important that the developed world begin to take the lead in terms of funding initiative aimed at tackling climate change.\n\nIndeed, during the recently concluded climate change events held in Glasgow, the climate pact to deliver $100 billion dollars a year to African countries most affected by climate change was finalized. So, to that extent, I think there are gradual steps towards helping developing countries contain the effect of climate change. But I think a lot still needs to be done because of the enormity of the challenge. But as I said earlier, African countries cannot fold their arms and wait for the advanced economics to do everything. There should also be action from the leaders of the continent.\n\nYou are in the UK, and as you pointed out, you became aware about issues of climate there. But I also know that in UK and the rest of the Western world, there is climate denialism. How much of a challenge is it to the quest of tackling climate change?\n\nOf course, climate change denialism is a very serious problem, especially in the West. You know, it is ironic that even though the West is largely responsible for the climate catastrophe that now confront us, they are going to be the least impacted by it, compared to countries in Africa and other developing regions of the world. So, it is easy for some individuals there to deny the impact of climate change, or to deny the existence of climate change, like the past president of the United States. So, what you see is that these people have promoted resentment against some of the initiatives that are being developed to tackle climate change, and even resentment against the idea that developing countries should be helped to fund climate initiatives. It is a very big problem, but thankfully it is also changing gradually. Some of the public figures who were at the forefront of climate change denialism have been voted out of power. In the United States for example, since Joe Biden became president, the country has rejoined the Climate Accord that was first signed in 2015. We have seen encouraging signs that the international community is back on track as a united front against climate change.The denialists are being denied some of the voice that they used to have.\n\nThe quest you have embarked upon is a noble one, but you are a student. This sort of campaign requires resources. Have you thought about that?\n\nYes, but that\u2019s not an issue we are dwelling on. I mean, this is not about the traditional fundraising. I am more interested in developing more innovative approach to the issue of funding. But it\u2019s too early to talk about these things now. We would rather pursue our objectives now. Our concern is to ensure that we get our message across to youths of Africa and to influence policies aimed at tackling the impact of climate change. And of course, in finance once you create a good product, there will always be market for it. So, the issue of funding is secondary. The primary thing is building a critical mass to push the agenda of tackling climate change.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to note that while most of the discussions about climate change have centered on the cost of action against it, experts have continued to warn that cost of inaction is much higher. And we are talking hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the decade, probably much worse. Consider for instance, what Africa would lose if the Sahel region is allowed to cave in to desertification. It would destroy wildlife and the livelihoods of millions. Certainly, the cost of planting trees, etc, to ensure that the region continues to support lives will be little in comparison. These are some of the the things we need to make people, especially policy makers, understand. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea if a fraction of that cost is dedicated to awareness campaigns.\n\nWhat is your message to the youths of Africa who are the focus of your NGO?\n\nFor me, the message is for them; the youths of Africa, to wake up to the reality of climate, change knowing that we are the leaders of tomorrow. We are the inheritors of this continent and must begin to fight to ensure that the continent we inherit from our parents is not one that will be riddled in crisis; one where food insecurity and famine will become the order of the day. We must also remember that we have an obligation to leave this continent a better place for those coming after us. So, we must begin to do something today.\n\nI will say to us that the future of the continent is in their hands and is it is up to us to ensure that today\u2019s leaders take action to ensure that tomorrow we are not left with a landscape that is beset by draught, desertification, erosion, food insecurity, among others. So we should all wake up and take charge of our future and demand action from our present leaders. It is a duty we owe to ourselves and to the generations coming after us and we cannot fail. We cannot afford to betray that duty. For me, it is a struggle of a lifetime; one that I feel very honoured to answer and one that I hope every youth of the continent should be honoured to answer.",

          "title": "Osinbajo appeals to world leaders to fulfill $100b climate change pledge",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo has appealed to the global community to fulfill the $100b pledged to African countries for mitigation of climate change activities\n\nOsinbajo who made the plea in his presentation at the virtual edition of the 2022 World Economic Forum featuring leaders from across the world, urged the international community to \u201cmeet its pledge recently re-affirmed at COP-26 of providing $100 billion annually in climate finance to support climate change efforts in developing countries.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian vice president noted that although Africans are working towards the globally accepted net-zero future, they are also conscious that \u201cour energy needs are increasing with the growth in our economies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him to him, \u201cWe need to ramp up energy access in response to this situation which is why the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies must be just and fair.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that despite the giant strides recorded across Africa, the Continent still has challenges to overcome.\n\nHe stated that we need partnerships that help to tackle climate change, address security concerns, promote economic prosperity, combat disease, and improve governance.\n\nThe 2022 virtual edition of the forum features a mix of visionary \u201cstate of the world\u201d special addresses and ambitious high-level leadership panels focusing on critical collective challenges, among others.\n\nOsinbajo listed some of the progress on the African continent, including the recovery from the global pandemic, economic growth by 3.7 percent last year, and a projected 3.8 percent growth in 2022. He also noted that there is now in place an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to fast-track economic transformation just as the continent is making giant strides in agriculture, manufacturing, and digital technology. He added that in Nigeria for instance, 6 unicorns have emerged in the past six years.\n\nOn the issue of peace and security, the Vice President said \u201cAfrican countries face a serious threat of terrorism arising from the encroachment of global terror groups and their franchises into Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for the international community to make more robust interventions to clear terrorists from Africa just as it did in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The United Nations Security Council must find unanimity in working with and assisting African countries to eradicate the menace of terrorism in the continent once and for all.\u201d\n\nOn the climate change challenge, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cit is now common knowledge that Africa contributes least to climate change but has been most negatively affected by it. We must not allow this worrying situation to be compounded further by global inaction, processes, and rules that make it difficult for Africa to adapt to climate change or indeed to develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are emphatic in our view that natural gas which Africa has in abundance must be accepted as a transition fuel. Moves in the international community especially by development finance institutions to defund gas projects will have severe implications in the medium to long-term for African economies and will slow down the process of phasing out more polluting fuels such as coal, diesel, and heavy fuel oil (HFO),\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to climate finance, the Vice President called for a partnership to tackle poverty, access vaccinations, and achieve debt sustainability.\n\n\u201cEconomic recovery in Africa is contingent on the containment of the pandemic including through wide-spread vaccinations. Right now, less than 10% of African countries have vaccinated 40% of their population.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that due to resource constraints, there will be a relatively slow rollout of vaccinations in Africa and that full national rollouts may take several years.\n\n\u201cThe international community must accordingly support Africa with the resources including vaccine doses that will assist in making vaccinations available to all,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo emphasized.\n\nAnother point made by the VP in his special address is the call on the international community to support African countries overcome fiscal challenges arising from their limited revenues.\n\nAccording to Prof. Osinbajo, \u201cthe creation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights last year was a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to enable African and other developing countries access the SDRs that are not needed or being used by developed or emerging economies.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also urged multilateral organizations to consider the huge obligations placed on African countries and adopt debt relief initiatives such as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments in a manner that will not further constrain the resumption of growth to the continent.\n\nHe called on the international community to support the efforts of West African leaders under the auspices of ECOWAS particularly, their condemnation of the incidences of coup d\u2019etats and unconstitutional changes in government.",

          "title": "Fuel Subsidy: Federal Govt, States Head For Showdown Over FAAC Remittances",
          "text": "The state and federal governments are set for a showdown over the planned suspension of fuel subsidy removal which has been the reason for the persistent poor remittances to the federation account by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe federal government yesterday announced it would not go ahead with the subsidy removal until further notice.\n\nThe suspension was announced when the chairman of the National Assembly, who is also the Senate president, Ahmad Lawan, met with the minister of finance, Zainab Ahmed, minister of state for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, and the group managing director (GMD) of the NNPC, Mele Kyari.\n\nThe federal government gave assurance that there will not be fuel subsidy removal until all mechanisms are put in place to cushion the effect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nState governors have consistently maintained their call for the removal of fuel subsidy because it reduces what is distributed to them from the monthly federal allocations.\n\nSince 2021, the NNPC has been paying for fuel subsidy by direct deduction from proceeds of crude oil sales. This trend has persistently affected its remittances to the federation account, thus resulting in lower monthly allocations to the state governments.\n\nLEADERSHIP recalls that the National Economic Council (NEC) estimated that the NNPC consistently failed to remit the expected N200 billion monthly to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) because of payment of fuel subsidy.\n\nIn 2021 alone, petrol subsidy payments gulped N1.43 trillion, shrinking revenue accrued to the federation account to N542 billion, representing a whopping shortfall from the projected N2.51 trillion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have mobilise their members for a possible nationwide picketing if the government removes fuel subsidy.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the removal of the subsidy on PMS will see the price rise from N162-N165 to over N300 per litre, an amount the union and the CSOs say will adversely affect every aspect of the economy and things harder for longsuffering vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nThe minister of finance, Zainab Ahmed, who presented the stand of the federal government on the subsidy, had begged union leaders to shelve their planned strike action.\n\nAccording to the minister, one of the reasons the removal of the subsidy cannot work is that fact funds needed to cushion the effects were not provided for in the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cIssues around fuel subsidy removal came after the budget was passed. Consultations were made with stakeholders and it was discovered that there is still high inflation in the country,\u201d Zainab said, adding that modalities will be put in place to ensure the effects of subsidy removal are lessened.\n\n\u201cThere would be rehabilitation of the whole refineries in the country that will ensure refining of products locally,\u201d Zainab said, adding that the possible date for the removal of the fuel subsidy is not certain but that June 2022 is something they are working on if there is legislative backing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDiscussion is ongoing between labour unions to ensure the removal is done gradually in such a manner that doesn\u2019t affect the citizens,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Senate President Ahmed Lawan, who expressed concern over the issue of the subsidy removal, said hasty decision will affect the ordinary citizens.\n\nLawan, who begged the labour unions in the country not to go on strike, said \u201cthe issue of subsidy removal should be handled with utmost care.\n\n\u201cThis must involve proper planning, and appropriate timing such that the impact and consequences will not add to the hardship being faced by citizens,\u201d Lawan said of the subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake when the government said this is not the time for the removal, because subsidy has been abused and we must find a way to handle it so as to cushion the effect,\u201d Lawan said, even though he did not rule out the subsidy removal in the future.\n\nLawan, who insisted Nigerians should not suffer when the subsidy is eventually removed, expressed concern over the planned strike by the NLC and the Trade Union Congresses (TUC).\n\nThe Senate president, who appealed to the union leaders to sheathe their swords on the strike, said the government is working assiduously to ensure that citizens are taken care of when the subsidy is removed.\n\n\u201cWe are going to work together so that our people do not suffer but benefit\u201d, Lawan told the ministers and the NNPC GMD during the meeting.\n\nMinister of state for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, said the subsidy removal will take effect only if the National Assembly amends the law, especially the 2022 Budget.\n\n\u201cThe legislature should put in place laws that will ensure the smooth removal of fuel subsidy regime. We can\u2019t remove subsidy now. That is the stand of the government,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nOn his part, the GMD of the NNPC, Mele Kyari said the corporation will always fill the gap anytime it is asked to do so.\n\nFG Names Autogas As Alternative Fuel, Targets 1m Vehicles\u2019 Conversion\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has identified compressed natural gas, popularly known as Autogas, as an alternative to petrol and it plans to work with marketers to convert one million public vehicles from using petrol to autogas ahead of its plan to fully deregulate the downstream sector of the petroleum industry,\n\nThe government said the ultimate plan was to have at least one million vehicles converted in three years.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with marketers yesterday in Abuja, the minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, said government was looking at providing 50 percent funding for marketers to bring equipment from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for both vehicle conversion kits and petrol station conversion technologies.\n\nSylva said government wanted to have the CNG system running across the country to provide Nigerians with alternative fuel before petrol subsidy is removed some time in the future.\n\nHe told the marketers: \u201cToday I invited you here specially just to discuss one issue, the issues of the structures that we need to put in place before the removal of subsidy. We all agreed more than a year ago that before we deregulate, or going side by side with deregulation, we must provide an alternative fuel to our people.\n\n\u201cAnd the alternative we agreed upon was the autogas alternative to provide for our people. Since this agreement between us, a lot work has been going on and we have come to a stage where we need to take it further but we cannot move further without ensuring that you, as our partners, are fully on board,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe explained that for the project to move forward, there have to be a critical number of vehicles converted and a corresponding critical number of dispensing stations in place.\n\n\u201cIf not, you will have a situation where converted vehicles do not have places to refuel or you will have a situation where fuel stations do not have converted vehicles to fuel,\u201d he pointed out\n\nSylva, who admitted that after year the project was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja vehicle conversions have not been going on, said effort has been in putting in place the system for the conversion.\n\n\u201cWe have been talking to country OEMs and we have come to some arrangement with them. We have received commitments from the country OEMs that will give us half of what we require and the government will match them with the other half\u201d, he stated, adding that the OEMs need local partners to put the equipment in place in existing facilities across the country.\n\nAccording to him, the funding would come from the N250 billion provided by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nBut expressing reservations on the viability of the project, the marketers pointed out that the CNG system in Benin City, Edo State, owned by NIPCO Plc has not been profitable after many years in operation.\n\nThe immediate past chairman of Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Tunji Oyebani, explained that a lot needs to be done to bring investments in.\n\ne to invest\u201d, he pointed out.\n\nEarlier, the chairman of MOMAN, Olumide Adeosun disclosed that the group had working groups looking what was needed to partner with the government on the project.\n\nAdeosun noted that the financials around the project were a major issue including interest rate and gas availability from the supply side.\n\nClarifying some of the issues, the Technical Adviser on Gas Business to the Minister, Brenda Ataga said the government would pay 50 percent equity contributions to the export credit that the OEMs would provide.\n\nShe explained that the export credit loans would be at 2-4 percent with a payback period of five years.\n\nThe federal government had in December 2021 rolled out an autogas programme called the National Gas Expansion Programme.\n\nThe programme involves the conversion of fuel-powered cars, generators from petrol to gas. It is aimed at deepening domestic usage of natural gas in its various forms.\n\nAfter the launch, the government said that vehicle owners in the country will pay N250,000 to convert their cars to autogas.\n\nJustice Derefaka, Technical Adviser on Gas Business and Policy Implementation to Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, had explained that vehicle owners will have different payment plans to convert their cars to autogas.\n\n\u201cThe cost varies,\u201d Derefaka said during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily. \u201cSo, in terms of cost implication, it depends on the cylinder of the vehicle and, of course, for a typical SUV cylinder, it is a bit higher but on the average, it is around N200,000 to N250,000 and this is for a four-cylinder vehicle, but it becomes a little bit higher for a six-cylinder SUV vehicle.\u201d\n\nBuhari Not In Support Of Fuel Subsidy Removal \u2013 Petroleum Minister\n\nIn a related development, Timipre Sylva has said President Buhari is not in support of the removal of subsidy on the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol.\n\nRather, he explained that the Federal Government planned to complete consultations before coming out with a clear policy direction on the matter.\n\n\u201cI will tell you categorically that at this moment, the complete removal of subsidy is not on our plate at all,\u201d said Sylva during this week\u2019s edition of Channels Television\u2019s Newsnight.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is not in support of removing subsidy at this time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister of finance, budget, and national planning, Zainab Ahmed, had in November last year hinted that Nigeria would effect the complete removal of fuel subsidy in June 2022 and replace them with a N5000-a-month transportation grant to the poorest Nigerians.\n\nAmid mixed reactions over the issue, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, last Tuesday said President Buhari never directed the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nSylva, on his part, explained that the President\u2019s position in opposing fuel subsidy was predicated on its effect on citizens at the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nNLC Insists On Planned Jan; 27 Nationwide Protest\n\nNevertheless, the leadership of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has insisted that the planned nationwide protest over fuel subsidy removal, which is slated for 27th January, 2022, will still go on.\n\nThis is coming few days after 36 state governors under the aegis of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) resolved to engage the Congress on the proposed removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nIn a petition circular addressed to all state governors over the proposed hike of petrol price yesterday, the Congress said government must withdraw its plans to increase the pump price of petrol, adding that subsidy removal was a transfer of government failure to poor Nigerians.\n\nThe petition, which was jointly signed by the NLC national president, Comrade Ayuba Wabba and the secretary, Emanuel Ugboaja, maintained that federal government must re-engage organised labour in Nigeria to find mutually acceptable solutions to the \u201ccurrent quagmire\u201d in Nigeria\u2019s downstream petroleum sub-sector.\n\nPart of the petition read, \u201d Your excellency should use your position as a member of the National Economic Council to convey our foregoing persuasions and demands to the federal government. \u201d\n\nWe also warn that Nigerian workers would have no other choice than to down tools once the government goes ahead to force another round of petrol price increment on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe protest is only geared at alerting government on the sufferings that Nigerians are going through and the additional insufferable trauma that Nigerians would be subjected to if the government goes ahead with the hike in the price of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that the perennial increase of the pump price of petrol and other refined petroleum products by government is actually a transfer of government failure and inability to effectively govern to the poor masses of our country, central to this is the failure of government to manage Nigeria\u2019s four oil refineries and inability to build new ones,\u201d the petition added.\n\nSuspension Of Petrol Subsidy Removal Indication Of FG\u2019s People-oriented Govt \u2013 APC\n\nWeighing in on the matter, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has applauded the decision by the federal government to suspend the planned removal of subsidy on petroleum products, saying it shows the Buhari administration has the interest of Nigerians at heart.\n\nAccording to the governing party, \u201cthe federal government took into consideration the fact that the removal of subsidy at this time will heighten inflation and cause undue hardship on the citizenry.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by national secretary of its Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, APC noted that because programmes and policies of government are meant to benefit the people, \u201cif the timing of the planned subsidy removal would cause hardship on citizens, then a review was necessary.\u2019\n\nThe statement further noted: \u201cWe commend President Muhammadu Buhari for always putting the welfare and wellbeing of Nigerians first as he has serially displayed in the implementation of programmes and policies of this administration.\n\n\u201cIn line with the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the federal government is already putting in place measures, particularly boosting our local refining capacities, to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on expensive import of refined petroleum products. This will in due course usher in the eventual and full deregulation of the country\u2019s petroleum sector.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) said the intended increase in the pump price of petrol was ill-timed and insensitive to the appalling suffering, hardship and hunger that Nigerians are currently facing, occasioned by the harsh economic situation in the country.\n\nWhile addressing journalists in Abuja, the president of the NURTW, Tajudeen Ibikunle Baruwa said after the meeting of the National Administrative Council (NAC) of NURTW held in Abuja, the union agreed that any such increase at this critical period amounts to a direct attack on the already impoverished masses of the nation and will have spiraling effects on all other sectors of the economy.\n\nThe union also said the drivers who constitute their membership will be at the worst receiving end of such increase/subsidy removal and, without any monthly remunerations to fall back on, will be entirely left on their own to bear the brunt of such action.",
          "summary": "The federal government gave assurance that there will not be fuel subsidy removal until all mechanisms are put in place to cushion the effect.\nSince 2021, the NNPC has been paying for fuel subsidy by direct deduction from proceeds of crude oil sales.\nADVERTISEMENTThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have mobilise their members for a possible nationwide picketing if the government removes fuel subsidy.\n\u201cIssues around fuel subsidy removal came after the budget was passed.\n\u201cThe legislature should put in place laws that will ensure the smooth removal of fuel subsidy regime.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s power generation sub-sector is experiencing investment constraints following inability of distribution companies to take load as well as transmission inadequacies.\n\nManaging director of Ibom Power, Engr Meyen Etukudo, told energy journalists during an interview in Uyo that the firm is consolidating on its existing investment and also targeting construction of a 500 Mega Watts(MW) power plant in addition to its current 190MW.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that Ibom Power acquired its licence for 685MW which has been renewed till 2028.\n\nHe, however, said the GenCo like others, is facing enormous challenges following the inability of its host DisCo to take the quantum of power it generates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2018For instance, if I generate 100MW of electricity and the DisCo is only able to take 60MW, I send the remaining 40MW to the grid at the National Control Centre in Osogbo, Osun State. But if the Disco can take everything I generate, there is no point sending it to the grid,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lamented that the inability of the host DisCo and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to invest in infrastructure upgrade was a major setback to the state, saying, the Akwa Ibom state government has however taken up the responsibility of TCN by building 132/33KVA and 260MVA at Ikam which he said vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, commissioned in 2020.\n\nHe said this is a giant leap that was not been recorded anywhere in the country, saying the Akwa State Ibom government is the first to record such feat.\n\nHe said governor Emmanuel Udom, took the decision not to wait for the Federal Government through TCN to invest in the project because it would go a long way is solving the power supply challenges confronting industries in the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said the gesture by the State Government was also to ensure that the schools and hospitals also enjoy uninterrupted power supply, saying it remained regrettable that the State Government was doing all this alone without help from anywhere.\n\nIf the governor had all the powers, he said, he would have done far more to transform the electricity sector in the country.\n\nEtukudo added the 40 per cent stake of the Federal Government in the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company has prevented him from making the desired investment in that regard.\n\nAkwa Ibom, he said is blessed not to have had gas challenges, saying, the gas pipeline layed to Ibom Power is enough to take about 400 million standard cubic feet of gas (scuf) which is enough to take care of the phase two of the 500MW power plant.\n\nOn debt, he pointed out that the power plant since 2016 when he came on board has not been able to receive 30 per cent of its invoice to Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader(NBET).\n\nNBET indebtedness to Ibom Power runs into billions of Naira, he disclosed, adding that if it invoice N1 billion, it only gets about N300 million payment but since last year there has been improvement in the payment system.",

          "title": "Electoral Bill: With INEC\u2019s worry, Nigerians press NASS for harmonisation",
          "text": "As the National Assembly resumes plenary Tuesday, there are strong indications that both chambers would set up conference committee this week for harmonisation of amendments made on Section 84 of the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) 2021 Electoral Bill under consideration.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had refused assent to the Bill, citing limited choice on mode of primaries by political parties among other reasons.\n\nBut the two arms of the National Assembly will at plenary Tuesday set a harmonisation conference committee to resolve the logjam.\n\nThis is coming amidst rising concern by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Nigerians over the negative impact the delay could have on the conduct of the 2023 elections.\n\nINEC\u2019s worry\n\nFor instance, at a meeting with political parties, INEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu said the speedy passage of the Bill was \u201ccrucial to our preparations for future elections.\u201d\n\nYakubu also said he was optimistic of the commitment of both the Executive and the Legislature to getting the proposed law in place in good time.\n\n\u201cOn the Electoral Amendment Bill currently before the National Assembly, the Commission is encouraged by the Senate President\u2019s assurance to give priority attention to the bill when the National Assembly reconvenes from its recess today, and the commitment by the President to assent to the Bill as soon as the issue of mode of primaries by political parties is resolved.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to a speedy passage of the bill, which is crucial to our preparations for future elections. As soon as it is signed into law, the commission will quickly release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election based on the new law,\u201d the INEC boss had said.\n\nAccordingly, on resumption last week, both the Senate and the House of Representatives, expunged Clause 87(2) which contained the provisions and replaced it with Clause 84 which widened the options.\n\nBut while the Senate in clause 84 , makes provision for three options of Direct , Indirect and Consensus as possible mode of primary elections political parties can use in electing their candidates for general elections , the House of Representatives\u2019 version limited the options to Direct and Indirect primaries.\n\nConference c\u2019ttee\n\nIn getting the re-amended bill transmitted to President Buhari for assent within available time frame ahead of the 2023 general elections, the lawmakers told Blueprint that conference committees will be raised at both Chambers this week for the required harmonisation of positions.\n\nLeader of the Senate Yahaya Abdullahi made the position known in a telephone conversation Monday.\n\nHe said the laid down parliamentary procedures would be followed in harmonising amendments made by both chambers on mode of primaries for political parties as contained in section 84.\n\n\u201d The most importantly thing has been done by providing required options as far as party primaries are concerned as observed by Mr President in the letter of refusal of assent on the bill.\n\n\u201cWhile the Senate came up with three options, the House of Representatives recommended two. These obviously require conference committees to be set up at both Chambers in due course for harmonisation of amendments made, final adoption by both chambers and speedy transmission of the Bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the amendment which included consensus as one of the options of primary election for political parties, may be finally adopted by both chambers since is provided for in the Constitution of many of the political parties and even mentioned by President Buhari during media chats on some television stations early in the month.\n\nNigerians clamour\n\nAnd against this backdrop, Nigerians have called on the National Assembly to quickly harmonise and reach a common ground on the contentious issues in the Bill.\n\nThey also demanded that any clause that may give President Buhari another excuse to refuse assent to the Bill should be avoided.\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint, a civil society leader on the platform of Good Governance Initiatives (GGI), Comfort Oloyede, said: \u201cWith less than 12 months to the general elections, INEC needs to know the direction to follow so as to begin preparations in earnest for the election.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to leave loopholes that politicians might explore to render the 2023 elections invalid.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to shelve personal aggrandizement and work in the overall interest of the nation. Nigerians expect the national assembly to quickly harmonise and reach a common ground on the contentious issues in the electoral amendment bill currently before the legislators.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a civil servant, Avoku Lawani, said: \u201cWe cannot continue to wait as the efforts and resources put into it might come to naught. They should be encouraged to pass it into law. And if need be, they should veto Mr President if he refuses to give assent. We should be dealing with other areas of our elections that might throw up new challenges and not wasting time on things that we ought to have forgotten since.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that there might not be free and credible poll because lots of candidates will go to court to challenge the provisions they feel prevent them from winning. And that could cast negative shadow on the Commission. So, they should be focused on addressing the controversial clause in the bill.\u201d\n\nAnother respondent who is an Abuja-based businessman, Alhaji Adamu Bala, said: \u201cFor me, I will suggest that they handle the issue in such a way that Nigerians will be satisfied with their handling of the matter that touches directly on Electronic Transmission and speedy passage of the amendment clause awaiting assent by President. Those areas are too germane to be allowed to suffer untold hardship. The earlier he signs the Bill into law the better for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nYaiaga Africa, IPC\n\nAlso, Director of Programmes Yiaga Africa Cynthia Mbamalu urged the lawmakers to look into the critical issues with respect to the Electoral Bill 2021 as a matter of urgency.\n\nShe said the first is the need for the immediate constitution of the harmonisation conference committee to harmonise the proposed amendment, especially as it relates to clause 84 on the mode of party primaries.\n\nShe said the second is the need for the harmonisation committee to adopt the amendment providing either direct or indirect primaries as the only mode of party primaries in line with the House of Representative\u2019s review of clause 84.\n\n\u201cWe are already running out of time with respect to the passage of the Electoral Bill into Law for full implementation and enforcement ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to have the new Electoral Act operative from the end of January 2022 ahead of the Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, to give INEC, stakeholders and citizens the opportunity to test the new Act, integrate its implementation and ensure proper familiarisation of the new provisions of the Act ahead of the general elections.\n\n\u201cA further delay on this process poses grave threat to the credibility of the 2023 general elections and will be detrimental to citizens\u2019 confidence in the electoral process and trust in this government.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should conclude its process and re-transmit the Bill to the President for assent. Nigerians are watching and waiting. We are running out of time,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, Director International Press Centre Lanre Arogundade said they should just have the harmonisation conference and proceed to clean up the bill for immediate re-transmission to the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is no longer and ordinary race against time but a very fast one at that. The process of the NASS sending the bill back to the President and him asserting must be concluded by the end of this month.\u201d",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari had refused assent to the Bill, citing limited choice on mode of primaries by political parties among other reasons.\nThis is coming amidst rising concern by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Nigerians over the negative impact the delay could have on the conduct of the 2023 elections.\n\u201cWe look forward to a speedy passage of the bill, which is crucial to our preparations for future elections.\nHe said the laid down parliamentary procedures would be followed in harmonising amendments made by both chambers on mode of primaries for political parties as contained in section 84.\n\u201cWe are already running out of time with respect to the passage of the Electoral Bill into Law for full implementation and enforcement ahead of the 2023 elections.",

          "text": "The military in Burkina Faso says it has seized power and overthrown President Roch Kabor\u00e9.\n\nThe announcement was made on state television by an army officer, who cited the deteriorating security situation for the military takeover.\n\nMr Kabor\u00e9 had faced growing discontent over his failure to stem an Islamist insurgency.\n\nHis whereabouts are unclear, but the officer said that all those detained were in a secure location.\n\nThe coup comes a day after troops seized barracks, and gunshots were heard in the capital, Ouagadougou.\n\nEarlier, the ruling People\u2019s Movement for Progress (PMP) party said that both Mr Kabor\u00e9 and a government minister had survived an assassination attempt.\n\nOn Sunday, mutinying troops demanded the sacking of military chiefs and more resources to fight militants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda.\n\nThe army statement said Mr Kabor\u00e9 had failed to unite the nation and to deal effectively with the security crisis which \u201cthreatens the very foundations of our nation\u201d.\n\nThe statement was issued in the name of a group not heard of previously, the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration or MPSR, its French acronym.\n\nAlthough read out by another officer, the statement was signed by Lt-Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who is believed to be the coup leader and a senior commander with years of experience fighting the Islamist militants.\n\nThe statement said that parliament and the government had been dissolved, and the constitution suspended, but promised a \u201creturn to constitutional order\u201d within a \u201creasonable time\u201d.\n\nThe military also announced the closure of Burkina Faso\u2019s borders.\n\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the coup and called on the military to \u201censure the protection and the physical integrity\u201d of Mr Kabor\u00e9.\n\nThe African Union and regional bloc, Ecowas, have also condemned the forceful takeover of power, with Ecowas saying it holds the soldiers responsible for the deposed president\u2019s well-being.\n\nEarlier, the news of his detention was received with cheers and celebrations in Ouagadougou, reports the BBC\u2019s senior Africa correspondent Anne Soy.\n\nMr Kabor\u00e9 has not been seen in public since the crisis began, but two posts appeared on his Twitter account before the officer announced he had been toppled.\n\nThe later one called on those who had taken up arms to lay them down \u201cin the higher interest of the nation\u201d. Earlier, Mr Kabor\u00e9 congratulated the national football team on their win in an Africa Cup of Nations match.\n\nIt is unclear who posted the tweets.\n\nSome security sources say the president and other government ministers are being held at the Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana barracks in the capital.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people came out in support of the soldiers and some of them set fire to the ruling party\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe coup comes a week after 11 soldiers were arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow Mr Kabor\u00e9.\n\nBut discontent has been growing in Burkina Faso over the government\u2019s failure to defeat an Islamist insurgency in the country since 2015.\n\nThat escalated in November, when 53 people, mainly members of the security forces, were killed by suspected jihadists. And on Saturday, a banned rally to protest against the government\u2019s perceived failure led to dozens of arrests.\n\nMutinying soldiers made several demands, including: the removal of the army\u2019s chief of staff and the head of the intelligence service; more troops to be deployed to the front line; and better conditions for the wounded and soldiers\u2019 families.\n\nSimilar troubles in neighbouring Mali led to a military coup in May 2021 \u2013 one that was broadly welcomed by the public.\n\nBurkina Faso is now the third West African country to witness a military takeover in recent years. Guinea and Mali have had sanctions imposed on them by Ecowas to press them to return to constitutional order.",

          "text": "At least one person died of complications related to COVID-19 on the average last week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.\n\nWHO Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, stated this on Monday in his opening remarks at the 150th session of the global agency\u2019s Executive Board in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nHe informed the session that it was already two years since WHO declared COVID-19 a global health emergency.\n\n\u201cThis Sunday marks two years since I declared a public health emergency of international concern \u2013 the highest level of alarm under international law \u2013 over the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Ghebreyesus. \u201cAt the time, there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths reported outside China.\n\n\u201cTwo years later, almost 350 million cases have been reported, and more than 5.5 million deaths \u2013 and we know these numbers are an underestimate. On average last week, 100 cases were reported every three seconds, and somebody lost their life to COVID-19 every 12 seconds.\n\n\u201cSince Omicron was first identified just nine weeks ago, more than 80 million cases have been reported to WHO \u2013 more than were reported in the whole of 2020. So far, the explosion in cases has not been matched by a surge in deaths, although deaths are increasing in all regions, especially in Africa, the region with the least access to vaccines.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NCDC Confirms 228 COVID-19 Cases In 13 States, FCT\n\nAccording to the WHO chief, the questions many are asking include where the world stands as it relates to COVID-19, where it\u2019s headed, and when the pandemic will.\n\nHe admitted that people would live with COVID-19 for the foreseeable future and would need to learn to manage it through a sustained and integrated system for acute respiratory diseases, which would provide a platform for preparedness for future pandemics.\n\n\u2018Everyone Is Tired\u2019\n\nGhebreyesus, however, believes learning to live with the virus cannot mean giving it a free ride or accepting almost 50 thousand deaths a week from a preventable and treatable disease.\n\nHe added that such a situation does not amount to succumbing to an unacceptable burden on health systems, especially when exhausted health workers go once again to the front line daily.\n\nThe WHO chief explained that there were different scenarios for how the pandemic could play out, and how the acute phase could end, warning that to assume Omicron would be the last variant would be dangerous.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, globally the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge. To change the course of the pandemic, we must change the conditions that are driving it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that everyone is tired of this pandemic; that people are tired of restrictions on their movement, travel, and other freedoms; that economies and businesses are hurting; and that many governments are walking a tightrope, attempting to balance what is effective with what is acceptable to their people.\u201d\n\nOn the vaccination drive, Ghebreyesus revealed that 86 member states could not reach last year\u2019s target of vaccinating 40 per cent of their populations.\n\nHe stated that 34 member states, most of them in Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region, have not been able to vaccinate even 10 per of their populations while 85 per cent of the population of Africa has yet to receive a single dose of vaccine.\n\n\u201cJust a week ago, COVAX delivered its one billionth dose,\u201d the WHO chief hinted. \u201cIn the past 10 weeks, COVAX shipped more vaccines than in the previous 10 months combined.\n\n\u201cThe challenges of supply we have faced in the past year are now being replaced by the challenge of rolling out vaccines as fast and far as possible. WHO and our partners are working with countries around the clock to overcome these challenges.\u201d",

The infant was \u201cimmediately extracted and taken to Yaounde General Hospital\u201d and is in a \u201cmedically stable\u201d condition, it added.\n\nThe tragedy happened at gates where final ticket checks are supposed to take place.\n\nOne man in his 30s who was caught up in the crush told AFP that it was \u201ccomplete chaos\u201d at the entrance to the stadium as supporters without tickets tried to force their way in.\n\n\u201cI arrived a quarter of an hour before kick-off. I had my ticket, but all of a sudden a group of people without tickets arrived and tried to force their way through and we found ourselves pushed up against the fences,\u201d said the supporter, who gave his name as Stephane.\n\n\u201cI was crushed up against a woman who said she couldn\u2019t breathe. Eventually the gate gave in and I was able to get through, but it was complete chaos.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Crisis meeting\u2019 \u2013\n\nPresident Biya has \u201cordered the opening of an investigation so that all light is shed on this tragic incident,\u201d the communications minister said.\n\nThe Confederation of African Football (CAF), which runs the continent\u2019s flagship competition, said it was \u201cinvestigating the situation and trying to get more details on what transpired\u201d.\n\nIt added it was in \u201cconstant communication with Cameroon government and the Local Organizing Committee\u201d.\n\nCameroon\u2019s health minister Manaouda Malachie tweeted images showing him visiting a hospital treating those injured in the incident.\n\n\u201cEverything is done to give them free care and the best support,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nCAF was due to hold a \u201ccrisis meeting\u201d with the organising committee on Tuesday, dedicated exclusively to security issues in the stadiums, a source close to African football\u2019s governing body told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Deadly crowding \u2013\n\nThe government, Sadi said, is \u201conce more appealing to Cameroonians\u2019 sense of responsibility, discipline and civic duty for the total success of this great sporting event.\u201d\n\nCameroon was initially meant to host the Cup of Nations in 2019, but the event was moved to Egypt over concerns the country\u2019s stadiums were not ready.\n\nCAF cited delays in the construction of stadiums and infrastructure projects, as well as question marks over security.\n\nOvercrowding at football matches around the world has resulted in scores of deaths.\n\nThousands of fans in the Egyptian capital Cairo in 2015 attempted to enter a stadium to watch a game, triggering panic as police fired tear gas and birdshot, resulting in 19 dead.\n\nIn April 2001, 43 people died in a stampede at Johannesburg\u2019s Ellis Park stadium during a game between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs.\n\nIn chaotic scenes at last year\u2019s European Championship final between England and Italy in London, some 2,000 ticketless fans were found to have gained access to Wembley Stadium, with an independent review later finding that a tragedy was only narrowly averted.\n\nOn the pitch on Monday, Cameroon sealed their place in the last eight of the tournament with a 2-1 win and will now play Gambia in the quarter-finals.\n\nThat match is due to be played on Saturday in Cameroon\u2019s economic capital Douala, although there had been speculation that remaining matches scheduled to be played there could be moved to Yaounde due to concerns about the state of the pitch.",

          "text": "Boris Johnson is under renewed pressure after Downing Street admitted staff gathered inside No 10 during the first Covid lockdown to mark his birthday.\n\nITV News reported that up to 30 people attended the June 2020 event, sang Happy Birthday and were served cake.\n\nNo 10 said staff had \u201cgathered briefly\u201d to \u201cwish the prime minister a happy birthday\u201d, adding that he had been there \u201cfor less than 10 minutes\u201d.\n\nBut a number of MPs have expressed criticism over this latest revelation.\n\nRules at the time \u2013 19 June 2020 \u2013 banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people.\n\nITV News said the birthday event had taken place in the Cabinet Room just after 14:00 BST that day, adding that it had been arranged as a surprise for Mr Johnson by his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, after he returned from an official trip to a school in Hertfordshire.\n\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice denied ITV\u2019s claim that 30 people had gathered in the Cabinet Room, saying the number of staff present was \u201ccloser to 10\u201d and it \u201cwas literally just a birthday cake brought in at the end of the day\u201d.\n\nThe BBC has learned that Sue Gray, the senior civil servant compiling a report into gatherings on government premises during Covid restrictions, already knew about the 19 June event.\n\nHer findings are expected to be published later this week.\n\nBut in the meantime, a number of MPs have denounced the latest revelation.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Mr Johnson should reflect on his ability to live by the rules he made himself.\n\nHe accused the PM of breaching the trust of the British people and called for him to resign.\n\nFormer Conservative Party chair Baroness Warsi told the BBC News Channel it was time for Mr Johnson to \u201cthink long and hard about what is in the best interest of this country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe question he should be asking himself every morning is, \u2018Is me staying in office allowing me to run this office in a way in which is making the country better, or am I a distraction?'\u201d she added.\n\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen told Newsnight that the revelations of a gathering at No 10 to celebrate the prime minister\u2019s birthday during the first coronavirus lockdown, \u201ccould well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d.\n\nIn a tweet, the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davison revealed that her partner also has a birthday on 19 June but added: \u201cWe marked it in 2020 by inviting one other household to sit outside, socially distanced, in our garden.\u201d\n\nAnd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his call for Boris Johnson to stand down, saying: \u201cThe prime minister is a national distraction and he\u2019s got to go\u201d.\n\nBut the PM did receive some support from Cabinet colleagues.\n\nCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries said in a tweet: \u201cSo, when people in an office buy a cake in the middle of the afternoon for someone else they are working in the office with and stop for 10 minutes to sing happy birthday and then go back to their desks, this is now called a party?\u201d\n\nThe fact that Mr Johnson had been publicly presented with a birthday cake during the school visit a few hours earlier provides all of Wednesday\u2019s newspapers with a picture of the prime minister for many of them to use on their front pages \u2013 even if it is not of the cake in question.\n\nSome Tory MPs, including the party\u2019s Scottish leader Douglas Ross, have also called on Mr Johnson to go, but many more say they are waiting for Ms Gray\u2019s findings before making a judgement.\n\nAt total of 54 MPs must write to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, declaring no confidence in the PM, to trigger a leadership contest.\n\nJo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the Downing Street birthday gathering \u201cwas the day before what would have been my dad\u2019s 73rd birthday, shortly after he had passed away from Covid-19.\n\n\u201cIt was a horrible time for my family, but we stuck to the rules, not even being able to hug to comfort each other.\u201d\n\nShe added it was \u201ccompletely sickening\u201d that No 10 staff had gathered indoors to eat cake for the PM\u2019s birthday, saying: \u201cWhile dozens sang Happy Birthday to him, families couldn\u2019t even sing in memory at their loved ones\u2019 funerals.\u201d",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has said there is \u201ctotal unanimity\u201d with European leaders over Russia\u2019s troop build-up on the border with Ukraine.\n\nDuring crisis talks on Monday, Western powers agreed to \u201cswift\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions against Russia if it were to invade.\n\nThe US has also put 8,500 thousands of troops on alert.\n\nRussia denies plans of an incursion, despite deploying some 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine\u2019s border.\n\nJoining the US and UK on the call were the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the EU. The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg also dialled in.\n\n\u201cI had a very, very, very good meeting \u2013 total unanimity with all the European leaders,\u201d Mr Biden said afterwards.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the leaders \u201cagreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility\u201d.\n\nShould a further Russian incursion into Ukraine happen, they agreed that \u201callies must enact swift retributive responses including an unprecedented package of sanctions\u201d.\n\nThe aim of the 80-minute video call between the allies was to agree on a common strategy against Russia\u2019s actions, after some disagreements over how Western nations were responding.\n\nOn Monday, UK PM Boris Johnson warned that \u201cgloomy\u201d intelligence suggests Russia is planning a lightning raid on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the UK started withdrawing some staff from its embassy there.\n\nThe US took a similar move, by ordering relatives of its embassy staff to leave.\n\nBut EU staff are to stay in place for now, with foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying he would not \u201cdramatise\u201d the tensions.\n\nThere have also been differences on the support given to Ukraine \u2013 the US and UK are among the nations to have sent military aid. However Germany refused Ukraine\u2019s request for defensive weapons, and will instead send medical aid, German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told local media.\n\nThe Pentagon has said some 8,500 combat-ready US troops are on alert to deploy at short notice.\n\nBut they would only be deployed if the Nato military alliance decides to activate a rapid-reaction force, \u201cor if other situations develop\u201d, said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.\n\nThere are no plans to deploy to Ukraine itself, he added.\n\nSome Nato members, including Denmark, Spain, France and the Netherlands, are already planning to send fighter jets and warships to eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region.\n\nOver the weekend, some 90 tonnes of US \u201clethal aid\u201d including ammunition for \u201cfront-line defenders\u201d arrived in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin has said it sees Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that the alliance will not expand further east, including into neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion.\n\nFor months now, the Ukrainians have been preparing a territorial defence force of volunteers. They are training for a possible defence of Kyiv.\n\nOne woman member, Marta Yuzkiv, a doctor in her 50s, told the BBC: \u201cOf course I am worried. I am a peaceful woman, I don\u2019t want to have a war started. But in any case, in case it\u2019s started, I should be ready to defend the country.\u201d\n\nAndrei Volkov, an IT consultant in Kyiv, called the situation \u201cdangerous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe situation is extremely tense, I think something might happen,\u201d he said, adding that he was making \u201ccontingency plans\u201d.\n\n\u201cGoing to western Ukraine I suppose, going somewhere where it\u2019s going to be safe.\u201d\n\nRussia has seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal.\n\nRussian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia\u2019s borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.",
