          "text": "The junta which seized power in the West African state of Guinea has unveiled a \u201ctransitional charter\u201d that it says will steer the country back to civilian rule.\n\nThe document, read out on national television late Monday, sets down a series of tasks, including the drafting of a new constitution and holding \u201cfree, democratic and transparent\u201d elections, although it does not spell out how long the transition will last.\n\nTroops led by a special forces colonel, Mamady Doumbouya, on September 5 arrested 83-year-old President Alpha Conde, who had been battling a wave of unpopularity.\n\nConde became Guinea\u2019s first democratically elected president in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015.\n\nBut last year he pushed through a controversial new constitution that allowed him to run for a third term in October 2020.\n\nThe move sparked mass demonstrations in which dozens of protesters were killed. Conde won re-election but the political opposition maintained the poll was a sham.\n\nThe new charter identifies four institutions or figures that will be in charge of the transition.\n\nThey are the National Rallying Committee for Development (CNRD) set up by the junta and headed by Doumbaya; the president of the transition, who will also serve as the head of the CNRD, head of state and armed forces chief; a government headed by a civilian prime minister; and a legislative body called the National Transition Council or CNT.\n\nNo member of these institutions will be allowed to take part \u201cin either national or local elections, which will be organised at the end of the transition period.\u201d\n\nThe duration of the transition \u201cwill be set down by joint agreement among the living forces of the nation\u201d and the CNRD, according to the charter.\n\nGuinea\u2019s neighbours in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are deeply worried by the turbulence in Guinea, one of the poorest and most volatile countries in Africa.\n\nThe putsch is the second to take place in their region, after Mali, in less than 13 months.\n\nThe bloc is demanding that elections be held within six months.\n\nThe CNT, comprising 81 members drawn from political parties, civil society, trade unions, employers, the security forces and other bodies, will be tasked with drawing up the new constitution.\n\nNo members of Conde\u2019s government or the institutions of the former regime can be named to it.\n\n(AFP)",

          "title": "Senate, UN call for public support for Gender & Equal Opportunities Bill",
          "text": "By Victoria Ojeme\n\nThe Nigerian Senate, UNWomen and other development partners have called for widespread support for the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill before the National Assembly.\n\nThe law in Nigeria has provided women and girls legal claims to demand freedom from violence, discrimination or abuse on the basis of gender. However, the full enjoyment of their human rights remains elusive as they continue to face extensive discrimination that violate the principle of equality of rights.\n\nHere are the facts: Nigeria globally sits within the 0.1 \u2013 4.9 % range for women\u2019s representation in government and it is at the bottom of the whole African continent in terms of representation of women into elective offices.\n\nGirls account for 60% of Nigeria\u2019s more than 10 million out-of-school children, facing barriers such as child marriage, poverty, and discriminatory social norms.\n\nStartling as this data may be, the true scale of the problem of poverty in Nigeria only becomes more apparent when you consider the fact that women, who make up slightly less than 50% of Nigeria\u2019s population, account for more than 70% of those in extreme poverty.\n\nHence, poverty is a gender issue. So too are the massive inequalities spiraling out of control \u2013 across wealth, health and every other socio-political determinant in Nigeria. Recognising the centrality of gender to these issues is not only critical to fully appreciating the scale of the challenges, it is the most effective route to achieving shared progress and prosperity in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nAll these informed today\u2019s stakeholders meeting on the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill (GEOB), which is championed by the senator representing Ekiti South Senatorial District, \u2018Biodun Olujimi.\n\nShe said that the purpose for the meeting was to discuss the \u201cGender and Equal Opportunities Bill (GEOB), the proposed legislation which we have been working on, for several years to bridge the gender inequality in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bill has passed through several reviews and with the technical assistance of our partners, UNWomen and our Civil Society, we have arrived at our present stage,\u201d the Senator said.\n\nShe reiterateted that the Bill is development-oriented and includes provisions which will promote equal access for women and men for instance across all sectors.\n\nThe Bill also has key provisions such as the adoption of temporary special measures to eliminate discrimination of women and widen the space for women to occupy leadership positions in politics and public office. It also seeks to address several forms of discrimination against women such as land ownership, inheritance, education, employment, and sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cThe Bill has had a very long journey, and during this period, it has faced much resistance and criticism along the way. This may be put down to the lack of awareness and misunderstanding/ misinterpretation about its aims and goals amongst other reasons,\u201d she said.\n\nOn her part, Ms. Comfort Lamptey, UN Women Representative to Nigeria and ECOWAS said the Passage of the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill provides an invaluable window of opportunity to implement legal frameworks to address gender inequalities and prevent, protect, and redress gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cOver the past 18 months or so, we have witness how COVID has exposed preexisting gender inequalities in countries across the world. Here in Nigeria for example, the cases of gender-based violence skyrocketed during the lockdown period. Data from March to April indicate a five-fold increase in cases across 23 States \u2013 causing the President to declare a State of Emergency on GBV.\n\n\u201cIn the political realm, we all recall the high aspirations of women who vied for political office in the 2019 general elections. The highest ever number of women seeking political office. Yet, the result of the elections saw a regression in the number of women elected to political office. In fact, women\u2019s representation in Nigeria has been on a steady decline since Nigeria\u2019s return to democracy in 1999,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking also, the Australian High Commissioner to Nigeria, John Donnelly said \u201cGender equality and women\u2019s empowerment is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do.\u201d He explained that the economic and development benefits are clear as protecting women and girls, investing in their rights, and providing opportunities for them to prosper benefits not only their communities, but the whole country.\n\n\u201cWe at the Australian High Commission have recognised this, with targeted funding in Nigeria through our Direct Aid Program. Separate from our support for UN Women\u2019s work on the GEOB, we have also funded through the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism the production of a handbook for journalists on reporting on gender-based violence,\u201d he said.",

Our finding is that no such decision was taken at any meeting or organ of the party. Maybe, the Caretaker Chairman was merely expressing his personal opinion on the matter and not necessarily the official position of the party.\n\n\u201cWe, the members of the Youth Congress reiterate our position that it will be wrong for the PDP to zone the Governorship position to two zones in the state, namely, the Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central Senatorial zones without considering the fate of Ebonyi South Senatorial district. There is nothing like Abakaliki Block or Afikpo Block.\n\n\u201cThe two blocks existed momentarily after Ebonyi state was created in 1996. On the creation of Ebonyi state, the Abakaliki block had six LGAs while the Afikpo block had four LGAs. Shortly afterwards, three new LGAs, namely Ebonyi, Ezza North and Ivo were created and the state was split into three Senatorial Zones. Anybody talking of two blocks of Abakaliki and Afikpo now is introducing sectionalism into the state.\n\n\u201cSince 1996, the politics of the state has been based on Zoning in the three Senatorial districts. We urge our leaders and Ebonyi people, in general, to be vigilant at all times and not to allow agents of confusion to destroy the state by resorting to archaic zoning formulae.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the Governorship slot should be thrown open to the three Senatorial districts or we go back to Ebonyi North where the zoning started in 1999.\n\n\u201cThe PDP in Ebonyi state should adopt all measures that would bring all parts of the state together, to ensure unity, justice and equity in the state.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Prof. Emmanuel Aluyor, as a model for others to follow.\n\n\u201cHe stated: \u2018The focus has to do with providing quality education to Nigerians and indeed Africans, in conformity with the clear-cut mandate given by the Edo State Government\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe added, \u2018For us, quality has to do with doing things in good time; we are committed to making sure that students graduate in good time.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe world-class institution has an enviable clinical skills laboratory that competes favourably with what is obtainable in standard medical schools across the globe.\n\n\u201cEdo State University Uzairue boasts of being the first medical training institution in Nigeria with an Anatomage table; an Anatomage table is the most advanced technological tool used in the training of medical students in the field of anatomy. \u201cThe university also has a conducive temperature-controlled classroom for teaching and learning, well-equipped laboratories, state-of-the-art Mass Communication Radio and Television Studios.\n\n\u201cThe new academic session will commence with the resumption of old students on the 17th of October,2021, while successful students from the Post-UTME Screening Exercise scheduled to hold on 14th October 2021, are slated to resume on Sunday, 7th November 2021\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 3rd convocation ceremony of the university is scheduled to hold on Thursday, 4th November 2021, while the Convocation Lecture will hold on Wednesday, 3rd November 2021\u201d.",

Akpodoro, who was appointed the Chairman to the Board of Trustee, BoT of the group emphasised the need by Phase 3 ex-agitators to keep and maintain peaceful disposition at all times as he vowed to double his efforts at repositioning and setting the group on the path of progress capable of thrusting it to the limelight and ensure that members are developed into imbibing better understanding of who they are and thereby cut down on misdemeanours of errant members of across phases particularly phase 3.\n\nMembers of the inaugurated executives are: Eshanekpe Israel as BoT Chairman; Figbele Joseph as Chairman; Solo Adu, Vice Chairman; Idiami, Special Adviser and Abraham Ekokotu emerged as Secretary.\n\nWhile Eddy emerged as the Public Relations Officer 2; Moses (Mobilization Officer; Collins Arigo is the Spokesman; Keleye Monday emerged as the Treasurer just as Onos Diyo was appointed the Financial Secretary.\n\nOther officers that were filled included: the Public Relations Officer 1 with Kingsley Agas; Julius Omoyibo emerged Assistant Secretary; Odjokpa Jacob (Social Organizer); Gen. Raymond is the Protocol Officer while Okogbe Edwin is an Ex-Officio member; Comr. Austine Omokpe is the Media Officer and Fada Fada emerged as the Special Adviser.\n\nOther ex-agitators at the event are Charles Akatakpo, Okoro Godwin, Festus Ogolo, Daniel America, Obus Johnson, Onoriode Diyo, One law Lucky and Bright Ejiro Okpako.\n\nAlso in attendance were; Okogbe Edwin a.k.a Ibori; Awareness Olurehe; Feco Philip; Steve Bawharhe and Esedede Israel Orievwen.",

He has done it several times. I think this one got the attention of everybody because the people wanted him to resume work immediately after his father\u2019s burial,\u201d a source in the know told our correspondent.\n\nMeanwhile, Ogun residents have expressed displeasure over the development, describing it as a total breach of the constitution.\n\nA lawyer, Festus Ogun, posited that while the state was \u201con fire\u201d, the trio travelled to London, abdicating their duties.\n\nFestus Ogun described the situation as a constitutional infraction, which he threatened would be challenged.\n\n\u201cDapo Abiodun is in London. His deputy is in London. Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly is in the US. Ogun State is on fire, but the key leaderships are cooling off abroad. Abdicating duties. This is a constitutional infraction that will be challenged,\u201d Festus Ogun said.\n\nThe Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun, Sikirulahi Ogundele, said that he was not surprised by the actions of the three most senior government officials in Ogun, saying, \u201cthey don\u2019t have a direction, since they are visionless.\u201d\n\nOgundele asked the governor and others to return to Ogun in order to mark the annual October 1 independence day celebration on Friday.\n\nDAILY POST reports that there are rumours spreading on social media that the Deputy Governor had left the country angrily when the Governor allegedly ignored her and handed over to the SSG.\n\nBut, the State Commissioner for Information, Waheed Odusile, debunked the rumour.\n\nOdusile lambasted journalists, accusing them of putting \u201crubbish\u201d together in the name of journalism.\n\n\u201cThat (the Deputy Governor left the country because the Governor handed over to the SSG) is not true. You people should not insinuate what is not there. I\u2019ve been seeing the stupid things other people are writing. As journalists, can\u2019t we even reason or just use our brains for once? Just look at it, people will just sit down somewhere, put rubbish together and call it stories. Is that journalism?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for the past 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen this type of reportage in my life. People just cook up stories for whatever reasons and they believe they are doing journalism. The report is not true please,\u201d Odusile reacted furiously.\n\nWhen he was speaking on the absence of the Governor and his Deputy same time, Odusile said: \u201cGovernment is running, somebody is there. If they (Abiodun and Salako-Oyedele) are not around, somebody will do the job, and the job is being done by somebody who is designated to do it.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t do everything or please everyone \u2013 Gov Abiodun",

Your job is a selfless one and I salute your courage.\u201d\n\nThe traditional ruler, who is a grand patron of Bauchi NUJ, said though journalists had been doing a lot, there was the need for them to add advocacy to their responsibility to the society.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ci=In this period of insecurity and uncertainty, you have remained committed and dogged in your reportage of the situation. This is very encouraging. You can do more by adding advocacy to what you are doing.\u201d\n\nHe, however, emphasised the need for journalists to report events accurately and always endeavour to tell the public the truth always as well as be fair, courteous, objective and professional in their reportage.\n\n\u201cYou have to be fearless, courteous, courageous, objective and professional as you do what is expected of you. Society relies on you for accurate information,\u201d Alhaji Othman admonished.\n\nWhile briefing the Emir earlier, the Chairman of Bauchi State Council of NUJ, Comrade Umar Sa\u2019idu, said that the Press Week was organised by the Union with a view to affording members the opportunity of self-assessment for them to know what was needed of them to do to remain on course and focused.\n\nThe chairman informed the U=union\u2019s grand patron that part of the activities lined up for the week was recognition of outstanding members who would be honoured in order to serve as a morale booster to them and encouragement for others to do better in the course of their duty.\n\nHe then commended the Emir of Dass for his fatherly role to members of the union, declaring that, \u201cNUJ has always enjoyed your",

          "text": "From Sola Ojo\n\nNorthern States Governors\u2019 Forum, yesterday, rose from its one-day emergency meeting with the Northern States Traditional Council Chairmen in Kaduna and vehemently rejected calls that the Presidency be zoned to the South in 2023.\n\nSouthern governors have repeatedly insisted that power must shift to their region.\n\nHowever, Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Bako Lalong in an 11-point resolution of the meeting said the position of their southern counterpart was \u201cunacceptable\u201d as there was no constitutional provision on power rotation.\n\nLalong said though some Northern governors have earlier spoken in favour of the rotational presidency, the action of the southern top politicians were counter-productive, especially as it negates the position of the constitution.\n\nIThe group also tasked the Federal Government to expedite action on National Livestock Transformation Programme as a springboard in transiting from the open grazing system as widely practised in the North\n\nOn the ongoing debate on the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), the forum claimed it was constrained because the matter was in court, but, went ahead to present the position of those who attended the meeting.\n\nThe communique read in full: \u201cThe Forum reviewed security updates from the region and observed the need for a sustained synergy and coordinated efforts between the federal and northern states governments while noting success of recent measures. The meeting also noted with concern the constraint of the security services and urged the armed forces to embark on simultaneous operations and resolved to share the plans of the Frontline States come up with common with other Region; and assured of its readiness to work in synergy with the Federal Government of Nigeria in finding lasting solution to the current security challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Forum appreciated the ongoing onslaught against banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram, especially in the North East and parts of North West and North Central states and encouraged the armed forces and other security agencies to sustain the tempo to enable the security challenges be permanently addressed in the shortest time.\n\n\u201cThe Forum received updates on the Renewable / Solar Energy Project and NOTED that request for land for the project had been submitted and are being processed by the Northern States. The Committee had commenced negotiations in a public private arrangement and sovereign guarantees to ensure bankability of the project by multilateral financial organizations. The Forum called on States yet to process the request for allocation of land for the project to expedite action.\n\n\u201cThe meeting received updates on activities of some Committees constituted by the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum and NOTED that recommendations contained therein are being considered with a view to coming up with implementation strategies.\n\n\u201cThe Forum observed that some Northern States Governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three Geo-Political Zone in the South with a view to promoting unity and peace in the Nation. Notwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemn the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South. The statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected President shall:- score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation. In the case of run-up simple majority win the election.\n\n\u201cThe Northern State Governors Forum considered the on-going National debate on the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT). As responsible leaders while we are constraint by the fact that the matter is sub judice we however for the purposes of educating the public make the following observations:\n\n(a) the judgement of the Federal high Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13% derivation, National Economic Development Council and many other currently levied and collected by the Federal Government of Nigeria, Federal Inlands Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State Government had enacted their own VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum have expressed support for this course of action;\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by these State Government as a sales tax. If every State enacted its own VAT Law, multiple taxation will result in increases of prices of goods and services and collapsed in interstate trade. VAT is not a production tax like excise, but terminal tax which is paid by the ultimate consumer;\n\n\u201cAnother confusion is ignoring observation above and its \u201coverall effect. The reason Lagos account for our 50% VAT collection is because most of the telecommunication companies, Banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in Lagos with the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT\n\n\u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgment on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is sub-judice and Northern States Governors Forum would respect this.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Major markets in Enugu, including Ogbete and Abakpa markets, banks and petrol stations were shut.\n\nLeadership of the IPOB have repeatedly announced an end to the Monday sit-at-home but some hoodlums have insisted it must continue until Nnamdi Kanu is released. This has resulted in violent attacks on soft targets especially commercial vehicles.\n\nIn spite of the relaxation of the order, residents of Aba, Abia State, observed what many described as self-imposed sit-at-home, turning the commercial city into a ghost town.\n\nReports indicated that residents of Aba stayed at home out of fear of the unknown.\n\nThe city was said to have been deserted, particularly in the morning hours except the suburbs where commercial tricycle operators provided skeletal services.\n\nBanks in the city shut their gates to customers, as markets although opened, but there were no traders.\n\nFilling stations were all closed, the city was deserted as human and vehicular movements were restricted to the suburbs.\n\nSchools closed their gates, forcing teachers, students and pupils to stay at home.\n\nThe state capital of Umuahia, however, witnessed a different story as the city bubbled more than it had in previous Mondays since the now suspended sit-at-home was announced about two months ago. People came out in their numbers on the streets indicating that life had fully returned to the city.\n\nBanks opened for business, workers went to work, businesses bubbled in the various markets in the city, even as there were human and vehicular movements.\n\nStudents and pupils went to school while filling stations opened for business.\n\nSome residents who spoke to Daily Sun expressed joy that life has returned to Umuahia on Mondays which they described as the prime day of the week in business activities.\n\nMeanwhile, IPOB has raised the alarm over alleged plot by bandits sponsored to attack the South East.\n\nIts Media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, disclosed in a statement while reacting to a media statement credited to one Shekau who claimed that IPOB was plotting to attack its own people in the east.\n\nPowerful claimed that it was only a distraction and cover-up to pave way for the purported terrorists group\u2019s invasion of the South East and South South.\n\n\u201cContrary to the vomit by this inconsequential fellow, IPOB has no plans to attack South Easterners and South Southerners. In the first place, violence is not part of our philosophy.\n\n\u201cAssuming we want to resort to violence, how can we attack our people who we are fighting for; it does not make any sense. But we know their motive for peddling this falsehood as our intelligent report confirm the importation and stockpilling of arms from Pakistan for their planned invasion of Biafraland but we are waiting for them.\n\n\u201cWe are so astonished that a terrorist like Shekau without surname will be the one telling Biafran people to hate their own while he and his kinsmen openly protect their own terrorists and bandits maiming and killing them in the the entire Northern region,\u201d Powerful stated.\n\nAlso, the group denied speculations making the rounds that it had declared \u2018no election\u2019 in Anambra State even as the scheduled date draws near. The group said no official pronouncement has been made to that effect.\n\nIt explained that such was not their priority for now but to actualise its struggle for Biafra nation just as it warned against equating the group with Boko Haram and bandits, maintaining that such comparison can only be be mischievous.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity that this ignoble fellow and attention seeker compared a non-violent movement like IPOB to Boko Haram terrorists created and groomed by the North to kill Jewish and Christian adherent, indigenous northerners and security agents.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note that contrary to speculations, IPOB has not officially declared \u2018no election in Anambra State\u2019. Our preoccupation is Biafra restoration. Anybody equating IPOB strategy with Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and Fulani herdsmen is ignorant and mischievous. Many acclaimed northerners don\u2019t know what we are doing to restore Biafra,\u201d Powerful said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "As the world marks the International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI), today, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has expressed worry about the magnitude in which federal government agencies, ministries and other institutions tolerate the deep-rooted order of secrecy in accessing and management of public information.\n\nWhile accusing federal government agencies and ministries of not living up to their obligations imposed on them by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the NGE expressed sadness over deliberate and sustained efforts on the part of federal government agencies and ministries to undermine the implementation of the legislation.\n\nIdentifying the significance of access to information, the 74th UN General Assembly had proclaimed September 28 as the International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI) at the UN level in October 2019.\n\nThe day, according to the Guild, had been proclaimed by UNESCO General Conference in 2015, following the adoption of the 38 C/Resolution 57 declaring September 28 of every year as International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI).\n\nIn a press statement issued on Monday to mark the day and signed by the NGE\u2019s President, Mustapha Isah and General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, the editors said the theme of the 2021 International Day for Universal Access to Information is to highlight the role of access to information laws and their implementation in order to \u2018\u2019build back strong institutions\u2019\u2019 for the public good and sustainable development, as well as to strengthen the right to information and international cooperation in the field of implementing this human right.\n\nThey said in spite of the existence of the Act, which was signed into law 10 years ago by former President Goodluck Jonathan, to ensure that Nigerians have access to public information and hold government accountable, there were still contentious issues over the implementation of the law.\n\n\u201cMany citizens and institutions that have sought public information from public offices, in line with the law, without any positive response, have openly protested about their difficulties. Many citizens and institutions have also expressed concerns over the issues surrounding the effective implementation of the law. We wonder why a government that said to be fighting corruption is working very hard to frustrate a law that is designed to stimulate accountability of public officers to the citizenry and transparency in the conduct of public business.\u2019\u2019\n\nRecalling that the demand by citizens for access to information law arose from great instances of public disenchantment with the government at all levels, essentially on the grounds of corruption in the public service, the Guild particularly identified the National Assembly as a major culprit in the frustration of implementation of the Act.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is a major culprit in frustrating the implementation of FIOA. The institution has consistently failed/refused to comply with FOIA. It has failed to offer any information, as requested by citizens, media houses and members of the civil society organisations. It has failed to submit an annual report on its implementation of the Act \u2013 even for one year, in line with the provisions of the Act. The National Assembly has not taken its responsibilities as provided for under the Act, more earnestly and has failed to work towards compliance with the Act, including reporting on its implementation.\u201d\n\nThe Guild also said the Oath of Secrecy being administered on public servants by the presidency, as seen recently, has become a strong factor against the implementation of FOI Act.\n\nThe professional group said forcing public servants to take an oath of allegiance and secrecy before assumption of office, with the sole purpose of securing loyalty from them, had led to headstrong darkness in the administration of government as virtually all expenditures, procurements and other activities are carried out in highest secrecy.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Wants National Assembly to revisit Electoral Act\n\n*Says commission not subordinate to NCC\n\n*Saraki asks legislature to act in national interest\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has asked the National Assembly to revisit the Electoral Act amendment bill, assuring that it has the capacity and technical knowhow to undertake electronic transmission of election results throughout the country. INEC declared that it was not subordinate to the National Communication Commission (NCC) or answerable to any government agency.\n\nIn a similar development, former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, advised members of the Joint Conference Committee of the National Assembly to move fast in considering the different versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill passed by both chambers and let their decisions be guided only by national interest.\n\nThat was as the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, a coalition of over 70 organisations, asked the Senate to quickly resolve the conflicting aspects of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill so as to save the country from long-drawn litigations and uncertainty, which could put INEC\u2019s preparations for the elections in jeopardy.\n\nINEC called on the Senate and House of Representatives to quickly amend Sections 63, 65 and other relevant sections of the Electoral Act, which bar the commission from collation of election results electronically. It insisted that electronic transmission of results was doable, and it would guarantee safety, honesty and transparency.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, insisted that the electronic transmission of results real time was the best guarantee of transparency.\n\nSpeaking in a television programme monitored in Abuja on Monday, Okoye said INEC was determined to use electronic devices to improve Nigeria\u2019s electoral process, and deliver free, fair and credible elections. Okoye said for such to become a reality, the National Assembly must show courage by amending the relevant sections of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough INEC is increasingly tilting towards the use of technology to deliver a free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria, we want the National Assembly to amend the law, which prescribed the method elections are being conducted at the moment.\u201d\n\nOkoye admitted that INEC was still using the manual method, as enshrined in the Electoral Act, by collating election results from the Polling Units (PU), using Form EC8A, and Registration Area Collation Centre (RACC), with Form EC8B up to local government areas, and using Form EC8C to collate results, which are computed manually before announcement.\n\nOkoye maintained that INEC had perfected the use of technology to conduct elections starting from the 2023 general election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFor us to alter the methodology, the Electoral Act must be changed to accommodate the new innovations. We want National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act to enable INEC deliver a more transparent, fair and credible elections that will meet the aspirations of Nigerians. They should also look at 51, 52, 53 and 57 of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWe are already uploading election results electronically but we will need the relevant sections of the Electoral Act to be amended to avoid litigations, because INEC doesn\u2019t want our election winners to be determined by the law courts.\u201d\n\nOkoye said the commission was not answerable to NCC or any other federal government organ in carrying out its constitutional duties, saying INEC has inherent powers to conduct elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cNobody can bully INEC to share its powers given by the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria of Nigeria. Section 160 of Nigerian constitution mandates INEC to give NCC duties to perform, not NCC giving INEC orders.\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 52 of Electoral Act gives INEC inherent powers to conduct elections in any manner it wants, including e-voting. Again, the 2015 Electoral Act (as amended), which was signed by the former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has given INEC unfettered powers to conduct elections in the best method available.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the present method of manual collation of election results from PU, RACC and LGA should be done away with, adding, \u201cWith the introduction of Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) and other devices by INEC, elections in Nigeria can only get better, hence, National Assembly should join in deepening Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Saraki said in a statement by the head of his media office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, that the harmonisation of the versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill and its eventual passage should be concluded in time so that the law could be assented to before the political process leading to the 2023 general election. He said the success of the next round of elections would depend on the existence of a new enabling law with relevant provisions that would guarantee a credible, free, fair and peaceful process.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThat is why it is important that members of the Conference Committee should strive hard to rise above partisan and personal considerations. They should take decisions solely based on national interest and the need to strengthen our electoral process. The country is bigger than our various political parties. Nigeria is even bigger than any individual or any loyalty we may have to an individual.\n\n\u201cThat is why members of the committee should give genuine and deep consideration to the delicate issue of adopting the provision on electronic transmission of results, which will help to strengthen our electoral process, deepen our democracy and improve the level of participation in the elections.\n\n\u201cYour assignment is very crucial to the future of our country and if through your work we get a good law that will help in reforming the political process, you will be completing a great circle in the building of a legacy. It is a circle that started, when the immediate past National Assembly passed the same bill and only failed to get presidential assent, because of the politics of the period.\n\n\u201cI want to remind members of the respective hallowed and honourable chambers that at this point in our national history, we cannot fail to seize the opportunity that this bill presents to us to enthrone a credible and transparent electoral process. Whatever you do as you consider this bill is your own role in making history, in saving our democracy and building a future that is stable and progressive, where elected leaders truly represent the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that even after leaving the National Assembly, I have consistently canvassed the need for us to quickly pass a new Electoral Act that will include important provisions aimed at developing our electoral system. On one occasion in September 2020, during a webinar conference on \u2018Electoral Reforms and Democracy\u2019 organised by Centre for Advancement of Civil Liberties, I called on Nigerians to continue to create awareness on the importance of the Bill ahead of the 2023 elections\n\n\u201cAt this point, I need to appreciate the efforts of young people across the country, who went round spending their time and resources to create events aimed at generating awareness on the Bill, all members of the National Assembly, who have made sacrifices to get us this far, various development partners, civil society groups, members of the press and other stakeholders who played different roles in getting the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill to the semi-final stage, where it is almost getting to the point of becoming an effective Act of Parliament. We must continue to improve our system until we achieve the real objective of \u2018One Man, One Vote\u2019 and where the votes of the electorate count.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room said the version of the Electoral Act Amendment bill stipulating the recommendation of NCC before transmission of results electronically was a breach of the constitution. Convener of the group, Ene Obi, said at a news conference on Monday in Abuja that this would not augur well for democracy in the country. Obi insisted that the power to determine the procedure for transmission of results should be vested with INEC.\n\nThe Situation Room and its European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), its implementing partners, called on the National Assembly to show selflessness during the harmonisation.\n\nIt stated, \u201cNotwithstanding the landmark proposals in the on-going review process, civil society partners and key stakeholders have identified about 17 points of divergence in the versions of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed by the National Assembly. These are the use of smart card readers, deployment of electronic voting, collation and transmission of results, cost of campaigns, process of nomination of candidates, among others.\n\n\u201cAs expressed by a vast majority of electoral stakeholders and Nigerians, we are concerned by these identified differences in the proposals, particularly, regarding electronic transmission of results and deployment of technological devices.\n\n\u201cFollowing from our experience and observations of elections in recent years, as well as widely held views by Nigerians, we expect the harmonisation committee to accept the version of the bill that allows INEC to determine the mode of conduct of elections, including transmission of results.\u201d\n\nObi said INEC had shown that it had adequate capacity to use technology in elections, including the transmission of results.\n\nEne added that INEC\u2019s capability had been proven during the off-circle elections and through its use of the Z-pad and more recently, the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nAnother member of the Situation Room, Cynthia Mbamalu, said the group recommended the adoption of the senate version of clause 43, which recognised that INEC could use voting devices alongside election materials.\n\nIn addition, Mbamalu said, the group urged the harmonisation committee to adopt the Senate\u2019s version of clause 49, which recognised the use of other technological devices alongside smart card readers for voter accreditation. She added that the House of Representatives version of clause 52 should be adopted, as it gave INEC the power to determine the procedure for voting and transmission of election results.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Eight persons sustained various degrees of injury, while the terrorists burnt down about 20 houses.\n\nThe attacks came roughly 24 hours after another set of terrorists suspected to be members of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) attacked a joint military base, codenamed \u201cBurkusuma camp\u201d, in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State, reportedly, killing 15 soldiers, three Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers, and a police man.\n\nThere was, also, a reprisal attack in Kacecere village in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, which claimed another eight lives.\n\nConfirming the development, the Kaduna State government said the reprisal attack was fuelled by the attack that claimed the lives of 34 people and the destruction of houses by the terrorists.\n\nThe Nigeria Army, yesterday, confirmed that ISWAP attacked its base in Sabon Birni, Sokoto State.\n\nRev. Father Michael Magaji of the Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan, in Kaduna State, who confirmed the invasion of the two communities late Sunday night by gunmen, told THISDAY by telephone that the communities were about five kilometres from Kafanchan town. Magaji said most of those killed were women and children. He said the gunmen shot sporadically as they arrived the villages, killing 32 people.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am in the hospital as I speak with you. We have brought 32 corpses for embalmment. We have eight people injured and they are receiving treatment. About 20 houses were burnt, 13 persons from the same family were killed. We intend to have a mass burial to call the attention of the world to what is happening to our people.\u201d\n\nThe senator for Southern Kaduna, Danjuma La\u2019ah, condemned the attack and lamented the persistent attacks in the area, which had led to the killing of hundreds of people.\n\nLa\u2019ah appealed to the people of the area to remain calm and avoid taking the law into their hands. He also called on the authorities concerned to scale up security in the area to avoid further attacks and destruction of lives and property.\n\n\u201cIf government refuses to take proactive measures to address the issue, the people will be left with no option than to embark on self-defence,\u201d the senator said.\n\nIn a separate statement confirming the reprisal attack yesterday, Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, blamed the reprisal attack that led to the deaths of eight people on the killing of the 34 people in Madamai village, Kaura Local Government Area, and one Yakubu Danjuma in Kacecere village in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cThe Kaduna State government has received reports from security agencies of an attack by unidentified persons in Kacecere village, Zangon Kataf LGA, which has resulted in the deaths of some citizens.\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, this attack was in reprisal to earlier attacks in Jankasa village, Zangon Kataf LGA, where one Mr. Yakubu Danjuma was killed, and also in Madamai in Kaura LGA where 34 persons were killed.\u201d\n\nHe said security agencies reported that the attacks in the two locations \u201cled to the reprisal by unidentified assailants on Kacecere community, which has left eight dead, six persons injured and several houses razed.\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, unidentified gunmen attacked Madamai village in Kaura local government. The troops mobilised to the location and also came under fire before forcing the assailants to withdraw after an intense exchange (of fire.\n\n\u201cSome houses were set ablaze by the attackers at one end of the village. The troops put out the fire at three of the burning houses, and rescued six locals from the infernos. As of the time of this update, 34 residents have been confirmed dead following the attack.\u201d\n\nAruwan said Governor Nasir El-Rufai had expressed deep sadness at the reports and offered his condolences to the families of the deceased.\n\nThe commissioner said, \u201cThe governor appealed for recourse to the law and urged communities to eschew reprisals and similar violent actions. He also tasked security agencies to conduct thorough investigations into the incident. As of the time of this update, troops and police personnel are working in the locations and the public will be briefed after official reports are received.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said two suspects had been arrested in connection with the killings.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai has stated that the Kaduna State Government will bear the full cost of injured victims\u2019 treatment,\u201d Aruwan stated.\n\nHe said the governor had also been briefed by security agencies on the roles played by the Chief of Kagoro, His Royal Highness, Chief Ufuwai Bonet, and the lawmaker representing Kaura Federal Constituency, Hon. Gideon Gwani, in dousing tension and preventing a breakdown of law and order following the unfortunate incident.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe governor commended their efforts and sterling leadership. The governor ordered an urgent assessment of the area by the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency, towards the provision of succour to the affected households.\n\n\u201cThe governor received the reports with intense grief, and expressed his condemnation of the gruesome attack, which he described as an unspeakable display of wickedness, meriting the severest form of punishment.\n\n\u201cHe further tasked security agencies to ensure urgent and precise investigations into the horrific incident.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that \u201ctwo suspects are being questioned in connection with the attack\u201d and security agencies were conducting operations in the general area, promising, \u201cThe government will update citizens accordingly.\u201d\n\nOn the attack on the Sokoto military base at the weekend, villagers and security sources told THISDAY that the assault happened in the early hours of Friday.\n\nThe terrorists, THISDAY gathered, came in large numbers and started shooting at the camp from different angles.\n\nA military source, which was not authorised to speak on the matter, said a large number of suspected bandits were killed when a military base was attacked in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto.\n\nThe source did not confirm if the military camp was the same as the Burkusuma camp in Sabo Birni local government.\n\nA former chairman of Sabon Birni Local Government Area, Idris Muhammad Gobir, known as Danchadi, also confirmed to newsmen that the Burkusuma camp was attacked and several security operatives in the camp were still missing.\n\nGobir said the marauding terrorists burnt down two patrol vehicles and carted away another one, which was used to convey food items stolen from the villagers.\n\nThe former chairman said the report of the attack was confirmed to them by a resident of Burkusuma, who used a mobile telecommunications service from Niger Republic.\n\nA prominent traditional ruler in the area also confirmed that some vehicles were sent to evacuate corpses of those killed. He said over 10 trucks conveying armed military personnel were at the moment in the forest trailing the bandits.\n\nAn NSCDC personnel, who also pleaded anonymity, confirmed that three of their members were among the casualties.\n\nThe gunmen also reportedly attacked Katsira village and shot four persons. Two of the victims were said to have died instantly while the other two were taken to an undisclosed hospital.\n\nThe gunmen were said to have abducted three persons from the village.\n\nThe spokesman of the 8 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major Yahaya Ngulde, could not be reached for comments on the developments.\n\nSimilarly, Police Public Relation Officer, ASP Sanusi Abubakar, said he was not aware of the attack.\n\nBut the military, while confirming the story in a press release by Director, Defence Information, Maj Gen Benjamin Olufemi Sawyer, said Operation Hadarin Daji troops successfully repelled the attack. Sawyer said in the process, scores of insurgents were eliminated while others fled with bullet wounds to Niger Republic. He disclosed that the attack took place at Burkusuma in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nSawyer further disclosed that aggressive operations of troops of the FOB, as witnessed in recent months in the North-west, had been a thorn in the flesh of ISWAP and bandits. He said the attackers came in large numbers using telecom network provided from neighbouring country, and capitalised on the lean rear area protection force, when the main troops were out conducting offensive operations within their area of responsibility.\n\nSawyer, however, stated that the swift reinforcement by troops helped to counter the attack, as many of the ISWAP fighters were eliminated while some scrambled with various degrees of injury, resulting in their pursuit to Bassira in Niger Republic.\n\nUnfortunately, he said, there was some level of casualty recorded on the part of the troops during the encounter but refused to give figures.\n\nThe Nigerian and Nigerien forces, in a collaborative operation, Sawyer hinted, had begun to trail the remaining ISWAP fighters, while the general security within the FOB and its environs had been stabilised.\n\nA medical personnel said on condition of anonymity that they brought 15 corpses of soldiers to specialist hospitals Sokoto yesterday.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government condemned the attack on military base in the state. Commissioner for Security and Career Studies, Col. Garba Moyi, said the attack was barbaric and unwarranted\n\nMoyi stated that the attack would not deter security agencies in the bid to safeguard the country from insurgents.\n\nMoyi noted that the government and the people of Sokoto State sympathised with Nigerian Army and other agencies that suffered casualties in the incident. He reiterated the state government\u2019s commitment to supporting the security agencies in their determination to win the war against the insurgents.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

score at least 25 per cent of the votes cast in two-third of the states of the federation.\u201d\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their joint meeting with Northern Traditional Rulers in Kaduna yesterday, the governors also spoke on the on-going controversy over the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), declaring that it is \u201cbeing confused by Rivers and Lagos state governments as a sales tax.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, which was read by the chairman of the forum and governor of Plateau State, Mr. Simon Lalong, also insisted that the position of the southern governors on power shift contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Forum observed that some Northern States Governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three geo-political zones in the South with a view to promoting unity and peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemns the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 stated that the meeting considered the on-going national debate on the collection of VAT, stating, \u201cAs responsible leaders, while we are constrained by the fact that the matter is subjudice, we, however, for the purposes of educating the public, make the following observations: the judgement of the Federal High Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13 per cent derivation, National Economic Development Council and many other currently levied and collected by the federal government, Federal Inlands Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State governments had enacted their own VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum has expressed support for this course of action; VAT is being confused by these state governments as a sales tax.\u201d\n\nThe northern governors argued further, \u201cIf every state enacted its own VAT law, multiple taxation will result in increases of prices of goods and services and collapsed in interstate trade.\n\n\u201cVAT is not a production tax like excise, but terminal tax which is paid by the ultimate consumer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governors, \u201cAnother confusion is ignoring observation above and its \u2018overall effect.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey pointed out that the reason Lagos State accounted for over 50 per cent VAT collection was because most of the telecommunication companies, banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in the state, \u201cwith the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added, \u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgement on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is subjudice and Northern States Governors Forum would respect this.\u201d\n\nThe governors also decried what they described as \u201cthe high level of conspiracies being perpetrated by some judicial officers in releasing or granting bail to arrested criminals, maintaining that, \u201cthis attitude sabotages the fight against criminality.\u201d\n\nThe governors reviewed security situation in the North and called for a sustained synergy and coordinated efforts between the federal and the northern states governments to tackle the situation.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also noted with concern the constraint of the security services and urged the Armed Forces to embark on simultaneous operations, and\u2026assured of their readiness to work in synergy with the federal government in finding lasting solution to the current security challenges,\u201d the forum added.\n\nFurthermore, the governors commended the on-going onslaught against banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram, especially in the North-east, North-west, and North-central geopolitical zones.\n\nThe governors called on the security agencies to live up to their responsibility and urged traditional rulers to mobilise their various communities to check the ugly trend of criminality in their domains.\n\nThe governors lamented the ugly trend in the spread of drugs and consumption among the youth and called on governments and communities to rise to the occasion and stem the tide.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 urged the federal government to expedite action on the National Livestock Transformation Programme as a springboard in transiting from the open grazing system as widely practised in the North.\n\nThe meeting was attended by the governors of Plateau, Kaduna, Sokoto, Nasarawa, Borno, Jigawa, Gombe, and the deputy governor of Kano State. Also at the meeting was the Chairman of the Northern Traditional Rulers Council, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, and the emirs of Zazzau, Bauchi, and Kano.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Dele Momodu: A Child Of Independence In Search Of Freedom, By Toyin Falola",
          "text": "Deserving ovation in any part of the world is a matter of maintaining a positive impact after the evaluation of one's accumulated deeds. Humans are not popular with the habit of giving accolades to people who are not deserving of it, and if they are compelled to do so, it would be noticed from the get-go that they are merely following instructions, making motions, or being sarcastic. One of the notable people whom Nigerians may give accolades to without compulsion is Chief Dele Momodu. Many people have written their names in the golden book of Nigeria, and it appears the journalist and businessman is one of them. Dele Momodu has not only written his name on the sand of time as far as Nigerian celebrity and popular life are concerned, but he has also brought himself to the forefront of national and international debates, showing up in public issues for all things good.\n\nAyobamidele Momodu was born to Nigerian parents in the same year Nigeria secured its independence from its foremost colonizer, Britain, in 1960. His birth became symbolic with the country of birth because he represents freedom for his immediate parents and a family of people who have benefited from his immense intellectual efforts. From an early age, Momodu developed a passion for journalism and became steadfast in the pursuit of this lofty ambition. To him, that profession means more than being a platform for interviewing the big fishes in the world who have made substantial changes in human history. He considers journalism an opportunity to connect with the masses and represent those rendered voiceless in their respective societies.\n\nOne would be enthused by the mind-opening input that Dele Momodu has contributed to Nigeria's and, by extension, Africa's journalism profession, going by the mouthwatering initiatives he has been making with his different journalism outlets. He blends passion with opportunity and creates effortless ideas that are record-breaking and intellectually stimulating. His undying and enthusiastic passion for journalism drove him to meet notable personalities as far as Nigerian politics and economic engagement are concerned. Because he was outstanding in his chosen profession, he has had the opportunity to meet top politicians in the world and used that opportunity to advance himself personally. Through his journalism profession, Momodu has increased his self-worth so much that in contemporary times, there is no place his name would be mentioned in the Nigerian political and media landscape in particular, and in the African continent in general, where he would not get special recognition and impressive remarks from people. His name has become so domestic that people do not struggle to fix who he is in their minds. Momodu believes in activism, and he does not limit the ground for activism to the political ring since, in his opinion, activism can be introduced to one's profession in a grand style and maximum impact can be made through it irrespective of the field.\n\nOne gets to understand what he means with his ideological stand about using journalism as the launchpad for activism when he stood behind a man whose political mandate was forcefully and criminally taken away from him in 1993. Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola (MKO) became the victim of the power play of the General Ibrahim Babangida's administration, where the latter denied MKO Abiola of his democratic mandate. The action ruptured the people and angered many well-wishers because the denial of his right could steer inter-ethnic conflict, as the country was delineated along ethnolinguistic and ethnocultural lines, and could wreak untold emotional and political havoc on the country generally. Momodu was strongly behind MKO, not only because he had worked under him as a Staff Writer in the African Concord magazine, but also because he believed that part of a global democratic process is to stand against dictators when they decide to challenge the will of the majority. For this ideological conviction, it would be interesting to know that the man remained steadfast behind the victim of military veto power, not without paying a heavy price, however. Ibrahim Babangida's administration was succeeded by that of the late General Sanni Abacha, and one does need to be reminded about the extreme high-handed nature of these dictators.\n\nMomodu was one of the heroes who championed the canonization of June 12, the occasion of which saw the annulment of the presidential election that registered MKO Abiola as the victor. It did not require the intelligence of Wole Soyinka to understand that he was up against an insurmountable challenge by calling the dictators by their name. He was mercilessly punished and subsequently detained because he followed pro-democratic ideas that supported the recognition of Abiola's political mandate. Despite the growing challenges and mounting intimidation, Dele did not throw in the towel against the dictators. He continued to demonstrate his commitment to revolutionizing Nigerian politics through democratic means and insisted on his loyalty to his mentor, the late MKO. However, when Abacha became the head of state, he compounded the challenges because he was devoid of a sense of justice or fairness and was unconcerned about tearing the fabric of the country's democracy by pursuing extremely selfish interests at the presidential seat. Before being confined to the prison, this man allowed his Radio Freedom to continue engaging the military dictators and exposing their irrational fantasy about power and its flagrant abuse. He became the maverick of the society and dared to challenge a totalitarian whose sole language was force. Momodu stood his ground and registered his grievances and those of the masses, but not without corresponding consequences.\n\nWhen the situation got to the climax, Momodu was forced to seek freedom in another man's land because it seemed the government of General Sani Abacha would not adopt a gentleman\u2019s approach concerning issues of protests or disagreement with totalitarian disposition. Momodu had to take the option of running away from the country under disguise. He traveled to the Republic of Benin, where he eventually found his way to Togo and then Ghana, before fleeing to the United Kingdom. These periods were a moment of reflection for him and a test of his resolve, especially regarding his ideological beliefs. He was aware that Nigeria\u2019s military government had never demonstrated a gentlemanly approach to national issues; nevertheless, Momodu desired to pursue the course of justice regardless of whose ox was gored. This level of commitment to one's philosophical position stands Momodu out and explains why he has garnered for himself the international accolades that are globally accorded to him in the past and present conditions. Even when he was in exile abroad, he would not allow his candle of truth to be blown off by the wind of fear, or melted into oblivion under the shadow of intimidation. He provided the opportunity to expand his agitation beyond the borders of the country, and through his continuous delivery of sound journalism, he attracted the right minds to his trade and revolutionary ideas.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 still holds that \u201cTough times do not last, only tough people do.\u201d This saying has reflected its true value in the life of Dele Momodu because not only did he survive the harsh government positions against him during the time of his pro-democratic ideals, but he also established himself as a reliable voice in the time of despair when the government slips into the abyss of dictatorship and lawlessness. Momodu has contributed significantly to the democratic ethos that the country is not basking in, and he has not reneged on giving his country of birth the best things that showcase democratic culture. Despite the history of torments and frustrations that has greeted him in different times when he raised his voice in the country against apparent totalitarian governments, Momodu continues to offer the best of his services to douse people's despair and restore their confidence even when things are going sour in the country. He has demonstrated on countless occasions that he does not belong to the group of people who cow away from their philosophical position because a leader decided to be high-handed about their political activities. And this has brought him great patronage from people who understand the importance of his voice in setting the country on the right trajectory.\n\nBeyond his activism in the journalism profession, Momodu has been a man who represents a good character in career development. The story of his growth to fame is replete with daunting experiences and the determination to survive unusual conditions, and the swift progress he has made in the course of his career development is sure to leave one amazed. For a man that officially secured his first employment in 1988 as a Staff Writer in Concord Magazine, a journalism firm owned by the late MKO Abiola, being immediately transferred to Weekend Concord as a pioneer staff by the same company was evidence of his brilliant performance on the previous job. He obviously showed outstanding contributions that led to admiration from his employer and subsequent promotions. Nearly has he spent a year in this position than he was made the Literary Editor, and barely spent six months on the new job, he was made the News Editor of the Weekend Concord. His involvement in all these engagements brought out the best in him, and he continued to break boundaries where people made excuses for their failures. Dele Momodu followed this line of thought and excellence and was eventually considered a beacon of hope in the Nigerian editorial and journalism profession. Apparently, he was not a man to be restrained by unfavorable circumstances, as he defied numerous challenges to write his name in gold.\n\nAdditionally, through his habit of moving geometrically, Momodu\u2019s journalism career has been transformed in every position and condition. Momodu\u2019s fervor as a journalist placed him at quandary with military dictators as he was at loggerhead with numerous Nigerian heads of state in the post-annulment of the June 12 presidential elections. During the period, he launched Ovation International in 1996 despite being in exile for his involvement in the political affairs of his home country. He was not deterred by the exile experience, which naturally makes some people lose a good deal of their emotional and psychological well-being. Instead, he made himself more relevant and created a celebrity magazine forum that would promote him beyond his imagination. Today, Momodu embodies all the qualities of a good social being and a committed individual, such that his influence spans beyond his cultural and political shores because his newspaper takes him into prominent territories where people now have a better understanding of what he represents. Ovation International\u2019s reputation in Africa remains golden because of its linguistic flexibility and content. It adds more color to the famous publisher that the magazine is written in both English and French.\n\nThe story of this great man would not be complete without a leaf from his educational career. He is considered successful and accomplished to the extent that his academic skills are exceptional and excellently glamorous. For someone who studied Yoruba as his undergraduate degree, one should be impressed to understand the transformative capacity of the man who made sufficient success in English and literary engagement. Although his master\u2019s degree is in English Literature, it cannot be contested that his background in Yoruba helped skyrocket him into the stardom of journalism. Before he became eternally glued to the journalism profession, he was a lecturer at the beginning of his career. This period of teaching in a higher institution was the time of his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), where he was given the opportunity to test-run his intellectual capacity. During the one-year program, Dele Momodu registered a stellar performance that granted him the opportunity to be more received by people of national values. After this experience, he began to attract members of the society who have added so much economic and financial value to themselves.\n\nServing as the private personal secretary to an erstwhile Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Chief Akin Omoboriowo, was a feat that brought him to political limelight because not only did he manage the reputation of his principal very satisfactorily, he also gave his professional touches to everything assigned to him. During his professional experience under the deputy governor, Momodu understood the country's political system, and he was able to gather maximum experience that helped shape his career path in the long run. As the deputy governor\u2019s private personal secretary, Momodu did not get any negative appraisal that would have potentially dented his image just because he did not lose sight of what mattered most. His success in that position attracted him to many other personalities who wanted him to manage their portfolio for them one way or another. While serving and making numerous accomplishments under his principal, his dedication made way for him with other notable personalities in society. One year after working with the deputy governor, he was made the manager of Motel Royal Limited, a business owned by the then Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade Olubuse II. The Ooni also obviously enjoyed Momodu\u2019s services, and this catapulted him to greater heights.\n\nDespite making a substantial impact and improving himself in all these engagements, Momodu is not easily carried away by minor accomplishments. He decided to advance his studies, knowing full well that having a solid educational foundation and diverse skill sets to function well is one of the most reliable ways to excel in an evolving country like Nigeria. He left his job as a manager to pursue his master\u2019s degree in English Literature. This exposed him to different academic strategies and knowledge of literature which he used to sharpen his writing skills. As a result of his versatility and advanced literary scholarship through his different engagements and activities as a journalism expert, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Professional Studies, Accra, Ghana.\n\nOne of the best ways to allude to the social and political impact that Momodu has made within the relatively short period that he emerged in the Nigeria sociopolitical and sociocultural milieu as a very important personality is by making mention of the number of the awards, accolades, and honors associated to him. Beyond the recognition as Doctor of Humane Letters are other numerous accolades and awards in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of Nigerian political and journalism affairs. He is a columnist with This Day newspaper, where he writes a weekly feature for \u201cPENdulum.\u201d The articles he writes in this newspaper are celebrated because they highlight emergent national issues that happen in the sociocultural environment of the country. The readership of his weekly column is continuously expansive because he carries people along in matters that have to do with their day-to-day political experiences. To the extent that all these writings are cardinal to the socio-political conditions of the country, and individuals across the country find something to relate with when he pens down his ideas.\n\nIt is unarguable that this man is eclectic in approach, and the coverage of his intellectual and professional interests is essentially wide. For someone who ventures into journalism, the addition of fashion and entertainment issues into what he discusses makes him more received by people who are always expectant of his engagement. Since 2008, he has annually organized the Ovation Red Carol, which eventually morphed into Ovation Carol and Awards. Usually in attendance at the program are great people who have made commendable accomplishments in their various careers and have advanced the society with their valuable contributions. The popularity of this event is widespread so much that it has won the accolade for being one of the most celebrated events during the yuletide period in the country. The event is known as the avenue for music celebrities to perform and showcase their talents for the audience who have also come to relieve their all-year-long emotional tension. Beyond that, Momodu provides opportunities for emerging talents in the music industry who use the opportunity to showcase their talents and expand their networks of influence.\n\nDr. Dele Momodu is a committed journalist and a respected public opinion shaper. He dives into political issues and provides alternative perspectives to burning national issues. He has faced totalitarian governments and challenged them to their face, highlighting issues that need urgent national attention even when they feel uncomfortable with his style of bringing up issues. This man has built an image for himself that he is not particularly interested in tuning down his voice because his facts hit the most powerful people in society. Even when he has to face the brutal hands of the despotic leaders who have come to demonstrate their aversion to due process, Dele Momodu never shies away from standing his ground, even if it means standing alone.\n\nHe is a loving father, an admirable husband, and a responsible man who strenuously ensures that his family is upright and responsible. He is accessible, down-to-earth, and does not have the attitude of a dissident. He would not promote rivalries because he has to sell himself to the people, and neither would he allow personal sentiment to cloud his judgment in issues of national importance. Chief Dele Momodu is a friend that would stand for any cause he believes in. He did not desert his principal, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, when he was embattled by the military dictators. He sacrificed his freedom so that the voice of the masses would be heard loud and clear in the corridors of power. In fighting for you and I, the child of independence is in chains, seeking a second freedom.\n\nPlease join us for a conversation with Dele Momodu:\n\nSunday, October 10, 2021\n\n5:00 PM Nigeria\n\n4:00 PM GMT\n\n11:00 AM Austin CST\n\nRegister and Watch:\n\nhttps://www.tfinterviews.com/post/dele-momodu\n\nJoin via Zoom:\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/85976872129\n\nWatch on Facebook:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tfinterviews/live\n\nWatch on YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lvX7A2iVndiCq0NfFcb0w/live",

          "text": "Researchers at a new bionics centre established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plan to pilot a mobile imaging and delivery system of prosthetic limb services for disabled Sierra Leoneans.\n\nThe project \u2013 meant to ensure patients in medically underserved communities have access to prostheses \u2013 is listed as one of the four priorities for the research centre set up with $24 million in funding from philanthropist Lisa Yang.\n\nA statement released by MIT reveals that investigators will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customized prosthetics to disabled individuals.\n\nThe service will initially roll out in rural Sierra Leone, a West African country where thousands of people suffered amputations during an 11-year civil war. According to estimates, roughly 27,000 Sierra Leoneans were disabled or had one or more of their limbs amputated during the 1991-2002 war.\n\nMIT adds that while the population of people with amputated limbs continues to increase each year in Sierra Leone, less than 10% of that population currently benefits from functional prostheses.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThrough the mobile delivery system, a key centre objective is to scale up production and access of functional limb prostheses for Sierra Leoneans in dire need,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nSierra Leone President, Julius Maada Bio, describes the mobile prosthetics service fueled by the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics as \u201can innovative solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nThe MIT project aligns with President Bio\u2019s plans to make Sierra Leone a hub for technology and innovation.\n\nOne of the first things he did after assuming office in 2017 was set up a Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI) led by David Moinina Sengeh, the country\u2019s first-ever chief innovation officer who doubles as the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education.\n\nSengeh is an MIT and Harvard inventor whose research work to improve prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone will be leveraged by the MIT bionics centre.\n\nA crucial figure in the government\u2019s digitisation drive, he\u2019s introduced President Bio to TED Talks and tech activities at the universities of Oxford, Yale, and Harvard.\n\nOver the past four years, the President has participated in dialogues centered around using innovation and technology to transform food systems in Africa; given presentations on blockchain and the fourth industrial revolution; as well as visited MIT, where he detailed plans to make his nation a digital centre.\n\n\u201cI am proud that Sierra Leone will be the first site for deploying this state-of-the-art digital design and fabrication process,\u201d Bio said.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a government that promotes innovative technologies and prioritizes human capital development, I am overjoyed that this pilot project will give Sierra Leoneans (especially in rural areas) access to quality limb prostheses and thus improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nMore on the bionics centre\n\nThe K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics will be run by Hugh Herr, an MIT professor and double amputee. Broadly, it aims to develop technologies and surgical methods to mitigate disability because of injury, aging, or disease using interdisciplinary research.\n\nExperts from three MIT schools \u2013 Science, Engineering, and Architecture and Planning \u2013 as well as clinical and surgical collaborators at Harvard Medical School, are expected to work together at the new centre.\n\nFurthermore, the center will provide four endowed fellowships for MIT graduate students working in bionics or other research areas focused on improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe new K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics at MIT, made possible by a US$24 million gift from philanthropist Lisa Yang (center), will be led by Hugh Herr, professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab (left), and Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT (right). Image source: MIT News\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to support MIT on this major research effort to enable powerful new solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals who experience disability,\u201d said Yang, a former investment banker and a major supporter in autism research at MIT and Cornell University, among other institutions.\n\n\u201cThis new commitment extends my philanthropic investment into the realm of physical disabilities, and I look forward to the centre\u2019s positive impact on countless lives.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "China plans to deploy digital satellite TVs in 200 Togolese villages",
          "text": "The Chinese government plans to distribute digital satellite television and hardware in 200 villages across Togo, speeding up the West African country\u2019s plans to switch to digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting.\n\nDTT, which will replace analog television, is a technology that improves image quality and reduces operating costs inherent in broadcasting. In October 2019, the Togolese parliament passed a law authorising the DTT migration, a process that began a few years before the regulation was approved.\n\nThe project was expected to kick off with the construction of nine digital television signal transmission sites. However, it has stalled as DTT coverage in the French-speaking country remains low, and non-existent in rural areas. On paper, the Chinese intervention could ease Togo\u2019s transition from analog to digital satellites.\n\nChina\u2019s deputy trade minister Qian Keming said late last month the Asian powerhouse was \u201ccommitted to assisting in the implementation of this programme\u201d in Togo.\n\nThe Chinese project will cover more than a third of villages in the country, which is one of the smallest by land area and population in Africa with approximately 8 million people.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe 10,000 Villages Project\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s provision of satellite TV in Togo is part of a more extensive program in Africa, through which 10,000 villages in 20 countries are expected to receive DTT kits, with the aim of reducing the digital divide in rural Africa.\n\nSelected villages get solar-powered projector TVs, digital TV sets, satellite dishes, and decoders where they can watch 20 international and local channels free of charge. Local technicians also receive training on the installation and maintenance of the equipment.\n\nChinese media conglomerate StarTimes, contracted for the project, carried out the installation in neighboring West African countries Benin and Nigeria, where the company claims to have equipped public areas with satellite reception kits in 200 and 1,000 villages respectively. The same deployment was done in Uganda and Kenya.\n\nChinese presence in Africa\u2019s media\n\nStarTimes is one of the most popular pay-TV operators on the continent. Although it is technically a private company with no known government affiliation, the pay-TV operator plays a vital role in China\u2019s diplomacy push in Africa.\n\nChina\u2019s significant presence and influence in Africa, mainly in the areas of infrastructure development and trade, has expanded to include the media sector. Over the years, Beijing has invested significantly in the African media landscape, through projects like the DTT coverage.\n\nSeveral Chinese media organisations also boast a significant presence on the continent.\n\nThe state-funded Xinhua News Agency established a regional office in Nairobi in 2006 with a massive foreign correspondent network in Africa. It currently allows local media outlets to get content via its newswire without charge.\n\nThe China Global Television Network (CGTN) also has an African bureau headquartered in the Kenya capital, where it offers free and reduced broadcasting to television providers.\n\nBoth the China Daily publication and China Radio International have bureaus in Nairobi as well.\n\nA major aspect of StarTimes\u2019 ambitions in Africa is its ability to promote state broadcasters from the Asian nation, enabling easier access to Chinese content \u2013 from soap operas to news programmes. For instance, it broadcasts CGTN for free and offers the station with every subscription package.\n\nHowever, not all content on the platform is Chinese-produced.

          "text": "Source: TechCabal\n\nSeptember 27th, 2021.\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nOn Friday, towards the end of the Future of Commerce conference, I got into a chat with my colleague Damilare about his plans for the weekend. It included resting, hanging out with friends and watching some shows on Netflix.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention was him mentioning that he recently paid for a Netflix subscription. What made him make the switch? The recently released King of Boys series.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t sit out and miss out, so I had to. After all, it\u2019s just \u20a61,200 ($3),\u201d he said.\n\nMy first thought was that Damilare\u2019s sign up was an indication that Netflix\u2019s content strategy is making a difference. But when I thought about it again, I remembered that he signed up for the recently introduced mobile-only plan that costs 50% less than the standard plan.\n\nHis sign up is still a win for the streaming service but also a reminder that irrespective of how much people love Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, there are other competing priorities on this side of the world. To take a step further, there\u2019s an army of people whose mantra is free content or nothing.\n\nA screenshot of a blog comment section interaction between Kemi Adetiba (director and writer of King of Boys) and a few Nigerians who don\u2019t believe the series shouldn\u2019t exist behind Netflix\u2019s paywall.\n\nPartner Message\n\nHave you tried Flutterwave Mobile today?\n\nSource: Flutterwave\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here.\n\nAnswered prayers\n\nThis realization is most likely what influenced Netflix\u2019s decision to introduce a free plan in Kenya this week. Clearly, the $3.99 (mobile-only plan) is still too much to ask of Africans.\n\nUnlike the typical 30 days trial which gives users access to Netflix\u2019s full library for a limited time, in this free plan Netflix is only making about one quarter of its movies and television shows catalog available.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the goal of the free plan is to reduce the friction in acquiring users, but it\u2019s not clear how long Netflix plans to offer this free in Kenya and whether it\u2019s considering expanding this offering to other markets.\n\nAmongst other players like Amazon prime video, Disney+ and Showmax, Netflix is expected to have the highest number of African subscribers in 2026 per Digital TV research. While Netflix has added a free content approach to its stack, what are other players doing?\n\nMobolaji Adebayo \u2013 TechCabal Insights\n\nPartner Message\n\n30%Club\n\nTake control of your investing journey.

The company stated that its goal is \u2018provide internet access to those who do not have access to fibre services\u2019. In simple terms, it\u2019s cheaper internet service coupled with access to DSTV\u2019s content. DSTV internet packages are about 60% cheaper than MTN regular data plans. For instance, 25 Gigabyte (GB) anytime and 25 GB Night-time data costs R229 ($15.35), while a similar package by MTN costs R599 ($40.16).\n\nAlthough there are questions around whether the internet plan is being subsidized by multichoice and how long they can continue doing this, it\u2019s a clever customer acquisition strategy.\n\nFor IROKOtv, a streaming service for Nollywood, it\u2019s betting on international markets since Africa hasn\u2019t provided the financial comfort it\u2019s looking for.\n\n\u201cAfrica is functionally poor\u2026@irokotv did a free movie a week for like 2-3 years. Tens of thousands of people used it weekly. <2% conversion.\u201d Jason Njoku, CEO of IROKOtv, said via Twitter in response to Netflix\u2019s decision to pivot to free. According to Jason, IROKOtv had to shut down the experiment when it was apparent that conversion was low and many users weren\u2019t interested in paying for a premium subscription.\n\nIROKOtv has been around for ten years and experimented with different tactics before deciding to pivot to focus more on its international market.\n\nMobolaji Adebayo \u2013 TechCabal Insights\n\nWhat does it take to succeed in Africa as a streaming service?\n\nWe\u2019ll start off with a low expectation of what success looks like because macro economic factors like disposable income, internet and smartphone penetration are low. After that we introduce cheap subscription plans and then create or acquire entertaining content to draw in new customers. This formula isn\u2019t complete until you sprinkle a lot of patience and luck because the journey is long and Africa is a different market.\n\nNetflix and Multichoice clearly have bigger purses than IROKOtv to persevere and try out a number of tactics hoping for a different result, but time will tell if more Africans will start paying for content.\n\nPartner Message\n\nStanford GSB\n\nNext on the Grit & Growth podcast: meet Elo Umeh, CEO of Terragon Group, a Nigerian marketing and insights firm, and experts from TLcom Capital, and learn how to maximise the value of your firm\u2019s next fundraising round.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a cold night in June 2019. Like most nights, 15-year-old Chidiebere is walking the streets of Lagos. The air is stuffy as fumes of carbon monoxide emissions combine with the smell of sewage, leaving an unbearable stench.\n\nEveryone seems to be in a rush, going someplace. Prospective buyers converge on expectant sellers. Wanderers are roaming. The others can only care less. They just want to go home and get some sleep. It\u2019s been a long day.\n\nHome. This word echoes through Chidibiere\u2019s head. He tries to imagine an actual bed, a roof without holes, and walls bearing no cracks through which lizards visit.\n\nScreeching tyres and the loud sound of metal crashing into metal from a nearby accident break his trance. But thoughts of a comfortable home return. Maybe one with chairs and a dining set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he understands the difference between needs and wants, and what matters most is a full stomach.\n\nHome. Anything but a worn, bare mattress on the cemented floor and 4 a.m. baths taken with sand beneath his feet.\n\nOut of the frying pan into the fire would be a fitting title if his life were a movie or a book.\n\nAfter losing his father to death\u2019s cold hands, he had to watch his mother eke out a living every day as she tried to feed her children and pay an elephant-sized rent for an ant-sized space.\n\nHow is meaning defined in a state of such deep despair? Hope seems like a long-lost friend, in its place, an empty stomach and dreams of a happy life. One in which he didn\u2019t have to attend school two out of five days due to outstanding fees.\n\nIt\u2019s August 2021, and Chidiebere is in a better place. Now 17 years old and armed with mastery in three programming languages, Python and Java included, he is preparing for the forthcoming West African Examination Council (WAEC) exams, looking to get into the university, and pursuing a long-coveted career in football. Big dreams, but doable.\n\nThings seem to be looking up. But don\u2019t fairy-god mothers appear only in Cinderella-esque tales? Well, it turns out that a certain charity organisation has taken to transforming the lives of children on the streets of Nigeria using an underlying triad mission of care, empowerment, and education.\n\nIn 2012, Abimbola Ojenike, a litigation and transactional lawyer practising in his legal firm as at the time, couldn\u2019t help but notice that a large number of children roamed the streets during school hours. He identified this as a big problem and got Kemi Oluboba, Co-founder and Ikem Isiekwena, Co-founder, aboard on a mission to solve this challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe did checks about them and realised that most of them were actually homeless. We saw this as a challenge and decided to solve a problem around education for people who have no home at all, and also to be able to empower and provide care to them, because education cannot be sustainable if people have no stable home at all,\u201d Ojenike told Techpoint Africa.\n\nGlobally, there is a staggering number of out-of-school children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) counts 258 million children, and as of 2020, 65,165, 951 of this figure lived in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@trevcole?\n\nReasons like forceful home evictions, child neglect, and chief of all, poverty account for those numbers.\n\nMany of Africa\u2019s population live in slums, with most homes headed by unemployed single mothers. In most cases, children in these situations are abandoned and take to the streets to find food and a sense of belonging.\n\nAt the point of founding, The Destiny Trust Children Foundation kicked off operation as a centre for providing shelter and rehabilitation to homeless children while partnering with schools to help the children get access to education.\n\n\u201cOur programs are in three aspects. One is care: we recruit these kids into our program, take them off the streets, and keep them in our home outlets with a branch in most of the cities we\u2019re in.\n\n\u201cThey are then placed in some of the schools we partner with. And in a playful manner, they are introduced to tech and artistic skills, which is so important, because the idea is to equip them with skills that will empower them beyond the foundation. Something people can pay them for later on.\u201d\n\nSo far, the foundation has interacted with up to 15,000 children through different programmes.\n\n\u201cFor some of them, it\u2019s a one-off kind of interaction, like food drives. For others, it\u2019s school enrollment, people that we put in school. Because every year, we take hundreds of children to school. Like in 2020, it was about 500. This year, we\u2019re looking at a thousand already. We also have people benefitting from school projects we have done, and some from our coding tutors, as some of them go out to teach in schools.\u201d\n\nKids\u2019 innovation Hub and STEM bootcamps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, the foundation opened a Kids Innovation Hub to equip children with tech skills.\n\nThe process involves selecting children from charity homes, public schools, and low-income private schools; equipping them with digital skills by organising bootcamps; employing coders for teaching; occasionally inviting mentors to meet with the kids on demo days; and assess the teachers\u2019 methodologies.\n\nOjenike reveals that the hub also allows the children to embrace other creative skills beyond coding, emphasising that freedom of expression and exploration is encouraged.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show them their right to access the art and technology space. We encourage them to explore different activities beyond coding. Upon close monitoring, we discover their flairs and help them focus on their interests, be it design, drawing or digital illustrations.\u201d\n\nSince its launch, 445 children aged 6-18 have been introduced to tech. The fourth edition of the Kids\u2019 Innovation Hub STEM bootcamp was held from August 7 to August 21, 2021, in partnership with IngressiveForGood, a not-for-profit platform that trains youths in Africa with tech talents and connects them with jobs.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, there was a demo day, which saw attendance from a few key players in the African tech scene to mentor and encourage the children.\n\nConsidering the weight of what it takes to run a charity organisation, the foundation has a community of tech and non-tech volunteers, including coders, carers, teachers, cooks, social media managers, and administrators.\n\nTo volunteer, interested persons can send an application to destinytrust@org, stating the role they want to function in.\n\nCurrently located in Ibadan, and Igbo-Ora, Oyo State, and Lagos, Ojenike shares that each city comes with its unique problems which fit under their care, education and empowerment solution structure.\n\n\u201cSo, Lagos is where we started from. It\u2019s cosmopolitan, and you see all kinds of people here. The street children escaping parts of the country where insurgency is a real challenge end up in Lagos, and this is where we have a good number of homeless people. So our focus here is providing food, shelter and care, alongside education.\n\n\u201cAnd when you go on the streets, you also meet kids from the Southwest, who moved to Lagos from Ibadan, owing to promises of a better life. This is one of the reasons we opened a centre in Ibadan. In Igbo-Ora, almost anyone has a family compound to live in, so our focus there is education and empowerment.\u201d\n\nSustaining a charity foundation in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is the case with most charity organisations, funding is quite a challenge. Destiny Trust Children Foundation gets her funding from goodwill and volunteers. Ojenike shares that contributions from volunteers and their families make up most of their source of income.\n\n\u201cOur volunteers\u2019 community is actually really amazing. A very significant percentage of our income comes from our own members. At the time we did our midyear impact report, volunteers and their family members contributed 70% of what was spent from January to June.\u201d\n\nHe also adds that, for external funding, the foundation isn\u2019t running on any grants at the moment. The latest was received in 2019 due to a partnership with an organisation in Luxembourg to conduct a literacy program in Africa. Most of the time, after they applied for grants, their applications were rejected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve applied for grants and have been rejected a number of times. But we are not giving up. We are still trying. We know that the right opportunities will come. We\u2019ve learnt from things we didn\u2019t do right from previous applications, and we are trying to get a good sense of what the grants reviewers are looking out for, also looking out for organisations where our cause will be better appreciated.\u201d\n\nSome members of the foundation\u2019s board and management team include Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Vice-president of Nigeria; Mrs Ngozi Ken-Udochukwu, Lawyer and child development advocate; Mrs Foluke Irukera, early childhood education consultant; and Ol\u00fawat\u00f3s\u00ecn Olaseinde, Co-founder and CEO of MoneyAfrica, a subscription-based financial edtech platform,\n\nOlaseinde shares a bit of her journey with the foundation with Techpoint Africa. She heard about the foundation via Twitter and immediately applied to volunteer because the vision aligned with her passion for education, especially for underprivileged children.\n\n\u201cI reached out via a DM to schedule a visit to their home. There was so much warmth in the place. The children were joyful and relaxed. I could feel it. I joined immediately. Six months later, I joined the partnership team. It\u2019s a win-win for the children and the economy that we play a long term game by getting them education and developmental skills.\u201d\n\nGoing forward; plans for the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe need for creating access to education and skill acquisition for Africa\u2019s over 60 million out-of-school children and adolescents is not only vital but pressing. Abandoned and uneducated, these children are susceptible to being used as accomplices for several societal menaces due to lack of proper information and neglect.\n\nCommenting on this, a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes(PDF) reveals, \u201cThroughout the world, teenaged and young adult males commit most of the crime, and Africa\u2019s youthful population (43% under the age of 15) means that a greater part of the society falls into this pool of potential offenders. Many of these young people are not enrolled in educational programmes and cannot find employment.\u201d\n\nThis follows Ojenike\u2019s train of thought, and he believes that an expansion to more cities is not only necessary but urgent.\n\n\u201cWe want to be everywhere children need us. What we\u2019re doing now is only navigating the surface of the problem. We want to be able to replicate what we\u2019re doing in other states by setting up centres in new states for the school empowerment program. This year, we have set up two centres we are looking to strengthen and expand.\u201d\n\nThere is also a need for more teachers and computers for the Kids\u2019 Innovation Hubs in Lagos and Ibadan to foster paced and personalised learning. Ojenike also shares that the educational program is being expanded to over-aged children who have never been to school.\n\n\u201cFor somebody who is over 14 years old and has never been to school, how do you teach coding without first ensuring basic reading and writing skills? So, the plan is to open up new centres for overaged children. We are looking at the first of October to launch this special kind of school for accelerated education.\u201d\n\nAs with Chidiebere\u2019s case, the foundation has its shares of testimonies. Some of its alumni have grown after being equipped with skills to sustain themselves and make their way in the world, securing university education.\n\n\u201cSome of our kids are in the university. We have some of them in UI (University of Ibadan), Benson Idahosa University, and other places. For those who have gone through the innovation hub, we have a few in Unilag (University of Lagos), who were able to continue their own development in tech.\u201d\n\nFor Olaseinde, the best moments of being a part of the foundation are seeing the children grow up to set positive examples.\n\n\u201cThe joy of watching the children evolve. At the latest outreach, there was a girl that we re-integrated into the education system from our host community. She was at the forefront of the outreach. She has grown over the years and was a model example to the other children.\u201d\n\nThe continent is rife with challenges, but they provide room for innovation. You would agree with me that Africa is abundant with golden opportunities. And there is so much more than we can do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, a Nigerian-American was recognised for her innovative work advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in voice.\n\nThe attraction came from building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages, which was innovative. As of the time she founded the startup, the market was pretty undefined and unrefined, with no known player in the space focused on native African languages.\n\nTo get an idea of how it feels to get the attention of an organisation like Women in Voice (WiV) \u2014 an international non-profit based in Seattle \u2014 and her plans for it, we had a chat, albeit briefly.\n\nI did get an idea, but I only scratched the surface. I would come to realise that what seemed like a big deal was only a bit of the life of a hard-working woman with a problem-solving attitude, willing to keep shattering glass ceilings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, Abake Adenle got to know of my interest in a broader conversation, and she gladly obliged.\n\nOn the set Monday evening, I noticed she had a relaxed look that set the tone for what was to be an exciting conversation. We kicked off as casually as it gets with small talks.\n\n\u201cWho is Abake Adenle?\u201d felt like the simplest conversation starter I could think of. And I guess I made the right call because 15 minutes into the virtual chat, I could already picture how one stage of life blended seamlessly into the next.\n\nBut was I wrong? I wish I wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relatively content with how my life has evolved. There have certainly been challenges, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be challenges ahead, but I try to take a stoic approach and just let it go.\u201d She paused to refer to the popular Disney sensation, Frozen, before she continued her train of thought, \u201cyou can only plan so much. I think the whole thing is to be flexible, proactive, and responsive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle. Source: Supplied\n\nAbake could have been an academic professor \u2014 which she says she never lost the thrill for \u2014 but she chose the practical world of finance. With lots of experience in the bag, she checked out years later in pursuit of another adventure.\n\nCurrently, she is wading the waters of entrepreneurship while running a startup with a lean team. And she didn\u2019t hide how much she enjoys doing what she does.\n\nIn the world of entrepreneurship\n\n\u201cDo you miss your 9 to 5?\u201d I asked, teasing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe blurted, \u201cNo!\u201d amidst chuckles, adding comments about how much she enjoys the flexibility she now has.\n\nIf we ignore her inability to enjoy the work-life balance she craved, Abake never had a problem with investment banking \u2014 her first foray into the business world \u2014 as the commitment required could have happened in other careers.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of owning my time. I also enjoy intellectual freedom. I\u2019m working on something I want to work on,\u201d with an emphasis on the later \u2018I\u2019, \u201cnot because I\u2019ve been told to work on it, but because I actually enjoy working on it. This is something I value.\u201d\n\nFor her, being an entrepreneur is more fluid as it allows her to consider other things and probably pivot. In comparison, with investment banking where she had a core thing to focus on.\n\nGrowing up like the average Jane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI think I probably belong to the group of Nigerians that have lived in lots of different places but always having Nigeria as their anchor.\u201d\n\nAbake was born in the US, but she lived her first six years in Ibadan and partly Lagos, Nigeria, before going back. At age 11, she came back to the Motherland for her secondary school studies.\n\nBy 16, she returned to the US, where she studied Electrical Engineering for her undergraduate studies at Morgan State University, Maryland, before going for a PhD programme in the United Kingdom.\n\nBecause Abake enjoys studying, and she felt her knowledge of hardware was not as much as she would like, she decided to do a PhD degree in Signal Processing with a focus on Bayesian Inference from Cambridge University, graduating with good grades.\n\nAt that time, there was an attraction towards the finance industry, so she transitioned from engineering to work at Morgan Stanley, a global investment bank. There, she worked as a quantitative strategist.\n\n\u201cMy role was to design and develop trading strategies for institutional investors. And I did that for about eight years.\u201d\n\nI joked about guessing why she ditched engineering as an opportunity to work with companies that hold a lot of capital. In her role, she found ways to help large companies into insurance, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset management and implement investment ideas.\n\nShe agreed her time in investment banking helped hone her expertise in business while acquiring commercial skills and ideas, something she wouldn\u2019t have learned in academia.\n\nReferring to her parents\u2019 massive involvement in her life, Abake says her informed foundation continues to play an essential role in the values she holds dear.\n\n\u201cThey set a very good example for us in terms of being hardworking, being open-minded, and not being afraid to pursue new opportunities, new ideas and adventures.\u201d\n\nAs the last of four children, she mainly owes her love for reading and mathematics to her mum, who made her and her siblings study more while encouraging a reading culture.\n\nAlthough Abake said that she had never wanted to go into academia, she seemed to me more like a teacher.\n\nReminding her after she carefully delineated the concept of Signal Processing and Bayesian Inference and its applicability in investment banking and everyday life, she eventually agreed with me.\n\n\u201cA lot of the work I was doing was going with salespeople to meet with, like, the Chief Investment Officer of this sovereign wealth fund or the head of that asset management fund. These are people who were very senior, who may not be experts at math. So I quickly had to learn that you can\u2019t spend all your time describing things in ways that nobody understands what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nJourney into the startup scene\n\nDuring Abake\u2019s eight years at Morgan Stanley, she developed a mobile app for learning Yoruba, the Speak Yoruba App. It was never part of her plans, but she was inspired after seeing her niece and nephew use an app for learning English alphabets.\n\n\u201cAnd it ended up doing well in the app store.\u201d That was both surprising and gratifying, but she couldn\u2019t do more due to her schedule.\n\n\u201cI received lots of requests from people asking me to make a version of the app for the African language that they spoke, which was nice and was something I thought I could go into. But I had a job where I was working from 8 am to 11 pm, and it wasn\u2019t realistic to take on at that time.\u201d\n\nI wondered where the mind to build stuff randomly came from, and Abake hinted that aside from how she\u2019s weirdly drawn to studying and solving problems, she enjoyed making houses out of books as a young child.\n\nIn addition to that, a particular course during her undergraduate studies \u2014 where they were challenged to build something from an idea \u2014 was a trigger.\n\nSoon, the time came when Abake finally decided to find a new challenge. Although she had several ideas, she settled with running a business of her own. At that point, she had the opportunity to pitch to Innovate UK for a grant, so she decided to revive the Yoruba-learning app, which is now no longer available on the app store.\n\n\u201cThis was probably like four years on from when I\u2019d launched the app. And I didn\u2019t think the app itself was substantial enough of an idea to pitch for a grant. Before then, I\u2019d be thinking about adding features that would require voice recognition and speech synthesis.\u201d\n\nGiven how untapped speech technology for the African languages market was as of 2017, there were uncertainties. In September 2017, she got the Innovate UK grant.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan for the grant?\n\n\u201cIt was for me to develop voice recognition and speech synthesis along with an implementation of a product with two African languages. So, I developed a Beta One for Yoruba and Swahili.\n\n\u201cWe developed a male Swahili voice, and three female Yoruba voices, one of which was based on my voice speaking Yoruba. Also, we developed our core voice recognition model along with a couple of variants that were content-specific voice recognition models for Yoruba and Swahili.\u201d\n\nShe confirmed her fluency in Yoruba didn\u2019t only come from her stay in Nigeria as her parents played their part.\n\nAll that went on for a year. In the meantime, she still consulted in the finance space while looking for funding, but VCs weren\u2019t forthcoming given the undefined nature of the African speech recognition market.\n\nOn the other hand, having hands-on experience in the investment space, she was cautious of investment proposals that would take away most of her control in the business.\n\nBootstrapping for another six months, she went with a bigger proposal to Innovate UK, where the business got up to $500,000 in seed fund. With that, they could expand the beta product offering from a language perspective and use it to build data resources.\n\n\u201cAs of now, even though we\u2019re still in private beta, we still have the broadest native African language coverage.\u201d\n\nCompared to when she started, she\u2019s confident in the attention the market now gets. And global companies are also looking to partner, giving it prospects for commercial viability.\n\nOf wild interests and everything in between\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle. Source: Supplied\n\nFor Abake, it has not only been investment banking, engineering, and entrepreneurship.\n\nInterestingly, she didn\u2019t always have an idea of a career to pursue. At some point, she considered management consulting because a family friend was excelling at it.\n\nThen at another time, medicine. But, she changed her mind after an opportunity to scrub in during a surgery at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine during an undergraduate internship.\n\nAbake believes investment banking was better suited to her background and interests. But she\u2019s quick to add that despite having good grades and being hardworking, she has always been privileged to find herself in favourable situations. But in it all, she\u2019s content.\n\nAbake cannot deny that she had exciting moments at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cThere was a period where I came up with a strategy which worked across multiple environments. And it was ultimately adopted by a very large European asset manager who was somewhat difficult to deal with. I ended up developing a very good relationship with him and his team.\u201d\n\nThis is one of her high points, building something unique, innovative, delivering value, and commercially viable.\n\nBut it was more than that.\n\nAbake also experienced racism even though she has always worked in the UK.\n\nHere\u2019s a funny story: Even though she occupied a role very few black women find themselves in, sometimes, she was thought to be a secretary. But she wasn\u2019t deterred by that.\n\n\u201cI think that even though it\u2019s important to acknowledge these things, it is also important not to dwell too much on them. Otherwise, you become burdened with examining misogyny and racism, rather than being effective and productive.\u201d\n\nAs an entrepreneur, she\u2019s had to deal with trying to enter mutually beneficial partnerships and getting the right set of people to key into her goals, challenges startups often face at any face of the business life cycle.\n\nAsides from reading, Abake enjoys cooking, travelling, and spending time with friends and family. Although all these are asides other random interests, she would pick but hardly follow through with. However, in a way I find intriguing, she finds fun in exploring wild and varied interests, one of the reasons she enjoys being an entrepreneur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFlat6Labs\u2019 seed fund\n\nMoove Africa\u2019s Cape Town expansion\n\nINEC\u2019s stance on electronically transmitting results\n\nYellow Card\u2019s Series A\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The newsletter edition dated September 7, 2021 reported that OPay was involved in a money-laundering scandal. That was based on a story by The Africa Report from September 3, 2021. The Africa Report has taken down the story and we have done the same.\n\nYesterday, we promised an article on Twitter\u2019s new \u2018Tip\u2019 feature. We delivered, and you can read the full story on our website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead now: Twitter\u2019s new tipping feature could make spending Bitcoin attractive.\n\nFlat6Labs raises $10m seed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlat6Labs team\n\nMore funding for Tunisian startups: Venture capital firm, Flat6Labs has announced the close of its Tunisian fund, Anava Seed Fund (ASF). In the process, it also increased the size of the fund from $3 million to $10 million. This follows the firm\u2019s recent $13 million fund for Egyptian startups.\n\nThe Anava Seed Fund was launched in 2017 in partnership with the Tunisian American Enterprise Fund, BIAT Bank, and Meninx Holding to invest in 75 Tunisian startups in five years. So far, the ASF has invested in over 50 Tunisian startups and created over 500 jobs.\n\nWhat does Flat6Labs do? Launched in 2011, Flat6Labs is one of the leading VC firms in the MENA region, having made over 300 investments. With ticket sizes ranging between $50k and $500k, the firm supports early-stage startups.\n\nFor this fund, Sawari Ventures joins the round, having invested $1.6 million. Wael Amin, Managing Partner at Sawari Ventures, said, \u201cWe are very proud of our investment in the Anava Seed Fund as we have closely followed their progress and are more than convinced that Tunisia has talented entrepreneurs working on promising start-ups.\u201d\n\nRamez El-Serafy, CEO of Flat6Labs, revealed the fund\u2019s belief in the region\u2019s untapped potential while confirming that the firm intends to extend its impact in the North African region together with its partners.\n\nNorth African startups have seen significant interest this year, already surpassing the $145 million they raised in 2020 within the first half of 2021.\n\nWith a young population and growing mobile phone penetration, the region has seen investors jostling for a piece of the pie. In addition to Flat6Labs, Dubai-based venture capital firm, Nuwa Capital has raised $100 million to invest in startups in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoove launches in Cape Town\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoove\u2019s founders, Jide Odunsi and Ladi Delano\n\nMobility fintech startup, Moove has announced its launch in South Africa\u2019s second-largest city, Cape Town. In the process, it became the fourth African city and the second South African city where the startup has launched since opening shop in 2019. This development follows its $23 million Series A round in August.\n\nSinako Cetwiye, South Africa Country Manager for Moove, hinted at plans for further launches in South Africa. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been operating in South Africa for four months, but it\u2019s an excellent market with huge demand for our product.\n\n\u201cThe next phase for Cape Town and the rest of the country is to grow our sign-ups, revenue, and trips so that we can empower more South Africans to become mobility entrepreneurs and earn a living in safe, new vehicles,\u201d she said.\n\nThe launch is not the only major development for the startup with new faces on its leadership team.

This position was stated in a paper released on Saturday, September 25, 2021, in Abuja.\n\nPer Premium Times, the electoral body expressed its belief that most Nigerians support electronically transmitting results while stating that it would improve the quality of election results management.\n\nIn July, we reported that the House of Representatives had questioned the National Communications Commission (NCC) over the suitability of electronic devices for electronically transmitting results.\n\nAt the hearing, Ubale Maska, Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, cited low Internet coverage in the country as a hindrance to electronically transmitted results.\n\nINEC\u2019s paper thus casts doubts over the NCC\u2019s recommendation as it states that there is adequate technology and national infrastructure to support the electronic transmission of results.\n\n\u201cThe technology and national infrastructure to support this are adequate. Consequently, if the choice was up to INEC, the commission prefers to transmit election results electronically once the necessary legal framework is provided,\u201d the paper said.\n\nReacting to the argument that the Internet infrastructure is inadequate for the process, the paper stated that conversations between INEC, mobile network operators (MNOs) and the NCC prove that.\n\nIt further said that a joint committee of INEC and NCC had been established ahead of the 2019 elections, with the committee concluding that electronic transmission of results was possible.\n\nWith electoral malpractice and violence frequently characterising elections in the country, the electronic transmission of results has been hailed by many as a necessary step in sanitising the electoral process.\n\nYellow Card\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nPan-African cryptocurrency exchange Yellow Card has raised $15 million from Valar Ventures, Third Prime, Castle Island Ventures, Square, Coinbase Ventures and Blockchain.com Ventures in its Series A round.\n\nFounded by Chris Maurice and Justin Poiroux, the startup provides a way for users to buy and sell bitcoin in 12 countries across Africa, including Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Botswana.\n\nTo drive adoption, the startup tailors its strategy to each country it operates in, using local systems. In Nigeria, for example, it began with an agency-banking model that financial institutions have used to reach under-served populations.\n\nThe startup plans to use its fresh funding to grow its team, launch new products, and expand to new African countries.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow do influencers make money?

          "text": "Not less than 20 fishermen were killed accidentally in a Nigerian military strike on a jihadist camp in northeast Nigeria, AFP reported on Monday, quoting two security sources and locals.\n\nThe report, quoting sources, said a Nigerian fighter jet early on Sunday bombarded Kwatar Daban Masara in Lake Chad, which straddles Nigeria and neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nThe area is a bastion for the IS-affiliated Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThe reports of casualties came less than two weeks after officials say another airstrike on a village killed nine civilians in Nigeria\u2019s northeast where the military is battling a 12-year Islamist insurgency, AFP reported.\n\nISWAP recently lifted a ban on fishermen in its territory, allowing them to move in and fish in the freshwater lake for a fee. That led to an influx of fisherman who had abandoned the area.\n\n\u201cAny fisherman that goes to that area does so at his own risk because it is an enemy territory and there is no way of differentiating them from the terrorists,\u201d one local intelligence source said.\n\n\u201cFrom the information we have been receiving the death toll is much higher than 20.\u201d\n\nLocal fisherman Labo Sani told AFP by telephone that the jet strike hit Kwatar Daban Masara at around 6 am (0500 GMT), killing around 20 fishermen.\n\nKwatar Daban Masara which is on the shores of the lake is the \u201cgateway to ISWAP\u2019s camps on several islands\u201d and a supply route for the jihadists, said Sani from nearby Daban Masara.\n\nAnother fisherman, Sallau Arzika, said the fighter jet struck the village \u201ckilling many of our people who are there for fishing\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe initial death toll was around 20, but the figure has been increasing with the deaths of many of the injured,\u201d Arzika said.\n\nNews of the incident was slow the emerge due to limited telecommunications in the region.\n\nA Nigerian air force spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking confirmation or comment.\n\nThe intelligence source who works with anti-jihadist militia in the region said the strike was based on \u201ccredible information\u201d of a gathering of ISWAP fighters in the village since Wednesday.\n\nHe said aerial surveillance and reports from other sources revealed terrorists were amassing in Kwatar Daban Masara and it was obvious they were planning an attack, the source said.\n\n\u2018Preemptive strike\u2019\n\nAccording to another security source, the village was subjected to surveillance in the past 10 days after scores of men suspected to be foreign fighters arrived in several vehicles and were ferried to camps inside the lake.\n\n\u201cIt was a preemptive strike to destroy whatever plans the terrorists were making,\u201d said the security source.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect an innocent civilian to be at that location and whoever is found is certainly part of the terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nOn September 16 a Nigerian airstrike on a village in nearby Yobe state killed at least nine civilian residents, according to officials.\n\nThe Nigerian air force said at the time its fighter jet was pursuing a group of jihadists in the area and it was investigating the incident.\n\nSince 2009, Nigeria\u2019s armed forces have battled a grinding jihadist insurrection in the northeast that has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced nearly two million from their homes.\n\nThe conflict spilled into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to end the violence.\n\nIn January 2017 at least 112 people were killed when a fighter jet struck a camp housing 40,000 people displaced by violence in Rann near the border with Cameroon.\n\nThe Nigerian military blamed \u201clack of appropriate marking of the area\u201d for the bombardment in a report it issued six months later.\n\nIn July 2019 at least 13 civilians were killed when a Nigerian fighter jet hit Gajiganna village, 50 kilometres from Borno state capital Maiduguri, as it targeted fleeing jihadists after they attacked a nearby base.",

Obviously, the elite will survive in any way but the vast majority of our people will not.\n\n\u201cSo, I will urge that we should as much as possible do whatever we can in our spaces that we occupy to keep emphasizing that we cannot afford a situation where the national unity of this country is compromised or where the country is made the theater of conflict and all sorts of insurgencies and crimes.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, the president of the union, Isiguzo, commended the initiatives of the Buhari regime in the areas of employment opportunity creation, skills training for the youth, among others.\n\nHe said in acknowledgment of its role in the society, the union has over the years \u201cengaged in training and retraining of Journalists with assistance from various development partners to build capacity of journalists to effectively bring to public attention humanitarian situations in the country in a fair manner, honestly, and constructively.\u201d\n\nIsiguzo noted that the union frowned against fake news and would do everything in its powers to check the menace, calling on \u201cjournalists to be careful not to be tempted into propagating fake news by ensuring proper and adequate checks before stories are written and transmitted for public consumption.\u201d",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nYouth groups in Ebonyi South Senatorial district under the auspices of Ebonyi South Youth Congress (ESYC), have kicked against suggestions in some quarters that the state governorship seat has been zoned to the Abakaliki bloc, comprising of Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central Senatorial Zones.\n\nThe group which took the position in a communique signed by its president, Uka Ibom Anya and issued after its emergency meeting held in Abakaliki, Monday, addressed particularly, a statement attributed to the Caretaker Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Elder Fred Udogu, where he was quoted to have stated that the party has zoned the governorship seat to Abakaliki bloc.\n\nThe ESYC argued that there is no longer anything called Abakaliki bloc or Afikpo bloc, as according to it, the state is now divided into three senatorial districts.\n\nIt accused those promoting the idea of Abakaliki bloc of plotting to instigate divisions in the state.\n\nThe communique said, \u201cThat the attention of Ebonyi South Youth Congress has been drawn to the interview granted to some journalists on 23rd September, 2021 in Abakaliki by the Caretaker Chairman of the PDP, Elder Fred Udogu, where he was quoted to have stated that the PDP has zoned the 2023 Governorship seat to Abakaliki bloc, made up of Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central Senatorial Zones.\n\n\u201cSince we read the news report in the newspapers, we went on to make enquires as to the authenticity of the report. Our finding is that no such decision was taken at any meeting or organ of the party. Maybe, the Caretaker Chairman was merely expressing his personal opinion on the matter and not necessarily the official position of the party.\n\n\u201cWe, the members of the Youth Congress reiterate our position that it will be wrong for the PDP to zone the Governorship position to two zones in the state, namely, the Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central Senatorial zones without considering the fate of Ebonyi South Senatorial district. There is nothing like Abakaliki Block or Afikpo Bloc.\n\n\u201cThe two blocs existed momentarily after Ebonyi state was created in 1996. On the creation of Ebonyi state, Abakaliki block had six LGAs while Afikpo block had four LGAs. Shortly afterwards, three new LGAs, namely Ebonyi, Ezza North and Ivo were created and the state was split into three Senatorial Zones. Anybody talking of two blocks of Abakaliki and Afikpo now is introducing sectionalism into the state.\u201d\n\nThe youth group emphasized that since 1996, the politics of the state has been based on Zoning in the three Senatorial districts.\n\nIt therefore, urged leaders of the state and Ebonyi people in general \u201cto be vigilant at all times and not to allow agents of confusion to destroy the state by resorting to archaic zoning formulae.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the Governorship slot should be thrown open to the three Senatorial districts or we go back to Ebonyi North where the zoning started in 1999.\n\n\u201cThe PDP in Ebonyi state should adopt all measures that would bring all parts of the state together, to ensure unity, justice and equity in the state.\u201d",

I later took a bold step and approached a neighbour who works with NTA and told him that I would love to go to work with him and he agreed. So every morning I will join him to work with no pay but because of the passion. I have no other choice than to endure all I went through. That was how I came into the industry.\n\nAs a top director, which was your first film?\n\nMy first move was shot in 1998 and titled Faceless, I shot that movie as a student.\n\nAnd like how many movies do you have in your kitty as top director?\n\nTo be honest with you I have lost count.\n\nWhat would you say is the biggest challenge facing Nollywood currently?\n\nClique and tribalism. As a director if you are not able to fall into a clique, it will be very difficult for you to showcase your directing skills and that is very unhealthy for the industry. Many directors are wasted talent due to clique\u2019s situations in the industry.\n\nTribalism is one of the bacteria\u2019s destroying the industry and I will give you an instance, which was my own experience. I was handling a project owned by another tribe\u2019s man. It was a new project so no fund, he begged me to direct the project for him with little payment. I took pity on him and I also love to encourage people with beautiful projects. Eventually the project started getting sponsors and his tribe\u2019s people started advising him to drop me and pick someone from their tribe which he did and I left. Two years later, the project was dead and buried due to nepotism.\n\nWhat makes a good director?\n\nA good director is someone with a third eye, communication skills, confidence, discipline and good judgement.\n\nHave you ever been harassed sexually by desperate actresses on set?\n\nIt\u2019s usual in the entertainment world because most ladies are desperate to make it to the limelight.\n\nDo you think the government has done enough to support Nollywood?\n\nGovernment has not done enough to support Nollywood especially this current administration. They do not care about the existence of Nigerian movie industry. Lack of government support is very visible in Nollywood currently. They have done nothing to assist the Nigerian film industry. Only the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan initiated the N3billion naira intervention fund for the industry.\n\nEven at that it was not channelled to the appropriate quarters; it became a clique thing that destroyed the concept of the project. Nigerian government needs to understand the power of movie making just like America and other countries who understand the economic values of movie making. I urge government to take serious interest in the activities of movie makers to help tackle some national challenges. Their support is also needed to ensure the growth of the industry.\n\nAs a director what is your biggest achievement in Nollywood?\n\nBeing able to assist some emerging talents to achieve their dreams\n\nWhat would say is the biggest challenge facing directors in Nollywood today?\n\nClique.

The perpetrator engaged the child in sexual activity when she was seven years old, on two occasions.\n\n\u201cOn the 19th of April 2021, he sexually harassed her, touching her body. He told her: \u2018I touched you some years back, you are so grown, so developed. Do you have a boyfriend?

          "text": "Two security sources and residents told AFP on Monday that at least 20 fisherman were killed accidently in a Nigerian military strike on a terrorist base in northeast Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the sources, a Nigerian fighter jet bombarded Kwatar Daban Masara on Lake Chad, which crosses Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. The IS-affiliated Islamic State West Africa Province has a stronghold in the area (ISWAP).\n\nOfficials claim another bombing on a community in Nigeria\u2019s northeast, where the military is fighting a 12-year Islamist insurgency, killed nine civilians less than two weeks ago.\n\nISWAP recently overturned a ban on fishermen entering its area, enabling them to enter for a fee to fish in the freshwater lake. As a result, a large number of fishermen who had previously abandoned the area returned.\n\n\u201cAny fisherman that goes to that area does so at his own risk because it is an enemy territory and there is no way of differentiating them from the terrorists,\u201d one local intelligence source said.\n\n\u201cFrom the information we have been receiving the death toll is much higher than 20.\u201d\n\nLocal fisherman Labo Sani told AFP by telephone that the jet strike hit Kwatar Daban Masara at around 6 am (0500 GMT), killing around 20 fishermen.\n\nKwatar Daban Masara which is on the shores of the lake is the \u201cgateway to ISWAP\u2019s camps on several islands\u201d and a supply route for the jihadists, said Sani from nearby Daban Masara.\n\nAnother fisherman, Sallau Arzika, said the fighter jet struck the village \u201ckilling many of our people who are there for fishing\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe initial death toll was around 20, but the figure has been increasing with the deaths of many of the injured,\u201d Arzika said.\n\nNews of the incident was slow the emerge due to limited telecommunications in the region.\n\nA Nigerian air force spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking confirmation or comment.\n\nThe intelligence source who works with anti-jihadist militia in the region said the strike was based on \u201ccredible information\u201d of a gathering of ISWAP fighters in the village since Wednesday.\n\nHe said aerial surveillance and reports from other sources revealed terrorists were amassing in Kwatar Daban Masara and it was obvious they were planning an attack, the source said.\n\n\u2018Preemptive strike\u2019\n\nAccording to another security source, the village was subjected to surveillance in the past 10 days after scores of men suspected to be foreign fighters arrived in several vehicles and were ferried to camps inside the lake.\n\n\u201cIt was a preemptive strike to destroy whatever plans the terrorists were making,\u201d said the security source.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect an innocent civilian to be at that location and whoever is found is certainly part of the terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nOn September 16 a Nigerian airstrike on a village in nearby Yobe state killed at least nine civilian residents, according to officials.\n\nThe Nigerian air force said at the time its fighter jet was pursuing a group of jihadists in the area and it was investigating the incident.\n\nSince 2009, Nigeria\u2019s armed forces have battled a grinding jihadist insurrection in the northeast that has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced nearly two million from their homes.\n\nThe conflict spilled into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to end the violence.\n\nIn January 2017 at least 112 people were killed when a fighter jet struck a camp housing 40,000 people displaced by violence in Rann near the border with Cameroon.\n\nThe Nigerian military blamed \u201clack of appropriate marking of the area\u201d for the bombardment in a report it issued six months later.\n\nIn July 2019 at least 13 civilians were killed when a Nigerian fighter jet hit Gajiganna village, 50 kilometres from Borno state capital Maiduguri, as it targeted fleeing jihadists after they attacked a nearby base.",

          "text": "Obi\u2019s case attracted me as a seasoned criminal journalist in Virginia, as I questioned how a successful businessman who adorned the front pages of multiple business journals ended up in jail.\n\nI invited Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, to a prison interview, which he graciously accepted. Obi greeted me with a solid handshake, a confident smile, and the charisma of someone very intelligent on a hot warm August day. As he begins his 10-year prison sentence, I conducted an interview with him to learn more about his background, views, and regrets.\n\nHi Obi, thanks for accepting this interview, how are you doing?\n\nI am doing very well thank you, I am alive and healthy which I always give thanks for.\n\nHow is your reality now you have started serving your 10-year sentence?\n\nThe transition from the outside world to prison is hard but I have to face the music. I did what I did and I accept the consequences. I am just making sure I become a better man day by day.\n\nLet\u2019s go back a bit, how would you describe Nigeria growing up?\n\nNigeria is great when you are young and naive but when you become old enough to fend for yourself you quickly realize that Nigeria is a hazardous obstacle course that most will never navigate their way through. Nigeria is a beautiful country but poverty is too widespread and you can\u2019t rely on the government for help but you have to find your own way. Basic needs such as 24 hours electricity is unheard of, fuel scarcity is common, inflation is high and many are dying of hunger. Most Nigerians are in a state of desperation.\n\nHow did the journey to the frauds you are accused of come about?\n\nI was doing a little here and there but the level changed through this one particular friend I used to look up to. I visited him one day and he was living very comfortably with three new cars and a huge house at a young age. When at his house I noticed him on a website www.vionz.to that was selling crypto and bank logins. I asked him about the website and he showed me that he buys bank and crypto logins from there and easily withdraws above $20,000 at a time, that\u2019s how he was funding his lifestyle. In 15 minutes he demonstrated it to me and from there I tried it myself when I got home. After successfully doing my first transfer so easily it was hard to stop after that. From there I got introduced to other money-making schemes that got me where I am today.\n\nHow much money have you made from fraud?\n\nI didn\u2019t really keep count, I am a very ambitious person in anything I do regarding money. I believe I will always be an overachiever.\n\nAccording to your case charges, you made $11 million?\n\nThen there\u2019s your answer, you already know the details.\n\nPeople compare you to Hushpuppi (Abbas Ramon) who is also facing jail if found guilty, what are your thoughts?\n\nIt\u2019s insulting, I and Hushpuppi are not on the same level. Hushpuppi could never achieve what I achieved. He cannot run a business and we are not similar in any way. He was out to please the crowd, I was out to change lives, create jobs, and conquer the business world. I have done so much for my community back home with my charity foundation, which lives has he helped? Nobody.\n\nIt sounds like you dislike Hushppupi?\n\nNo, I have never met him, but I just find the continued comparison very annoying. Our impact on the world is very different. I have made a much more positive contribution to society than he has.\n\nWhat do you miss most about the outside life?\n\nI miss being in business, I was a workaholic and most of my joy came from growing my businesses bigger and bigger. I miss family too and of miss my daughter.\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nOf course, I do, if I was a little more patient I could have achieved everything I achieved in business by not rushing to get startup capital the way I did, however, hopefully, I can be a lesson to the younger generation that may be tempted to take the quick route in life.\n\nWhat\u2019s your advice to the youth of Nigeria?\n\nPick your role models wisely, look up to great leaders and people of good character that look after their communities and families. Believe and you will achieve. Also, remember life is a marathon, not a sprint.",

According to the reports, unidentified gunmen attacked Madamai village in Kaura local government.\n\n\u201cThe troops mobilised to the location and also came under fire, before forcing the assailants to withdraw after an intense exchange. Some houses were set ablaze by the attackers at one end of the village. The troops put out the fire at three of the burning houses, and rescued six locals from the infernos.\n\n\u201cAs of the time of this update, 34 residents have been confirmed dead following the attack. Seven others sustained injuries, and were rushed to a hospital in Plateau state.\n\n\u201cGovernor (Nasir) el-Rufai has stated that the Kaduna state government will bear the full cost of injured victims\u2019 treatment.\n\n\u201cGovernor el-Rufai was briefed by security agencies on the roles played by the Chief of Kagoro, HRH Chief Ufuwai Bonet and the member representing Kaura Federal Constituency, Rt. Hon. Gideon Gwani in dousing the tension and preventing a breakdown of law and order, following the unfortunate incident. The Governor commended their efforts and sterling leadership.\n\n\u201cThe governor ordered an urgent assessment of the area by the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency, towards the provision of succour to the affected households. The Governor received the reports with intense grief, and expressed his condemnation of the gruesome attack, which he described as an unspeakable display of wickedness, meriting the severest form of punishment.\n\n\u201cHe sent his deepest condolences to the families of the deceased, and the affected communities, as he prayed for the repose of their souls. He appealed for calm and charged security agencies to intensify their efforts in the campaign against the gratuitous killing of innocent citizens. He further tasked security agencies to ensure urgent and precise investigations into the horrific incident.\n\n\u201cAt this time, two suspects are being questioned in connection with the attack.

          "text": "The debate around the zoning of the presidency ahead of the 2023 elections continued Monday with the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) condemning their southern counterparts over their stance on power shift.\n\nThe NSGF\u2019s position was reached at the end of its meeting with traditional rulers from the region in Kaduna.\n\nReading the 11-point resolution at the end of the meeting, NSGF Chairman, Plateau state Governor Simon Bako Lalong said notwithstanding the position of some northern governors on rotational presidency, the action of the southern top politicians was \u201ccounter-productive, especially as it negates the position of the constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Forum observed that some Northern State Governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three Geo-Political zones in the South to promote unity and peace in the Nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemns the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South.\n\n\u201cThe statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected President shall score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation. In the case of run-up simple majority wins the election,\u201d the governors said.\n\nOpen grazing\n\nOn the ban on open grazing, the Forum asked the federal government to \u201cexpedite action on the well-established National Livestock Transformation Programme as a springboard in transiting from the open grazing system as widely practised in the North.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing Value Added Tax (VAT) debacle, they said: \u201cThe judgement of the Federal High Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13% derivation, National Economic Development Council and many others currently levied and collected by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State Government had enacted their VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum has expressed support for this course of action.\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by these state governments as sales tax. If every state enacted its VAT Law, multiple taxations will result in increases in prices of goods and services and collapse in interstate trade. VAT is not a production tax like excise, but a terminal tax that is paid by the ultimate consumer.\n\n\u201cThe reason Lagos accounts for our 50% VAT collection is that most of the telecommunication companies, Banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in Lagos with the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT.\n\n\u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgement on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is subjudice and the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum would respect this,\u201d they said.\n\nOn security, the Forum observed the need for a sustained synergy and coordinated efforts between the federal and northern state governments while noting the success of recent measures.\n\nThey commended the ongoing onslaught against banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram, especially in the North-east and parts of North-west and the North-central states, and encouraged the Armed Forces and other security agencies to sustain the tempo to bring an end to the menace.\n\nThe Forum also decried the \u201chigh level of conspiracies\u201d being perpetrated by some judicial officers in releasing/granting bail to arrested criminals,\u201d saying, \u201csuch sabotages the fight against criminality, hence, the need to develop \u2018good and robust intelligence mechanism\u2019 amongst states was identified as a panacea.\u201d\n\nPosition not in national interest\n\nA human rights activist in Ondo state, Barrister Morakinyo Ogele has described the outcome of the northern governors and traditional rulers\u2019 meeting as not for the best interest of the nation.\n\nOgele posited that the position of the governors and traditional rulers on issues like zoning of presidency, though not totally constitutional, as being stipulated by the forum, would do harm to the complexities of the nation\u2019s challenges, adding that this issue has always been addressed politically and resolved.\n\nWhile commenting on VAT, Ogele noted that since the matter is before the law court, it is prejudicial discussion on the matter.\n\nOgele, however, implored the forum to jettison ethnicity and join hands with their counterparts across the country at stamping out insecurity that has now been a nightmare to the citizenry, irrespective of their geo-political zones.",

It is for this reason that we as leaders of conscience are quite worried that elections in Nigeria have been riddled with malpractices and rigging since the inception of the present civilian rule in Nigeria, thereby making majority of Nigerian citizens to loose faith in the Nigerian democracy as well as the Nigerian State leading to appathy and sabotage.\n\nThe unfortunate flaws and pitfalls of the Nigeria electoral system have greatly eroded the legitimacy of the Nigerian State to the extent that seemingly elected governments are presently contending with different forms of political instability, insecurity and sabotage orchestrated by the governed, having failed to provide good governance and dividends of democracy for the majority of the citizens, owing to crisis of stolen mandate and inept leadership foisted by rigged elections. However, our investigations and national consultations have revealed that one major factor and alibi for electoral malpractices and rigging in Nigeria is the manual/physical transfer of election results in Nigeria, which is archaic, problematic and prone to abuse and infractions.\n\nConsequently, Stakeholders across party divides and sectional lines, including the elections management body, INEC have come to a Consensus that the country is ripe and due for electronic transmission of election results to overcome at least 50% of the basis for electoral malpractices in Nigeria. But some powerful lawmakers in the National Assembly and their sponsors, who are the greatest beneficiaries of the current manipulable election results transfer mode, have decided to constitute a barrier to yearnings and aspirations of majority of Nigerians for the country to adopt electronic transmission of election results for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe event will be attended by Other prominent Nigerians, Statesmen and members of the Civil Society.",

For instance, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa account for about a third of the incubators and accelerators and 80 per cent of investment on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough this is not the only measure of entrepreneurship, there are reasons to explain why some countries push ahead faster with startups, ecosystem development, and commercialisation. In the cases of these four countries, their economies and populations are larger than most African countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe four countries that show the greatest investment in startups generally have higher FDI and are among the few countries able to access the limited portfolio investment that is made in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa ranked as the top three countries on the continent in terms of attracting FDI over the past decade. They also tend to dominate the African portfolio investment market.\u201d\n\nFDI is an investment or a purchase of an interest in a company by a company or an investor located outside its borders. It is thus distinguished from a foreign portfolio investment by a notion of direct control.\n\nIt\u2019s a business decision to acquire a substantial stake in a foreign business or to buy it outright in order to expand its operations to a new region.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

INEC declared that it was not subordinate to the National Communication Commission (NCC) or answerable to any government agency.\n\nIn a similar development, former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, advised members of the Joint Conference Committee of the National Assembly to move fast in considering the different versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill passed by both chambers and let their decisions be guided only by national interest.\n\nThat was as the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, a coalition of over 70 organisations, asked the Senate to quickly resolve the conflicting aspects of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill so as to save the country from long-drawn litigations and uncertainty, which could put INEC\u2019s preparations for the elections in jeopardy.\n\nINEC called on the Senate and House of Representatives to quickly amend Sections 63, 65 and other relevant sections of the Electoral Act, which bar the commission from collation of election results electronically. It insisted that electronic transmission of results was doable, and it would guarantee safety, honesty and transparency.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, insisted that the electronic transmission of results real time was the best guarantee of transparency.\n\nSpeaking in a television programme monitored in Abuja on Monday, Okoye said INEC was determined to use electronic devices to improve Nigeria\u2019s electoral process, and deliver free, fair and credible elections. Okoye said for such to become a reality, the National Assembly must show courage by amending the relevant sections of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough INEC is increasingly tilting towards the use of technology to deliver a free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria, we want the National Assembly to amend the law, which prescribed the method elections are being conducted at the moment.\u201d\n\nOkoye admitted that INEC was still using the manual method, as enshrined in the Electoral Act, by collating election results from the Polling Units (PU), using Form EC8A, and Registration Area Collation Centre (RACC), with Form EC8B up to local government areas, and using Form EC8C to collate results, which are computed manually before announcement.\n\nOkoye maintained that INEC had perfected the use of technology to conduct elections starting from the 2023 general election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFor us to alter the methodology, the Electoral Act must be changed to accommodate the new innovations. We want National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act to enable INEC deliver a more transparent, fair and credible elections that will meet the aspirations of Nigerians. They should also look at 51, 52, 53 and 57 of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWe are already uploading election results electronically but we will need the relevant sections of the Electoral Act to be amended to avoid litigations, because INEC doesn\u2019t want our election winners to be determined by the law courts.\u201d\n\nOkoye said the commission was not answerable to NCC or any other federal government organ in carrying out its constitutional duties, saying INEC has inherent powers to conduct elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cNobody can bully INEC to share its powers given by the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria of Nigeria. Section 160 of Nigerian constitution mandates INEC to give NCC duties to perform, not NCC giving INEC orders.\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 52 of Electoral Act gives INEC inherent powers to conduct elections in any manner it wants, including e-voting. Again, the 2015 Electoral Act (as amended), which was signed by the former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has given INEC unfettered powers to conduct elections in the best method available.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the present method of manual collation of election results from PU, RACC and LGA should be done away with, adding, \u201cWith the introduction of Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) and other devices by INEC, elections in Nigeria can only get better, hence, National Assembly should join in deepening Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Saraki said in a statement by the head of his media office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, that the harmonisation of the versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill and its eventual passage should be concluded in time so that the law could be assented to before the political process leading to the 2023 general election. He said the success of the next round of elections would depend on the existence of a new enabling law with relevant provisions that would guarantee a credible, free, fair and peaceful process.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThat is why it is important that members of the Conference Committee should strive hard to rise above partisan and personal considerations. They should take decisions solely based on national interest and the need to strengthen our electoral process. The country is bigger than our various political parties. Nigeria is even bigger than any individual or any loyalty we may have to an individual.\n\n\u201cThat is why members of the committee should give genuine and deep consideration to the delicate issue of adopting the provision on electronic transmission of results, which will help to strengthen our electoral process, deepen our democracy and improve the level of participation in the elections.\n\n\u201cYour assignment is very crucial to the future of our country and if through your work we get a good law that will help in reforming the political process, you will be completing a great circle in the building of a legacy. It is a circle that started, when the immediate past National Assembly passed the same bill and only failed to get presidential assent, because of the politics of the period.\n\n\u201cI want to remind members of the respective hallowed and honourable chambers that at this point in our national history, we cannot fail to seize the opportunity that this bill presents to us to enthrone a credible and transparent electoral process. Whatever you do as you consider this bill is your own role in making history, in saving our democracy and building a future that is stable and progressive, where elected leaders truly represent the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that even after leaving the National Assembly, I have consistently canvassed the need for us to quickly pass a new Electoral Act that will include important provisions aimed at developing our electoral system. On one occasion in September 2020, during a webinar conference on \u2018Electoral Reforms and Democracy\u2019 organised by Centre for Advancement of Civil Liberties, I called on Nigerians to continue to create awareness on the importance of the Bill ahead of the 2023 elections\n\n\u201cAt this point, I need to appreciate the efforts of young people across the country, who went round spending their time and resources to create events aimed at generating awareness on the Bill, all members of the National Assembly, who have made sacrifices to get us this far, various development partners, civil society groups, members of the press and other stakeholders who played different roles in getting the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill to the semi-final stage, where it is almost getting to the point of becoming an effective Act of Parliament. We must continue to improve our system until we achieve the real objective of \u2018One Man, One Vote\u2019 and where the votes of the electorate count.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room said the version of the Electoral Act Amendment bill stipulating the recommendation of NCC before transmission of results electronically was a breach of the constitution. Convener of the group, Ene Obi, said at a news conference on Monday in Abuja that this would not augur well for democracy in the country. Obi insisted that the power to determine the procedure for transmission of results should be vested with INEC.\n\nThe Situation Room and its European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), its implementing partners, called on the National Assembly to show selflessness during the harmonisation.\n\nIt stated, \u201cNotwithstanding the landmark proposals in the on-going review process, civil society partners and key stakeholders have identified about 17 points of divergence in the versions of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed by the National Assembly. These are the use of smart card readers, deployment of electronic voting, collation and transmission of results, cost of campaigns, process of nomination of candidates, among others.\n\n\u201cAs expressed by a vast majority of electoral stakeholders and Nigerians, we are concerned by these identified differences in the proposals, particularly, regarding electronic transmission of results and deployment of technological devices.\n\n\u201cFollowing from our experience and observations of elections in recent years, as well as widely held views by Nigerians, we expect the harmonisation committee to accept the version of the bill that allows INEC to determine the mode of conduct of elections, including transmission of results.\u201d\n\nObi said INEC had shown that it had adequate capacity to use technology in elections, including the transmission of results.\n\nEne added that INEC\u2019s capability had been proven during the off-circle elections and through its use of the Z-pad and more recently, the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nAnother member of the Situation Room, Cynthia Mbamalu, said the group recommended the adoption of the senate version of clause 43, which recognised that INEC could use voting devices alongside election materials.\n\nIn addition, Mbamalu said, the group urged the harmonisation committee to adopt the Senate\u2019s version of clause 49, which recognised the use of other technological devices alongside smart card readers for voter accreditation. She added that the House of Representatives version of clause 52 should be adopted, as it gave INEC the power to determine the procedure for voting and transmission of election results.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "The British Army is ready to help ease fuel supply problems after a fourth day of long queues and pump closures.\n\nUp to 150 military tanker drivers will prepare to deliver to forecourts which have run dry because of panic buying.\n\nThe surge in demand came amid fears a driver shortage would hit fuel supply \u2013 which is plentiful at refineries.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \u201cWe are starting to see panic buying moderate with more grades of fuel available at more petrol stations.\u201d\n\nThe UK is estimated to be short of more than 100,000 lorry drivers \u2013 causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months.\n\nThe government has blamed people needlessly buying fuel for causing queues at many petrol stations with fuel running out in some places.\n\nMotoring group the RAC said the price of a litre of unleaded petrol had risen by a penny since Friday to an eight-year high. It added it was aware a small number of retailers were hiking prices amid the soaring demand.\n\nMeanwhile, there are mounting calls for key workers, such as health and social care staff, to receive priority access to fuel where it is available.\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the move to place the Army on standby \u2013 meaning it is ready to respond to any request for support \u2013 was a \u201csensible, precautionary step\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf required, the deployment of military personnel will provide the supply chain with additional capacity as a temporary measure to help ease pressures caused by spikes in localised demand for fuel,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s deputy political editor Vicki Young said she had been told an initial 75 military drivers would be on standby, with up to 150 and the same number of support staff available if needed.\n\nThey require specialised training which takes up to five days, she said.\n\nThe government has also authorised an extension to special driver licences that allow drivers to transport goods such as fuel.\n\nADR licences due to expire between 27 September and 31 December will have their validity extended until 31 January 2022, without refresher training or exams.\n\nLabour said the latest response to the fuel crisis was \u201can admission of failure\u201d and that asking the Army to step up was \u201ca sticking plaster\u201d.\n\nLeading fuel suppliers, including BP and Shell, have sought to reassure the public that supplies remain unaffected at source \u2013 with pressures expected to ease shortly.\n\n\u201cAs many cars are now holding more fuel than usual, we expect that demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, easing pressures on fuel station forecourts,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nDoctors, nurses, prison staff unions and care staff have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel.\n\nThe UK Homecare Association said people had been left waiting for carers at home because staff had been caught in queues for petrol.\n\nUnison called on ministers to use emergency powers to \u201cdesignate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers\u201d.\n\nSome ambulance trusts have their own fuel pumps in their depots and their supplies are expected to be prioritised \u2013 but essential workers can still be caught out.\n\nOne ambulance driver in north London told the BBC he had visited several filling stations in his search for fuel.\n\n\u201cI had zero tank, I was on my reserve, the light was on, it was getting chaotic, my heart rate was going through the sky,\u201d he said, after finally buying fuel in Brent Cross.\n\nJohn McSorley, Strategic Commander for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said the service had \u201csufficient fuel stocks\u201d for its ambulances and \u201crobust business continuity plans in place\u201d to ensure it could still attend to patients.\n\nHe added that some ambulance staff had found it \u201cdifficult\u201d to get fuel for their own cars, and that the trust had a staff transport plan it could activate \u201cshould the situation escalate further\u201d.\n\nCarol Curry, who needed fuel to drive her husband to a hospital appointment, said she blamed the media for frenzied scenes at the pumps.\n\n\u201cIf nobody had said about this, the lorry drivers and everything, then this panic wouldn\u2019t have started,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government has temporarily exempted fuel companies from competition law, allowing them to work together to target supplies at areas most in need.\n\nTemporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, for 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers have also been announced.\n\nBut Richard Walker, the managing director of supermarket Iceland, told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight the visas would not begin until mid-October, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know who would give up a full-time job in Europe for a matter of weeks.\u201d\n\nNearly one million drivers qualified to drive heavy goods vehicles are being encouraged to rejoin the sector, and some 3,000 new recruits are expected to undertake short, intensive driving courses.\n\nFactors including Brexit, the pandemic, pay levels and an aging workforce have all contributed to a shortage of lorry drivers.\n\nAfter the UK left the European Union, many European drivers went back to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere because of the additional border bureaucracy and the impact it had on their income.\n\nThe pandemic also prompted many foreign drivers to return home and led to a huge backlog in HGV driver exams. Driver shortages have also been seen in EU countries, including Germany and Poland.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "North Korea Fires Missile, Defends Weapons Tests at UN",
          "text": "North Korea has fired a suspected ballistic missile into the sea, officials in South Korea and Japan said, shortly before Pyongyang\u2019s representative told the United Nations the country had the \u201crighteous right\u201d to test weapons because of the \u201chostile\u201d policies directed against it.\n\nIn an emergency National Security Council meeting, the South Korean government expressed regret over what it called \u201ca short-range missile launch at a time when political stability on the Korean Peninsula is very critical\u201d.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s military earlier said a projectile fired from North Korea\u2019s mountainous northern Jagang province at about 6:40am local time (21:40 GMT) flew towards the North\u2019s eastern sea.\n\nDetails of the launch were being analysed by South Korean and US authorities. But Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said North Korea fired \u201cwhat could be a ballistic missile\u201d and that his government had stepped up its vigilance and surveillance.\n\nIt is the third launch this month after Pyongyang previously tested a \u201cstrategic\u201d cruise missile and two railway-borne ballistic missiles. The North is banned from conducting ballistic missile tests under United Nations sanctions imposed over the nuclear-armed country\u2019s weapons programme.\n\nThe US State Department condemned the launch and urged Pyongyang to engage in dialogue.\n\n\u201cThis launch is in violation of multiple UN Security Council Resolutions and poses a threat to the DPRK\u2019s neighbors and the international community,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK and call on them to engage in dialogue.\u201d\n\nThe launch took place less than hour before North Korea\u2019s UN envoy, Kim Song, addressed the organisation\u2019s annual meeting in New York.\n\nKim told the UN that Pyongyang had a \u201crighteous right to self-defence\u201d to develop weapons.\n\n\u201cWe are just building up our national defence in order to defend ourselves and reliably safeguard the security and peace of the country,\u201d he said, noting the US had nearly 30,000 troops stationed in the South and that there had been no formal treaty to end the Korean War.\n\nThe North invaded the South in 1950 and fighting came to an end three years later with an armistice, leaving the two countries technically still in a state of conflict.\n\nIf the US gave up its hostility, North Korea would \u201crespond willingly at any time\u201d, Kim told UN delegates in his speech.\n\n\u201cBut it is our judgement that there is no prospect at the present stage for the US to really withdraw its hostile policy.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden initiated a review of the country\u2019s North Korea policies after taking office in January. Washington has said while it is ready to hold talks with Pyongyang anywhere at any time there will be no \u201cgrand bargain\u201d.\n\nIn recent days, Pyongyang has given the impression it might be ready to resume engagement with Seoul, after South Korean President Moon Jae-in used his address to the UN last week to reiterate his longstanding calls for a formal declaration of an end to the Korean War.\n\nOn Saturday, Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and a key adviser, said Pyongyang was willing to consider an inter-Korean summit on the basis of mutual \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cimpartiality\u201d. A day earlier she had said the North was open to resuming talks with South Korea if it dropped its \u201chostile\u201d stance.\n\nThe South has also been enhancing its military arsenal.\n\nOn the same day that Pyongyang tested its railway-launched weapon, South Korea tested its first underwater-launched missile (SLBM), On Tuesday, the Navy planned to launch its third submarine capable of firing ballistic missiles, Yonhap said. The 3,000-tonne vessel will be able to carry 50 crew and remain underwater for 20 days.",
