          "text": ".\n\n**As Naval Chief warns Commanders to be ready for consequences of conniving with criminal elements & Fraudulent practices.\n\nBy: Kingsley Ononobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nFollowing the significant decline in piracy attacks in Nigerian waters put at 77 per cent occasioned by the Nigerian Navy\u2019s increased counter security operations against Maritime criminality, oil theft and other attacks, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has exited Nigeria from its Piracy List.\n\nThis feat was made known on Tuesday night by the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo at the closing ceremony of the 2022 CNS Retreat with PSOs, FOCs and Commanders of Formations in Abuja.\n\nWhile vowing to \u201csustain the tempo of our Maritime Security Operations efforts\u201d, the CNS said, \u201csame will be extended to our neighbouring states to rid the entire Gulf of Guinea of acts of piracy and other criminal activities.\n\nThis is just as the Naval Chief warned Commanders, \u201cthat severe sanctions would be imposed for any act of indiscipline, fraud or connivance with criminal elements in the performance of your duties\u201d adding. \u201cYou should be ready to solely bear the brunt of any misconduct from you or your men.\n\nVice Admiral Gambo said, \u201cAs you are all aware, the NN is the cardinal institution in the maritime sector that has the responsibility to lead the national response and prosecution of maritime threats. I make bold to say that the NN made giant strides in ensuring the security of the nation\u2019s maritime environment.\n\n\u201cIt is heartwarming to note the significant decline in piracy attacks by 77 per cent on Nigerian waters as reflected in the International Maritime Bureau (IBM) Third Quarter 2021 report.\n\n\u201cI am glad to notify you that the latest IMB report (just last week) shows that Nigeria has exited the IMB Piracy List. However, considering the NN\u2019s lead role in the regional effort at combating piracy and armed attack against shipping, the Service will not relent.\n\n\u201cAlso, the NN\u2019s effort at containing piracy in the nation\u2019s maritime domain has earned us commendation by the Office of the National Security Adviser on behalf of the President Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nTo the newly appointed Principal Staff Officers, FOCs and Formation Commanders, the CNS said, \u201cNotwithstanding the immediate gains of the past year, more is needed to be done to curb festering maritime crimes in the areas of crude oil theft, piracy, illegal migration and poaching.\n\n\u201cMore so, as the nation\u2019s maritime resources are germane to national prosperity, NN\u2019s operational efficiency remains pivotal to national development.\n\n\u201cAs newly appointed commanders, there is an intense sense of expectation that this Retreat has given to you to re-align your ideas and conduct to the imperatives of the maritime threats.\n\n\u201cBear in mind that your appointment is an opportunity for you to contribute your quota to national security. You must therefore be focused and be ready at all times to squarely deal with issues of maritime threat in your areas of operation.\n\n\u201cYou have to be committed and work towards attaining outstanding deliverables of the CNS SD 2021-5. This necessity is informed by the combination of our operational expectations and emergent threat scenario within the nation\u2019s maritime area of interest in a dwindling economy.\n\n\u201cIn order to succeed in your new offices, I enjoin you to acquaint yourselves with the CNS Strategic Directives and other relevant NN statutes guiding your various responsibilities.\n\nConsequently, he said, \u201cLet me warn you that severe sanctions would be imposed for any act of indiscipline, fraud or connivance with criminal elements in the performance of your duties. You should be ready to solely bear the brunt of any misconduct from you or your men.\n\n\u201cYou will be assessed periodically, assigned key performance indicators and would be expected to judiciously and legitimately deploy resources allocated to you.\n\nCongratulating the senior officers on their new appointment as commanders, commandants and commanding officers, he said, \u201cAlways be reminded that your appointment is in recognition of your potentials, hence, you must strive harder to uphold the image of the NN in all your endeavours.\n\n\u201cI must commend the organisers and also the participants at this Retreat for their efforts in putting up very robust interactive engagements. Your efforts have obviously yielded the desired results as the major objectives of the Retreat have been achieved.\n\n\u201cHowever, I must hasten to add that the achievements from this engagement are only a concept. Your job is not done until you have successfully applied the proffered strategies to optimize NN operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I expect all Principal Staff Officers, Flag Officers Commanding and commanders of formations to take advantage of the useful suggestions made in this forum, towards repositioning the NN under your command.\n\n\u201cOn my part, I assure you that the Naval Headquarters will give the required support in a bid to achieve the desired end state for the Service.\u201d\n\nPresenting the Communique at the end of the Retreat, the Chief of Policy and Pans, Rear Admiral Saidu Sanusi said, \u201cThe following resolutions were reached at the end of the CNS Retreat 2022:\n\nNHQ was to: (1) Explore new and emerging technologies including satellite technology for a survey of Nigeria\u2019s maritime domain and internal waters. (2) Review NN Training Policy.\n\n\u201c(3) Review the NNOs establishing the NAVTRAC and Directorate of Education to reflect the need to merge naval personnel training and education as inseparable human resource functions.\n\n(4) Develop a standard list of specific tasks to be executed by COs of ships under the first line maintenance schedule.\n\n\u201c(5) Explore the possibility of securing direct funding for NAVDOC from the FGN. (6) Facilitate access to endowment funds and international donor agencies financing for R&D activities of NAVDOC. (7) Set up a committee to consider areas that require the promulgation of doctrine in the NN.\n\n\u201c(8) Provide ship handling simulators for NAVDOC. (9) Ensure that PMLSC vessels are equipped with communication sets that are compatible with NN communication sets.\n\n\u201c(10) Expand NHL hospitality facilities and services to Kaduna, Calabar, Benin, Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja. (11) Institute training of officers on Leadership in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) environment.\n\n\u201c(12) Rejig KPIs for measuring deliverables to accommodate achievements that could not be easily measured with numerical values.\n\n(13) Reintroduce PWO course in NNS QUORRA training curriculum.\n\n\u201c(14) Set up desk offices at LOC and NHQ to oversee and ensure consummation of all existing contracts with OEMs. (15) Expedite the establishment of a Centre for Maritime Research and Security Studies at the NWCN.\n\n\u201cPSOs and AAs were to:\n\n(1) Intensify mentorship for young officers and ratings. (2) Institute workable feedback and quality control mechanism across every stratum of NN leadership.\n\n(3) Reinvigorate personnel evaluation reporting system.\n\n\u201cCPPLANS was to set up and chair an implementation team for the NHA, to among other things: (1) Develop a robust organisational structure and manning plan for the NHA with adequate representation from critical stakeholders across hydrography and other complementary fields in Nigeria.\n\n\u201c(2) Liaise with relevant committees of both chambers of the National Assembly towards facilitating the hitch free take-off of the NHA.\n\n\u201cCTOPS was to: (1) Facilitate NN representation in the National Diving Governing Council. (2) Reactivate the 9-channel line for fixed communication at NHQ and ensure the provision of an efficient official telephone system for staff and command officeholders.\n\n\u201cGMD NHL was to facilitate the floating of a PMLSC to be operated by AMSL.\n\n\u201cAAs (Administrative Authorities) were to (1) Sustain the concept of \u201cTrinity of Command\u201d using the instruments of Captain\u2019s Tables, Rounds and Divisions in the administration of personnel.\n\n\u201c(2) Facilitate execution of quick impact projects in their AORs. (3) Emplace measures to ensure prudent utilisation of assigned resources in the discharge of their duties as the NN would have zero tolerance for wastages.",

While we do this, we need to remind ourselves that a chain is as strong as its weakest link, which underlines the need to support the weak among us.\n\n\u201cWe need to always assist those who are weak emotionally or materially so that we can win together\u201d\n\nThe wife of Ondo governor stressed further that \u201cOn a day like this, apart from celebrating female champions in the various aspects of life, it is also appropriate to celebrate ourselves as heroes for standing tall despite the cultural and socioeconomic difficulties that we face on daily basis in this part of the world.\n\n\u201cThat we carry on with unbroken spirit despite the many challenges is a loud testimony to the fact that women are a special breed.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the challenges we face are many and tough and it appears that we have developed a thick skin for our troubles in many respects.\n\nHowever, instead of continuing to suffer these social, cultural and economic troubles in silence or giving up on the possibility of winning in the long run, we must begin the process of breaking free from these man-made challenges that are deliberately designed to stop women from reaching comparable heights.\n\n\u201cThis process of freeing women from these limitations must begin with us as individuals.

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK), in partnership with the United Bank for Africa (UBA) and 10 other global organizations, have launched a \u00a320 million (10.88 billion) to aid girls education and employment in developing countries.\n\nThe unveiling of the fund was part of the activities to mark the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe British High Commission, in a statement made available to Daily Sun, said Nigeria and Bangladesh are the first countries to benefit from the fund.\n\n\u201cTo mark International Women\u2019s Day today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has launched a new global partnership with 11 businesses to improve girls\u2019 access to education and employment.\n\n\u201d Countries like Nigeria and Bangladesh, two countries where significant barriers to girls\u2019 education remain, will be one of the first to benefit from the fund.\n\n\u201cThe UK Government is contributing an initial \u00a39m (4.89 billion Naira) , with businesses providing \u00a311m (5.98 billion Naira) in total.\n\n\u201d The programme aims to provide high quality skills training to around 1 million girls around the world.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cImproving girls\u2019 access to education is a key part of the UK\u2019s foreign policy, to ensure we build back better from the pandemic and prevent a lost generation.\n\n\u201d Investing in education helps lift communities out of poverty and protects girls from early marriage, forced labour and gender-based violence,\u201d the British High Commission said.\n\nThe British High Commission further said\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson launched the new \u00a320 million business partnership as the UK continues to lead global efforts to improve girls\u2019 access to education in developing countries.\n\nThe British High Commission added that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of children did not have any access to school and girls from disadvantaged families were particularly vulnerable to missing out on education, whether through poverty or prejudice.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic\n\nhas created even more barriers to education, with a peak of 1.6 billion children around the world having faced school closures.\n\n\u201d In the UK\u2019s first education partnership of its kind, the UK Government is joining forces with the private sector to boost girls\u2019 access to education in developing countries. Partners include Accenture, BP, Cognizant, Coursera,\n\nMicrosoft, Pearson, PwC, Standard Chartered, Unilever, United Bank for Africa and Vodafone.\n\n\u201cThe UK Government will be working in partnership with UNICEF\u2019s Generation Unlimited (GenU) to help deliver the programme, with key partners funding GenU being Accenture, Microsoft, Standard Chartered, Unilever, and United Bank of\n\nAfrica. On 7 March, a reception was held at No10 Downing Street to mark the announcement ahead of the 8 March 2022 International Women\u2019s Day. The event was attended by partners including: Jill Huntley, Global Managing Director, Corporate Citizenship at Accenture;\n\nDr Betty Vandenbosch, Chief Content Officer at Coursera and Marissa Thomas, Chief Operating Officer at PwC,\u201d the British High Commission also said.\n\nFollowing the launch, Johnson said:\n\n\u201cThe United Kingdom has long been a proud and mighty champion of this fundamental cause and today we take one leap further through our first Global Partnership of its kind \u2013 opening the opportunity for one million girls across\n\nthe developing world to have access to high quality skills training.\n\n\u201cEnsuring every girl and young woman across the globe receives 12 years of quality education is the greatest tool in our armoury to end the world\u2019s great injustices.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cDelivering on this mission will be one of the best defences against ignorance, ensure the greatest protection from prejudice and put a rocket booster behind our hopes and dreams for global development in the years to come.\u201d\n\nThe British High Commission added that businesses, charities, schools and colleges will shortly be able to bid for funds from the programme.\n\n\u201cThe partnership wants to support projects that will improve access to education for girls, with a focus on providing the Science, Technology, Engineering and\n\nMathematics (STEM) skills needed to find work in key sectors such as technology and manufacturing. This could include funding new skills training programmes, improving teaching or redesigning training to make it more relevant to business needs. Initially bids\n\nwill be encouraged for projects in Nigeria and Bangladesh, two countries where significant barriers to girls\u2019 education remain.\n\n\u201cFunding from the programme will also help expand GenU\u2019s `Passport to Earning\u2019 (P2E) platform. This digital skills platform will provide girls with free, certified education and skills training which they can then use to support future\n\nemployment and entrepreneurship opportunities. UNICEF\u2019s precursor to P2E was listed among\n\nTime\n\nMagazine\u2019s 100 Best Inventions of 2021.\n\n\u201cSome of the businesses involved will be contributing a range of resources including books, computers and other technology, mentors, advice and access to their networks, skills and training programmes. The private sector involvement\n\nwill help ensure that education and learning opportunities provide girls with the skills for the future that employers need.\n\n\u201cThe UK is playing a leading global role to improve girls\u2019 education in developing countries. During the UK\u2019s G7 Presidency last year it secured agreement to help get an additional 40 million girls into school by 2026; and secondly to help 20 million girls to learn to read by the age of 10 by 2026. In 2021, the UK hosted a successful Global Education Summit, which raised $4 billion in pledges from world leaders to support schools through the Global Partnership for Education. Between\n\n2015 and 2020, the UK supported at least 15.6 million children in developing countries to gain a decent education, including 8.1 million girls.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen considerable success with similar skills programmes such as the Alternative Learning Program (ALP) in Bangladesh. This involved training up marginalised young girls with the skills they needed to be able to secure jobs within demand sectors, which gave these young girls more economic, social and personal freedom. As a result, the programme saw a 62% reduction in child marriage among the girls and families involved.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the \u2018Educate!\u2019 programme across Uganda and Rwanda has provided industry-specific (agriculture and tourism) sessions for girls, as well as sessions to boost their literacy skills. This programme saw a 120% increase in income among the female participants,\u201d the British High Commission also said.\n\nUnited Kingdom Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, also said: \u201cSupporting women and girls is at the heart of UK foreign policy. We want women to have agency over their own lives and to be free to succeed.\n\n\u201cInvesting in girls\u2019 education is vital for a more sustainable, peaceful and prosperous future. That\u2019s why we are partnering with the private sector to help girls in developing countries access education and job opportunities.\u201d\n\nHelen Grant, the Prime Minister\u2019s Special Envoy for Girls\u2019 Education said: \u201cEvery girl everywhere deserves to have an education.\n\n\u201cFrom school right the way through to the workplace, our partnership will help give women and girls the skills they need to reach their full potential.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kevin Frey, Chief Executive Officer of Generation Unlimited said:\n\n\u201cThe Girls\u2019 Education Skills Partnership exemplifies the commitment of the UK government and the private sector in addressing the critical gap in skilling girls for 21st Century opportunities.\n\n\u201cP2E is an innovative skills platform designed with partners to reach the girls everywhere, every time, preparing them with in-demand market relevant skills.\u201d",

Yusuf Yusuf, around 12 noon, further heightened the tension and anxiety.\n\nHailed by crowd of party supporters and staff, Governor Bello, earlier reported to have taken over the running of the party from the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, presided over an emergency meeting held by the committee.\n\nShortly after the meeting by the Caretaker Committee and inauguration of the state chairmen, seven governors, comprising Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Hope Uzodimma (Imo), Abdulraman Abdulrazak (Kwara), Babagana Zulum (Borno), Inuwa Yahaya (Gombe) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun) had visited the secretariat in what Governor Bello described as show of solidarity.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after the meeting, Governor Bello, said though he had the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari to take charge of the party, he cannot confirm whether the Yobe governor had been shoved aside completely.\n\nAnnouncing that the presence of the state chairmen that came for inauguration was responsible for the rowdy situation at the secretariat, Governor Bello claimed that he was just acting on Buni\u2019s behalf.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

And they are to maintain law and order.\u201d\n\nAsked how often he would be in charge, he said: \u201cAlmost everyday,\u201d adding: \u201cmost of my colleague governors are here to support me to receive the report from the zoning committee. You know the zoning committee report is a very important one. And all the governors here are here to support me. Now, at zonal level, they can go and do their work. What is going on today, does it have the blessing of the president? \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nAsked in what capacity he presided over the meeting and whether he had been confirmed as chairman, he said: \u201cI have been acting for a while since the chairman traveled. As for your question for me to confirm the news that I have been appointed to take over from Buni as the acting Chairman, I can only say that it is news and I don\u2019t have comment.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

They can\u2019t disprove that. But, that was where the problem arose.\n\n\u201cThe governors were angry when they heard that the CECPC secretary had been in charge in Buni\u2019s absence. They asked why he transferred power to the secretary when, in fact, he, Buni, could have handed over to one of the governors. That was the crux of the matter, as at last weekend\u2026\u201d the source disclosed.\n\nMeanwhile, the national leadership of the party had earlier dismissed the report of change in the leadership of the party, describing it as fake news.\n\nThe statement signed by the Secretary APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, urged members and supporters of the party to remain calm.\n\n\u201cThe APC is a progressive political party guided by rules.

          "title": "NCDMB: Afreximbank Invested over $42bn in African Enterprises in Five Years",
          "text": "\u2022Africa must address funding, technology, other limitations to achieve energy security, says Sylva\n\nPeter Uzoho\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) yesterday disclosed that the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) had invested more than $42 billion in support of African businesses between 2016 and 2020.\n\nPresident of Afreximbank, Professor Benedict Oramah, stated that the continental multilateral institution was presently the largest lender to the multi-million dollar 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery currently under construction at the Lekki Free Trade Zone, Lagos.\n\nThey spoke at a forum with the theme, \u201cEvolving a Pan-African Strategy Towards Sustainable Funding of Africa Oil and Gas Projects,\u201d targeted at oil and gas practitioners especially member nations of the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO).\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the maiden edition of the African Local Content Investment Forum (ALCIF) in Lagos, Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Mr. Simbi Wabote, described Afreximbank as one bright spot in the continent mandated to finance and promote intra and extra-African trade.\n\nWabote recalled that Afreximbank signed a $1.04 billion facility with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to finance the exploration of petroleum during the second intra-Africa trade fair which held in Durban, South Africa, few days after the completion of Climate Change Conference (COP-26) in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn respect of African institutions, one bright spot is the African Export-Import Bank (Afrexim Bank), a pan-African multilateral financial institution mandated to finance and promote intra-and extra-African trade based in Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\u201cIt is very instructive that Afreximbank signed a $1.04 billion facility with the NNPC Limited to finance the exploration of petroleum during the second intra-Africa trade fair which held in Durban, South Africa, few days after the completion of COP-26 event in Glasgow.\n\n\u201cFor a bank that disbursed more than $42 billion between 2016 and 2020 in support of African enterprises, there is no doubt that Afreximbank is an institution of note in consideration of the quest for funding hydrocarbon development projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe executive secretary said African Development Bank (AfDB) made similar financial support to African businesses in line with the bank\u2019s objective to spur sustainable economic development and social progress in member countries thus contributing to poverty reduction.\n\nAccording to Wabote, AfDB has the African Development Fund (ADF), which became operational in 1974 and has cumulatively invested $45 billion over its 44 years of operation on the African continent.\n\nNoting that the fund had not been used much in the hydrocarbon sector, he said there was opportunity to engage AfDB to utilise part of the fund for gas development, which could be of interest to its largely Western donor countries against the backdrop of disruption in gas supplies in Europe.\n\nAt country level, according to Wabote, Nigeria represents a bright spot in the provision of funds that can be sourced for the execution of oil and gas projects. He explained that the funds included the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCIF) and other funds that could be sourced from Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), like the Bank of Industry (BOI), Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM Bank) ,and other special funds managed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nHe cited the NCDMB partnered with BOI to establish the $300 million NCI Fund and the NCDMB partnership with NEXIM bank to create a$50-million fund for Working Capital and for Women in Energy.\n\nIn the area of research and development, Wabote said the NCDMB had sponsored the patent for some inventions, and had commenced the process of commercialising those inventions.\n\nHe also said a $50-million Research and Development (R&D) Fund was also launched to enable research and development in the oil and gas industry.\n\nBeyond the provision of intervention funds as loans to industry players, he maintained that the board had also entered into partnerships with project promoters in the hydrocarbon sector.\n\nIn the aspect of modular refineries, the executive secretary noted that NCDMB was serving as a catalyst in the development of four modular refineries with the 5,000bpd Waltersmith Modular Refinery already in operation.\n\nHe pointed out that the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), played a role in seeing the project to fruition, listing the other three modular refineries under construction as the 2,500bpd Duport Modular Refinery, 2,000bpd Atlantic Refinery and the 12,000bpd Azikel Modular Refinery.\n\nWabote explained that the essence of the event was for stakeholders to develop a robust response to the push for Africa to abandon her hydrocarbon resources.\n\nThe forum, he further explained, was to highlight some of the bright spots of the business, both at the national and continental levels to attract or deploy funding to the oil and gas industry, and propose some ideas to enhance continental collaboration and global support for fossil fuels.\n\nHe explained, \u201cAlready, some European banks are pulling out of hydrocarbons development projects and most International Operating Companies are shying away from investments in hydrocarbon projects to avoid backlash from green energy activists.\n\n\u201cThis unfolding scenario is of huge concern to African leaders and policy makers in the oil and gas industry. It is, therefore, critical that we explore the necessary steps required to address this funding and investment challenge so that our hydrocarbon resources are not abandoned below the surface, like many African countries, including Nigeria, abandoned their coal mines.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of a comfort that some African countries have made some in-roads in securing funding and investment for the development of hydrocarbon projects with strategic partnerships with countries that have not turned themselves to oil and gas adversaries such as China and India.\n\n\u201cOther African countries are also doing their bit to develop infrastructure and processing plants for the hydrocarbon value chain but there is need to do more.\n\n\u201cOne of such bright spots is the 650,000bpd Dangote Refinery which is now mechanically complete. This investment represents a major testament of the emerging crop of bold and audacious African businessmen positioning themselves and the continent on the map of the required energy mix for mankind.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there was a genuine battle for the soul of the hydrocarbon industry in Africa, adding that Africans must all rally to save the industry or stand by while the continent perishes right in front of our eyes.\n\nIn his remarks, Oramah, who was represented at the forum by the bank\u2019s Director/Global Head, Advisory and Capital Markets, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna, said Afreximbank had invested a total of $4 billion as of the third quarter (Q1) 2020 to support businesses in Nigeria.\n\nHe said by Q3 2021, the number of funds invested in the country passed $5 billion, adding that in the last four months, the bank has supported the NNPC Limited with $1 billion.\n\nOramah stated, \u201cBy the third quarter of 2020, our total investment is about $4 billion. By the third quarter of last year, the number has passed $5 billion. Over the last four months, we\u2019ve given $1 billion for NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe signed $5 billion agreement with NNPC. We signed an MOU of $5 billion with UTM Offshore. Also, the BOI which was mentioned, we provided over \u20ac700 million bond for them last week.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to mobilise global financing to Africa, we have also lent some of the largest syndications in the sector. In fact, about the largest refinery in the world, which is the Dangote Refinery, we are today, the largest lender to that facility.\u201d\n\nIn his keynote address, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, who was represented at the occasion by Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr. Nasir Gwarzo, said Africa must address funding, technology and other limitations in the oil and gas industry in order to attain energy security and in-continent value addition.\n\nSylva listed some of the limitations as, \u201cdearth of funds to finance its oil and gas sector projects; limitations in technology mastery to manage the oil and gas industry; high-end skills gap; inadequate energy infrastructure to sustain oil and gas industry operations; undeveloped internal market for hydrocarbon derivatives and overdependence on sale of crude oil for foreign exchange and budget financing.\u201d\n\nHe said Africa\u2019s energy transition should be anchored on maximising fossil fuels (gas) utilisation and investment in renewable energy projects.\n\nWith over 600 million people living without access to modern energy, the minister said Africa\u2019s energy demand in 2035 would be 40 per cent higher than it is today, compared to 10 per cent higher for global energy demand. The minister said this growth would be driven by industrialisation, population and expansion in economic activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

So sad, we are no longer safe.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the killing of the vigilantes, another source told SaharaReporters that the deceased persons were ambushed after being fed wrong information regarding the location of the bandits.\n\nThe source said, \u201cYesterday, after killing many people and rustling cows, the youths from Dabai, Magajiya, Ribah, Diri and Danrnagi villages confronted the bandits with their locally made guns.\n\n\u201cThey killed many of the Bandits; along the line, someone called them and gave them wrong information about the location of the bandits, so that was how they fell into the ambush of the bandits.\n\n\u201cThe location is Sakaba Local Government Area, Zuru Emirate, Kebbi state. It's a border town between Kebbi South and Niger. The town has produced many Generals.\n\n\u201cRight now, they are still operating in Zuru villages. The soldiers and the police are more afraid than the civilians.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the incident.\n\nThe President expressed sadness over what he described as \u201cthe brutal murder of tens of vigilantes\u201d. Buhari in a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, also expressed his condolences to the family members of the deceased.\n\n\u201cThis egregious level of criminality is shocking and I want to assure Nigerians that I will do all it takes to tackle this monster decisively,\u201d the President was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cMy greatest preoccupation is the threat to life posed by these murderous gangs and remorseless outlaws who have no slightest regard for the sanctity of life.\n\n\u201cWhile extending my sympathy to the families of the victims of this savagery, let me use this opportunity to also call on our security forces to be more proactive and redouble their efforts in order to frustrate the operational plans of the terrorists before they even launch attacks.\u201d\n\nNote: Check the photos if they can be blurred as they are very gory.

          "title": "Meet the startups driving a fintech revolution in DR Congo",
          "text": "As with most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, access to basic financial services is significantly limited in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just 14% of the population have an actual bank account and only 25% have an account with either banking or any other financial institution.\n\nMore so, there is less than 35 kilometre of paved road for every 1 million inhabitants in the French-speaking country, making traditional branch-based banking unfeasible for most of its 90 million residents and the bid for financial inclusion arduous.\n\nThe digital finance revolution that\u2019s played out in the rest of Africa over the past decade thus cannot come soon enough for people in the central African nation, especially given it has a 47% mobile phone penetration rate, with the figure likely to grow further.\n\nA number of startups have sprung up over the past 5 years, which, through fintech innovations, have brought financial services closer to where people live and work. One such is Flash International, the largest fintech and payments aggregator in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlash operates a network of agents that allows people to do their banking on its mobile platform (FlashApp), putting financial services\u2014including remittance, payments, and other value-added services\u2014within easy reach.\n\nThe startup currently has roughly 3,500 agents and 90 branches, through which it serves more than 2 million customers. And instead of opening individual accounts with multiple banks or mobile money operators, Flash gives its users a card with which they can accept all payments.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Johannesen, whose 25 years of professional experience cuts across roles in financial institutions like Citi and mobile finance firms Moneytrans and TigoCash, started the company in 2018.\n\nSince its launch, Flash has recorded stellar growth and is currently integrated with several banks, mobile money, and telecom operators. It claims to process nearly 1 million transactions valued at over $50 million per month through its payment services and also facilitates more than 40,000 satellite TV subscription transactions, one of its value-added products.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the mission was to build the first Congolese fintech that would aggregate as many financial and value-added services as possible. \u201cWhat we currently have is an application with up to 27 different products and services, through which thousands of agents make a living out of,\u201d Johannesen recalled in a recent interview with TechCabal.\n\nA screenshot of the Flash web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nUnlike Flash, Okapi Finance was launched out of Sweden by founder Gis\u00e8le Mwepu, with DRC being one of the company\u2019s four markets across all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The startup rolled out its services in the country last year and currently has 170,000 customers. Its goal, according to Mwepu, is to reach up to 25 million people in the country in less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cDRC has over 90 million people and still there aren\u2019t many financial services solutions available. The opportunity is very huge. And the unbanked people aren\u2019t just individuals, they can be traders, merchants, or informal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Okapi platform allows both individual and enterprise customers carry out daily financial transactions like deposits, money transfers, and salary disbursements through its web and mobile platforms, USSD, and physical agents.\n\nOkapi has a special focus on getting more women included in the country\u2019s financial services ecosystem. Per Mwepu, up to 80% of the company\u2019s DRC users and 95% of the 17,000 merchants it\u2019s onboarded are women. For the latter, the company extends a line of credit\u2014weekly loans of around $50\u2014to help power their businesses.\n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion cannot be achieved by only allowing people to carry out payment transactions,\u201d Mwepu noted. \u201cWe need to increase their accessibility to a wide array of financial services.\u201d\n\nThrough the Okapi platform, microfinance banks and insurance providers can distribute their products, enabling them penetrate the informal sector and reach the unbanked population. In addition, users don\u2019t need a bank account to access these services and after signing up can apply for the Okapi Visa card.\n\nA screenshot of the Okapi Finance web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nWhereas Flash focuses on urban areas like Kinshasa with most of its agents in DRC\u2019s major cities, Faysal Axam\u2019s startup targets the unbanked population in rural areas, where more than half of the population resides.\n\nIn Goma, the capital and business hub of North Kivu province in the eastern DRC, Faysal Company offers a \u201cTap and Pay\u201d solution\u2014a magnetic card that interacts with POS machines and interfaces with a virtual wallet.\n\n\u201cFinancial flows are mostly in DRC\u2019s urban areas, not so much in peri-urban areas, and nearly not at all in rural areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile mobile money penetration rate is 72% in cities, it\u2019s only 28% in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCircumventing fintech challenges in DRC\n\nIn a country like DRC where road and internet infrastructure is below par, agents are especially effective at reaching rural dwellers and reducing deployment costs for providers.\n\nFor customers, agent networks reduce travelling time and security risks as they historically had to locate one of the only 500 bank branches available in the country\u2014which is ironically Africa\u2019s second-largest country by land area and the fourth most populous.\n\n\u201cMost transactions are done over the counter in DRC as there\u2019s still a very low penetration in terms of smartphones and internet access is not affordable. Also, the prevalent habit of the population is mainly to visit an agent for a transaction or service,\u201d Johannesen said.\n\nA high capital barrier for entry in the financial services space preserves the dominance of big banks like Ecobank and UBA as well as network operators (such as Vodacom Congo, Orange RDC, and Bharti Airtel who collectively control 35-40 million subscribers).\n\nFintech startups looking to partner with banks and telcos have had to deal with skepticism and aversion from the industry giants. Axam recalled it took Faysal almost a year and a half to get its first mobile money integration license in 2020 after the startup was rebuffed by banks and local mobile network operators for partnerships.\n\nA screenshot of the Faysal Company web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nMultipay Congo, DRC\u2019s first inter-banking platform, was launched in 2015 to create interoperability between payment platforms like ATMs and point of sale machines.\n\nBut the framework doesn\u2019t make integrating with banks and telcos any easier for fintechs, according to Mwepu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to achieve financial inclusion without interoperability of solutions from other stakeholders like banks and telcos. We have to work together,\u201d the Okapi Finance founder said.\n\nOn the back of a successful partnership with Orange, Faysal\u2019s customer base has exceeded 10,000. Although that\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s significant nonetheless in a country where more than 70% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day and most have no immediate incentives to open financial accounts.\n\nAxam added that Faysal\u2019s growth is also because the solution can be used offline, even in areas without internet connectivity.\n\nWith internet access at around 17%, feature phones \u2013 which retail at about $20 \u2013 play a huge role in enabling Congolese to access digital finance services. Faysal, for instance, gets most of its traction from the USSD feature as Goma dwellers often must seek a mountaintop just to access 2G cell phone coverage.\n\nIn addition, while banks and telcos boast sufficient financial muscle to build and scale their products, startups lack access to sufficient finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t have finance, investors, incubators, and accelerators, especially in Goma,\u201d Axam said, citing security issues as a challenge that makes it hard for investors to trust the ecosystem. \u201cMany excellent solutions here can\u2019t get continental or international exposure because of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to note that the DRC\u2019s fintech landscape is practically nascent with only 12 startups playing in the space as of 2018, per a report from Microsave and MasterCard. But the digital finance seeds are clearly beginning to take root and there are concrete reasons to be bullish about the opportunities in DRC for fintech and its prospect to attract investors.\n\nWith startups like Flash, Okapi, Faysal, alongside remittance fintechs, partnerships like the Mastercard and Billetera deal targeting the millions of financially excluded residents, as well as the government\u2019s increasing shift towards virtual payments for its over thousands of civil servants, one can anticipate a radical digital finance expansion in the coming years as DRC moves to replicate other African countries\u2019 successes, slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cFintechs in DRC are beginning to thrive. It\u2019s definitely promising but a better infrastructural coverage is crucial to realising full potential,\u201d said Noel K. Tshiani founder of Congo Business Network, an international network of Congolese professionals and entrepreneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the vision of the DRC government under President Felix Tshisekedi and its ambitious digitisation program aligned with the country\u2019s National Digital Plan.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

But 8 years into their friendship, they have built and run a couple of projects and businesses together and, now, they are focused on building Pivo, a startup they envision will be the neobank for trade in Africa. Like AfreximBank but faster and digitally operated.\n\nThe big picture is to be the go-to neobank for trade in Africa by the end of this year, or next.\n\nPivo entered the market with Pivo Capital, a credit-focused financial services platform for supply chain small and medium businesses (SMEs), because of the co-founders\u2019 track record in the supply chain industry, especially the logistics aspect.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLong before Pivo, Amadi-Emina, a software engineer, worked as a tech consultant for Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for over 2 years.

She remained at Kobo360 for a little over 3 years before leaving last year to focus on Pivo.\n\nFor Akwiwu, a trained lawyer who claimed to have stumbled on tech by chance and the influence of friends like Amadi-Emina, her law career, which started officially in 2013, spanned across law firms and companies like Gilmor Engineering, one of the biggest engineering firms in Nigeria, where she worked for over 6 years.\n\nBut, along the line, she started playing with project and product management and operations, monitoring projects, and product development lifecycles on the side. Last year, she decided to transition fully into tech. She left law to focus on building Pivo and getting a master\u2019s degree in software development while at it.\n\nWith Amadi-Emina\u2019s experience in the logistics side of the supply chain, having worked and led the port operation effort at Kobo360, Akwiwu\u2019s experience in law, and their collective knowledge of running an exportation business, building a business that serves the logistics arm of the supply chain was a no-brainer.\n\nLogistics supply chain is Pivo\u2019s first stop\n\nIn Africa, access to credit is still one of the biggest challenges small businesses deal with, especially small supply chain businesses. Supply chain businesses usually have a short time to execute a contract, and due to the excessive bureaucracy and numerous requirements, acquiring credit from traditional financial institutions takes a long time, therefore these businesses are automatically at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is where Pivo comes in.\n\nA truck loading at the port. Image source: Lori\n\nLaunched in September last year, Pivo provides flexible and quick financing options for supply chain businesses like logistics service providers, clearing and forwarding businesses, and FMCG distributors. Pivo is like a third-party partner in a transaction between a buyer and a seller. But to understand what Pivo does, one must first understand how supply chain financing works.\n\nSupply chain finance is a type of cash advance suppliers receive from lenders to fulfill a transaction or contract before the buyer pays them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: a merchant wants to supply a buyer with goods but needs some working capital to see the transaction through before the buyer pays them. So the merchant approaches the lender (that would be Pivo, in this case) for a credit. The lender then collects all required information to check for the legitimacy of their transaction or contract claim with the buyer, then disburses the credit once the buyer confirms the contract.\n\nThe above illustration explains Pivo at its core. Once a business finishes their KYC and asks for credit, Pivo prompts them to supply all the information about the transaction they need financing for. After that, Pivo profiles the business seeking credit for worthiness, runs a risk assessment on the transaction, and then profiles the businesses they are doing the transaction with, to ascertain whether they are credible and good for the money.\n\nOnce everything checks out and the buyer agrees to pay into the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, Pivo then disburses the loan. In partnership with Providus Bank, Pivo provides its customers with a business account that facilitates remittance. So, after the money lands in the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, the startup takes its dues.\n\nAll these checks and assessments help Pivo to finance only creditworthy customers and less-risky transactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to ensure 98% recovery on every single capital we deploy to our customers,\u201d Amadi-Emina told TechCabal.\n\nAmadi-Emina also mentioned that the average capital requests they\u2019ve received per customer is about $10,000. And while they cater for credits within the range of $5,000 from the company\u2019s balance sheet, requests above $5,000 are passed to their credit partners.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nFor now, the startup is still building in a stealth mode and according to the CEO Amadi-Emina, Pivo currently has about 250 direct SMEs customers and 5 ecosystem leads, which are the larger corporations that Pivo serve the SMEs within their value chain through embedded finance. Each ecosystem lead is reported to have about 500 to 1,000 SMEs.\n\nThe startup lists some of the top logistic companies in Africa as its ecosystem lead customers including Jetstream Africa, SabiRoad, Vee Logistics, and MVx.\n\nOn the side of its loan book, the co-founders said they have disbursed $1 million worth of credit out of over $2 million worth of applications that they have received since launch.\n\nThe company makes money from the interest charged on the credit disbursed, management fees, and the one-off charges from account creation. Akwiwu believes that as they continue to add more offerings, they will have more sources of revenue.\n\nThe startup has also raised a 6-figure preseed from Microtraction, FirstCheck Africa, Ventures Platform, Mercy Corps Venture, Rally Cap Ventures, Metis Capital Partner, Bold Angel Fund, and recently just got into the ODX accelerator programme where it\u2019s entitled to $125,000 for a 7% equity stake.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFor Akwiwu and Amadi-Emma, the roadmap is clear and they already have new products that will help them become a full-fledged neobank for trade in the works. For example, products like Invoice Factoring and Pivo Plus, which includes insurance and corporate compliance offerings, are already in the testing phase.\n\nThe company is currently only operational in Nigeria with the plan to expand into Ghana before the end of the year.\n\nThe competition in the credit market in Africa is heating up and it\u2019s good for SMEs. While there are new upstarts springing up to provide credit for businesses, the bigger ones are also making a fray into the scene. For instance, Flutterwave, the unicorn fintech, has joined the credit space with the recent announcement of Flutterwave Capital.\n\nWhile other startups like Payhippo, Lendigo, Float, and even Brass have successfully built a digital financial institution that provides credit for African SMEs, Pivo is the only one playing strictly in the supply chain sector, at least that we know of at the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The total worth of disbursed credit has been changed from $980,000 to $1 million. Between the time we interviewed the founders and the date this article was published, Pivo disbursed another $20,000 in credit.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Togolese inventor builds $12,000 mini tractors for the West African market",
          "text": "First, he received awards for inventing the \u201cFoufoumix\u201d, which brings relief from hours spent pounding foufou. Then, Minsob Logou invented a mini-tractor, tailor-made for local conditions. Now, he wants to sell it across the region.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Blame Ekoue of bird story agency.\n\nSeeing imported agricultural machinery \u2013 often paid for by government or donors \u2013 lying discarded due to the unavailability of local servicing or parts was enough for Minsob Logou to invest his time, money, and energy into a local solution for farmers. The result: the Logoutrac mini-tractor. It\u2019s a step out of the kitchen and into the field for this award-winning Togolese inventor.\n\nBetter known in Togo and the region as the \u201cfather of Foufoumix\u201d Logou requires little introduction to those who keep an eye on the world of African invention. As early as 2002, Logou was honoured for his work by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in 2014, he placed second at the African Innovation Awards. His desire to invent is deep-seated.\n\n\u201cThe story started from a passion that I had from an early age for all things related to technology. Since the benches of the school, I had this thing in me for all that is technological. I have to try to see how they were designed, how we arrive at what we design can respond to a given functionality. This is what gave me all this knowledge today, which far exceeds what I learned on the benches,\u201d Logou explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBorn into a large family, his position as an engineer at Togo Telecom, though coveted, was not enough to stop the inventor from resigning to devote himself to finding solutions full time. His first big win came with an invention that allows cooks at home and in restaurants to replace hours of strenuous work \u2013 the Foufoumix. The industrial-looking kitchen unit has been a hit in West Africa to such an extent that knock-offs are now produced in China. Logou tries to provide local solutions to local problems.\n\n\u201cThe basis of my research to be able to create a product is the observation of my community. When I see that they are in need of something, I can create machinery to make it easier for them to obtain a result in order to improve performance and make their lives better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was the thinking behind his latest invention, launched recently at his small factory located on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9. Logou describes his mini-tractor \u2013 which sports the \u201cLogoutrac\u201d brand \u2013 as a \u2018made-in-Togo mini-tractor, a versatile, powerful, and resilient machine\u2019.\n\nThe prototype for the tractor, which retails for the local equivalent of $12,000, was built using salvaged parts, with the idea that doing so would help buyers easily access spare parts. But due to high initial demand, the young Togolese engineer quickly took the next step.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay in recovery or recycling anymore and I am now manufacturing some of the spare parts of this machinery myself,\u201d he explained.\n\nLogou said that the initial idea for the mini-tractor came from his frustration at seeing the vast amounts of money that are used to purchase foreign agricultural machinery, only for it to be abandoned because spare parts are too difficult to too expensive to purchase locally.\n\n\u201cThe solutions that we import from elsewhere, most of the time, fail to meet our needs. So we end up with problems in agricultural mechanisation. Big tractors don\u2019t last long in the field before they break down. And when they stall, first, the expertise to detect the breakdown is a problem and the same spare part must be ordered from the parent company, which is quite complicated,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe $12,000-mini tractors built by Minsob Logou. Image credit: bird story agency.\n\nSelling at 7 million FCFA (the equivalent of around $12,000), the mini-tractors are built for a regional market as well as a local one. That is why Lougou is looking carefully at the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Togo is a signatory \u2013 and which should help him sell his inventions across Africa. Currently, there are trade barriers in place which prevent significant exports.\n\n\u201cPeople are showing interest but so far, there has been no international export. We should do it but the problem is free trade between African countries,\u201d fumed Logou.\n\nCurrently, Logoutrac equipment is sold by agricultural groups and the Togolese Ministry of Agriculture. A lower-cost option is already in the works.\n\n\u201cSince the cost is not within the reach of all farmers, we are working on a tiller for those who cannot afford it,\u201d Lougou explained.\n\nLogou\u2019s other pet project is finding solutions to a far wider problem: counterfeiting. While counterfeiting is estimated at 10% worldwide, it reaches 30 to 80% of products sold in Africa, depending on the sector. He has good reason to want to bring an end to counterfeits, especially of his Foufoumix product.\n\n\u201cThere are Chinese choppers that our compatriots import to sell and announce that it is foufoumix, but the latter is a registered trademark which has a patent\u2026 Having had trials in this direction, the conclusion that I have drawn is that our justices in West Africa are not strong enough in the field of intellectual property. There is still a lot to be done,\u201d he says, adding that he has brought counterfeiters to justice but nothing has come out of it.\n\nTo deal with this problem, he prefers to focus instead on the quality of his products.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is to have quality products,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The event was graced by Mr Otunba Taiwo Omolekan, President, LSTDCOA; Honorable Mike Oladipupo, general secretary of LSTDCOA, and other high-ranking members of LSTDCOA.\n\nComrade Idris, President of Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private-owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Ayodele Kumolu, representative, Universal Insurance plc, and Mr Israel Ifedayo, Mizala tech partner, were also present at the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verify and Pay platform is a new face to transportation in Nigeria; currently, it has been launched for the Lagos Yellow Cabs but will also cut across other forms of transport within the state, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt before the end of the year.\n\nMr Otunba, the president of LSTDCOA, gave a breakdown of the journey so far for taxi drivers. He said that he has been working on providing solutions to the issues affecting taxi drivers and their services.\n\nHe added that technology has to be embraced to prevent the extinction of yellow taxi cabs in Lagos state.\n\nSpeaking at the event, CEO of Univasa, Dr Ben Adeniyi, said, \u201cThe verify and pay platform initiative was born out of the need to be an \u201cEnabler\u201d to service providers and consumers.\n\nFor us at Univasa, providing innovative services is at the helm of our operations, and we continue to hold it as a top priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a driver-partner with Univasa, you get to enjoy the convenience of receiving your payments instantly with our instant withdrawal feature, so \u201cCash or Card e no matter\u201d as we like to say and for the riders, we are offering you a chance to own your experience while hailing a ride\u201d.\n\nComrade Idris gave a brief speech, where he called for solidarity between members of LSTDCOA and PEDPA as they stand to benefit from each other.\n\nMr Ayodele Kumolu, the representative of Universal Insurance plc, also spoke in detail about their flexible insurance packages. Drivers can apply and make payments in instalments, either a weekly, monthly or yearly package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Univasa rolled out its Drive-to-Own empowerment program, which allows drivers on the Univasa ride-hailing app to pick a Univasa car as their vehicle of choice to work, make daily remittances for a duration of 18-24months, which will be deducted from their earnings from the app, and then the driver gains permanent ownership of the car.\n\nThe Univasa team also confirmed that the cars in the drive-to-own scheme had been insured with Universal Insurance plc and tech partners, Mizala. The insurance covers the car, third party and life.\n\nUnivasa also has a package for drivers who meet the earning mark of NGN 200,000 in a month. They will automatically be beneficiaries of free insurance against the next month, and others can also easily apply for comprehensive insurance on a flexible payment structure.\n\nThe yellow cab drivers expressed their excitement for the new initiatives by Univasa especially verify and pay platform, as it will help them track their rides and also help to improve the reputation of the association as their riders will be more assured of their safety.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa, Dr Ben Adeniyi said that the onboarding process won\u2019t be limited to the drivers alone as passengers need to understand how to use the platform. It will enable the passengers to easily adopt the platform and increase trust as they know the driver is affiliated with Univasa and LSTDCOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivasa is a wholly-owned Nigerian Company that provides a one-stop solution to fulfil the daily needs of Africans via cutting-edge digital technology. Univasa launched its ride-hailing application in the later part of 2020 in Lagos with a partnership with the popular Lagos yellow cabs (LSTDCOA) with a campaign called \u201cBaba dey Online\u201d and has since expanded operations to Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Benin City, Akure, Ilorin; Kwara state and Abuja.\n\nThe Univasa User and Provider User and Provider apps are available for download on Google Playstore and the Apple AppStore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine War has been described as the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War II. While the war lingers, cryptocurrencies have become a significant theme in the conflict as crypto donations pour in to support Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russian troops invaded neighbouring European country, Ukraine. While Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, described the invasion as a \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d The Washington Post reports that more than 2,870 Ukrainian troops have been killed and more than 3,500 wounded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCivilian and soldiers taking cover. Souce: Aljazeera.\n\nRussia and Ukraine are the two largest countries in Europe; however, their military capabilities are miles apart.\n\nRussia has one of the largest and most powerful militaries globally, and according to Aljazeera, it spent $61.7 billion on its military in 2020. For context, that is 32.4% \u2014 $46.6 billion (\u2248 \u20a619.15 trillion) \u2014 more than Nigeria\u2019s budget for 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, Ukraine spent $5.9 billion (\u20a62.4 trillion) on its military in the same year. Some countries have sent military equipment to Ukraine because of Russia\u2019s military superiority. It received shipments of weapons from the US as part of a $200m defensive package approved by President Joe Biden in December 2021.\n\nHowever, support has also been pouring in for the Eastern European country in cryptocurrencies. According to CNBC, the crypto donations that have come in one week are valued at $54 million. But what does this mean for the global crypto market, adoption, and regulation?\n\nUkraine requested crypto donations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Aljazeera\n\nUkraine\u2019s 31-year-old Deputy Prime Minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, made the call for crypto donations for Ukraine on Telegram and Twitter on Saturday, February 26, 2022.\n\nStand with the people of Ukraine\n\nNow accepting cryptocurrency donations.

After confirmation, Buterin deleted the tweet, and donations started pouring in. The Washington Post said 46,000 people donated amounts a little less than $100.\n\nThere were also large donations like the $290,000 from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, and $280,000 sent anonymously.\n\nInterestingly, donations also came in the form of very valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, there is no need to sell them as cryptocurrency donations keep pouring in. Crypto analytics firm, Elliptic, also confirmed a $5.8 million grant by Polkadot Founder, Gavin Wood.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian crypto exchange, Kuna.io, some donations have been turned to fiat, particularly Euro, and used to purchase military equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do crypto donations to Ukraine affect the crypto market, adoption, and regulation?\n\nWith crypto donations to Ukraine shining more light on already spotlighted cryptocurrencies, crypto evangelists have seized the opportunity to reiterate the benefits of cryptocurrencies and how people who oppose digital currencies have misunderstood them.\n\nCrypto trader and investor Scott Melker tweeted, \u201cUkraine has received $50 million in crypto donations. Maybe it\u2019s not just for criminals,\u201d pointing out how nations have erroneously labelled crypto as a tool for illegal activities.\n\nUkraine has received $50m in crypto donations.\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not \u201cjust for criminals.\u201d \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) March 5, 2022\n\nPopular crypto commentator Anthony Pompliano, aka Pomp, also rooted for crypto in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cThis feels like a turning point for fiat currencies globally. A country currently engaged in violent combat to preserve its sovereignty and freedom is publicly soliciting bitcoin and crypto donations. Hard to imagine just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nThis feels like a turning point for fiat currencies globally.\n\n\n\nA country that is currently engaged in violent combat to preserve its sovereignty and freedom is publicly soliciting bitcoin and crypto donations.\n\n\n\nHard to imagine just a few years ago. pic.twitter.com/jgK5BSxBBl \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) February 26, 2022\n\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies have been the easiest and perhaps only alternative for the Ukrainian government to take donations.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s invasion in February, Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, instituted martial law, suspending civil law and extending military rule to civilians, thus making it almost impossible to send and receive fiat currencies.\n\nDespite current events portraying cryptocurrencies in good light, the market has not benefited from the increased popularity.\n\nWithin hours of the invasion, the value of flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, plummeted by 8% \u2014 from $37,000 to $34,000 \u2014 while popular cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana dropped considerably.\n\nHowever, as the conflict lingered and more sanctions were imposed on Russia, the price of Bitcoin soared to about $44,000. Just as traders thought a bull market was on the horizon, the largest crypto by market capitalisation dashed their hopes and fell to less than $39,000.\n\nThe market seemed to crash as the donations rose, probably due to the liquidation of the crypto assets received by Ukraine into fiat.\n\nIn contrast, crypto educator and investor Andy LaPointe told Techpoint Africa that \u201cthe global market cap of crypto is $1.84 trillion; even if all of the donations to Ukraine are sold at once, it wouldn\u2019t negatively affect prices.\u201d\n\nWhile the donations to Ukraine aren\u2019t affecting the crypto market, they are working wonders for crypto PR; consequently, we could see more use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s world\u201d takes on more meaning when funding from venture capitalists to startups founded or led by a woman is considered.\n\nAfrican startups raised approximately $5 billion in 2021, yet less than 1% of the money raised went to startups with a female founder or CEO. This trend also plays out globally, where just 2.3% of funding went to women-led startups in 2020.\n\nOne of the reasons often given for this mismatch is the lack of women as role models. So, we spoke to seven women who have raised at least $1 million from investors over the past three years, and they shared their top money-raising tips.\n\nTarget women-led funds\n\nThere\u2019s no data to back this up, but most of the VCs you\u2019ll meet are men. This is normal as humans are hard-wired to support people who look like them. Naturally and perhaps unconsciously, they end up funding men and only a few women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, it\u2019s getting easier for women to raise money as more women launch venture capital funds targeted at them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an art to fundraising. The first thing that an investor is trying to look for is the founders and team members. There\u2019s a likeability factor there. They need to be able to relate to the founder. The story is different when an all-male team is trying to judge an all-women team,\u201d says Damilola Olokesusi, Founder and CEO of Shuttlers, one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest transport tech startups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola Olokesusi, CEO of Shuttlers. Source: TechCrunch\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop, Founder and CEO of Ejara, a Cameroonian fintech startup, shares the same opinion but warns that simply going after women investors isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cYou should do your due diligence. Don\u2019t think that they\u2019ll be better because they\u2019re women. Most of the women VCs that support women are very vocal about it. Look for those, and your chances will improve.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Chioma Ugo, Co-founder and Head of Growth at fintech startup, Prospa, believes that women should spread their nets wide. Raising funds is often a numbers game, and the more investors you speak to, the more likely you are to get positive responses.\n\n\u201cI will say, talk to as many investors as possible just because the more people you talk to, the higher your chances of raising money,\u201d she says.\n\nSolve a viable problem\n\nInvestors fund businesses to get returns on their investments. Consequently, they always look out for companies that can scale. Therefore, regardless of gender, investors will often invest in businesses that promise generous returns.\n\nJessica Anuna, CEO and Founder of Klasha, believes that having a large market in Nigeria makes it easier to build such businesses for Nigerian entrepreneurs. Her startup provides payment options for businesses in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Founder and CEO of Klasha\n\n\u201cI think that creating a company that solves a problem for a large addressable market is critical for success. Luckily, there are 200 million people in Nigeria, so we have a large addressable market.\n\n\u201cWe also have different problems around the continent that we need to solve given the nascency of digitalisation on our continent.\u201d\n\nOlokesusi shares the same view. Her founding team at Shuttlers were all women. While she says it initially played a role in their difficulty raising money, she believes that solving a big enough problem and gaining traction helped them raise easily.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of your gender, the problem you should be solving must be big enough. That way, even if no one invests, you can still build a business.\u201d\n\nHave the right team\n\nHaving the right team is crucial for any startup, regardless of what stage they\u2019re at. However, with little information for investors to make decisions at the early stages, it often comes down to who is working on a problem.\n\nFor Olokesusi, having an all-women team without experience in the transportation industry and no CTO was a disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChioma Ugo, Co-Founder and Head of Growth, Prospa. Source: FintechTimes\n\n\u201cI know that one other thing that didn\u2019t help at the initial stage was we didn\u2019t have a CTO. At the same time, we needed funds to attract a CTO, so it was a chicken and egg thing.\u201d\n\nAnuna adds that investors are more likely to back founders when they have deep expertise in the industry they\u2019re building in.\n\n\u201cVCs are more likely to back you if you have a history in the field that you want to get into because it proves that you have a track record and understanding of the industry and ecosystem.\u201d\n\nUnderstand what fundraising involves\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a first-time entrepreneur that has a complete grasp of what fundraising entails. Even for more experienced founders, the process can also be nerve-wracking. Unfortunately, there are not enough resources for African founders looking to learn about the fundraising process.\n\nJihan Abass is the Founder and CEO of Lami, an insurtech startup, and she believes that founders need to understand what the fundraising process involves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJihan Abass, CEO and Founder of Lami. Source: TechCabal\n\n\u201cSpeaking to as many women or just founders in general, to understand the process is really helpful. Secondly, understand what you should expect, what is not a good deal. I think you should have those discussions and make sure that you speak with other founders to see what their process was and what deal they got.\u201d\n\nProve that your business works\n\nToo many entrepreneurs start fundraising before they have proven that their ideas work. While some entrepreneurs may raise money for their ideas without proof that it works, that is harder in Africa. Therefore, proving that your business works could improve your chances with investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop, CEO and Founder of Ejara. Source: Blockchain Nigeria Group\n\n\u201cProving the concept is very critical no matter how small it is. So, get your first hundred customers, get your first 500 merchants or whatever it is. That proof of concept is so critical because it helps the VCs buy in. After all, you\u2019ve used your money and resources to show your idea works regardless of if it\u2019s on a small scale or not,\u201d Anuna shares.\n\nTake advantage of intros\n\nThe difference between a founder who raises money and another who struggles is often the successful entrepreneur\u2019s network. Unfortunately, few women work as VCs or founders. Consequently, getting an introduction to an investor could be helpful.\n\n\u201cIntros are always great. For example, suppose I introduce you to an investor that already backed me. In that case, that proves that they back women, and it\u2019s coming from a very reliable source, so obviously, the chances of you raising from that person are heightened,\u201d Ugo says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan McCormick, Co-Founder and CEO of OZ\u00c9. Source: LinkedIn\n\nWhile women have a more challenging time raising money than men, Meghan McCormick, CEO and Co-founder of OZ\u00c9, advises that they take feedback from VCs with scepticism, accepting only what is important.\n\n\u201cWhile raising, it is essential to evaluate the feedback you get from VCs and decide which one to implement. Because when you\u2019re raising money, the VCs are your customers, and you want to be customer-centric. \u201cOn the other hand, you should also take it with a grain of salt and not role-play what you think a male founder will act like or say because you think that will be more successful in getting you money.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "The lingering scarcity of JET A-1, also known as aviation fuel, may force airlines in Nigeria to stop using big planes and turn to smaller aircraft to conserve fuel, industry stakeholders have said.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that airlines were already recording low bookings following the increase in airfares. As a result, airlines with bigger planes fly half full, leading to increased operational costs.\n\nFindings show that older and bigger aircraft cost airlines more on maintenance, operations and fuel consumption than smaller and younger ones.\n\nThe Airline Operators of Nigeria recently lamented that the price of aviation fuel, which was around N280-290 per litre in December, had risen to more than N410 in Lagos, N422 in Abuja and Port Harcourt, and N429 in Kano.\n\nThey said on top of the continued rise in the price, the supply of aviation fuel at several airports had been inadequate, thereby causing delays.\n\nThey said sometimes, airlines had to wait for fuel to be supplied at airports across the country.\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that if the scarcity persisted, airlines might delay, cancel and merge flights.\n\nHe said fares might not increase because there was already a 100 percent increase in fares.\n\nAccording to him, there are indications that airlines with big planes will pack their planes and use smaller planes that are fuel-efficient.\n\nRead also: Airfare hike: Commission commence investigations, says law prohibits airlines\u2019 action\n\nAirlines with leased aircraft may return them to their owners, pending when the scarcity would end, to avoid accumulating costs, he added.\n\n\u201cAirlines with leased aircraft may no longer afford the money to pay to their lessors; so it may be best for them to either return these aircraft or renegotiate contracts with partners,\u201d he said.\n\nDana Air, which has the biggest aircraft operated by a domestic carrier in Nigeria, apologised to its customers last Thursday for recent flight delays, citing fuel scarcity as reason for the delay.\n\nThe airline said it was working with its partners to significantly mitigate the challenge, adding that it had made major inroads in this area with its key suppliers.\n\nIt said it would continue to do its best to minimise any foreseeable challenges while hoping that the situation improves generally for all carriers as soon as possible.\n\nThe airline said, \u201cWe admit that we have been falling short on this commitment in the last few days and not living up to our promise to offer a reliable schedule and on-time performance that we have come to be known for.\n\n\u201cWe accept that our recent disruptions due to ramp congestion, bad weather, and most recently, scarcity of fuel, would have affected your plans.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay had earlier reported that as maintenance and operating costs of airlines kept rising, airlines were buying smaller, fuel-efficient and low-age aircraft in a bid to bring down the cost of operations.\n\nFindings show that airlines are gradually shifting from buying big aircraft such as Boeing 737, Boeing 727, Boeing 747, and MD 83 to smaller and more fuel-efficient aircraft such as ERJ 145 hopper jets, Embraer 195-E2, BRJ-900, and Dash 8-400 for domestic and regional operations.\n\nSeyi Adewale, chief executive officer at Mainstream Cargo Limited, told BusinessDay that the relative instability being experienced in the sector had allowed domestic airline operators (or managers) to understand the business side of aviation and to develop smarter strategies to operate more efficiently and profitably.\n\nAdewale said the recent aircraft purchase types and orders revealed a shift towards buying aircraft types with good fuel efficiency, better seat (space) management, lower age, and smaller cargo hold.\n\nAccording to him, the advantages of having a low-cost business ideology and operating model is that it gives passengers alternatives, especially those that are cost-sensitive, quick turnaround due to reduced \u2018niceties\u2019 and passenger numbers and more routes.",

And we can see the crisis that we had in the House. It was possible because we did not have a woman there.\n\n\u201cSo, we have learned our lesson, and this election, you don\u2019t need to preach to us. I will go out there to campaign and more women will be elected into our State House of Assembly. The crisis we had may have been avoided if we have more voices of reasoning in that House.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, women get ready. You know how we do it; you know we moved from ward to ward, and will do that again in a few months\u2019 time. Rest assured that our government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow you to achieve your goals,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe governor, who flayed the National Assembly for rejecting bills seeking affirmative action and inclusion of women in politics and other spheres of the society, noted that \u201cthe action of the National Assembly should serve as a turning point in our history and should spur you, women, to mobilize Nigerians for gender equality and to break the bias; do not despair.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cToday\u2019s celebration would have been an epic one if the National Assembly had set aside all unfounded misgivings and biases to justify their refusal to constructive debates and approved the bills to alter the provisions of our constitution to provide affirmative action for women in our political administration and other related matters.\n\n\u201cIf they had done the right thing, today, we would have all rolled out the drums to celebrate them for such resolute display of progressive change, but unfortunately, they refused. Rather, today, we are all going to carry placards across the country to commence protest which will force those we voted to represent our interests to do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only leaders understand and appreciate the exceptional competence and leadership abilities of women, there will be no conversation about giving women the opportunity and responsibility in government,\u201d the governor added.\n\nSpeaking on efforts to end all forms of gender bias in Edo, Obaseki said, \u201cIn Edo, we are clear. We have seen how women have contributed to making major differences in our lives. If we say we want to make Edo great again, then, the women must be at the forefront.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Besty Obaseki, who was represented by the wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Maryann Shaibu, also berated the National Assembly for not giving approval to the five gender bills.\n\nIn her opening remarks, the Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, Mrs. Maria Edeko commended Obaseki and the Edo State House of Assembly for showing support for women as evidenced by the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Law.\n\nThe Commissioner noted, \u201cThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is a call on political leaders to show support for women so that a large number of them would be elected as state and national assembly members.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

the \u2018governor\u2019 and \u2018deputy governor\u2019 of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe party which took the decision on Tuesday, following the sack of David Umahi, governor of the state by an Abuja High Court.\n\nUmahi, has, however maintained that he remained governor of the state despite the court ruling.\n\nThe PDP which announced the development in a post via its twitter handle, @OfficialPDPNig on Tuesday evening, said \u201cFollowing the removal of Gov Dave Umahi & his Deputy Mr. Igwe of Ebonyi state, and in line with the directives of the court, the PDP has submitted to INEC the names of Iduma Igariwe and Fred Udogwu as the new Gov and Deputy Gov of Ebonyi State.\u201d\n\nBreaking News:\n\nFollowing the removal of Gov Dave Umahi & his Deputy Mr. Igwe of Ebonyi state, and in line with

Official PDP Nigeria (@OfficialPDPNig) March 8, 2022\n\nRecall that Umahi, the deputy governor of Ebonyi, Dr. Kelechi Igwe and 17 members of the state house of assembly were on Tuesday, sacked by an Abuja High Court for defecting to the All Progressive Congress.\n\nThe Ebonyi governor who won a second term seat as governor of Ebonyi under the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019, defected to the APC in November 2020, alongside the deputy governor of the state, Kelechi Igwe and 17 members of the state house of assembly, all of whom were sacked by the Abuja High Court on Tuesday.\n\nThe court had in a judgement delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo, held that the total number of 393, 042 votes governor Umahi secured during the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Ebonyi state, belonged to the PDP and same could not be legally transferred to the APC.\n\nAccording to the court, having defected to the APC, both Umahi and his deputy, not only jettisoned the PDP, but also the votes that belonged to it.\n\nIt held that going by the outcome of the governorship election, the office of the governor and deputy governor in Ebonyi state, \u201cbelong to the Plaintiff and no other politcal party\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no constitutional provision that made the ballot transferrable from one party to the other\u201d.\n\nIt held that the PDP is bound to retain the votes and mandate that was given to it by electorates in Ebonyi state, as both governor Umahi and his Deputy could not validly transfer same to APC.\n\nThe court therefore ordered both Umahi and Igwe to immediately vacate their positions.\n\nIt ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to immediately receive from the PDP, names of persons to replace Umahi and his Deputy, or in the alternative, conduct fresh gubernatorial election in Ebonyi state in line with section 177(c) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nThe court further restraining both Umahi and Igwe from further parading themselves as governor or deputy governor of Ebonyi state.\n\nIn the case of the 17 lawmakers also sacked on Tuesday, Justice Ekwo held that the lawmakers, having abandoned the political party that sponsored them, could not transfer the mandate they obtained from the ballot to another political party.\n\nThe court held that the Defendants who became members of House of Assembly on the platform of the PDP, could not justify their defection when there was no division in the PDP.\n\nIt held that section 109(1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution was purposely couched to ensure that defectors were not allowed to retain their seat in the House, unless such defectors are able to justify their action.\n\nConsequently, it ordered the lawmakers to immediately vacate their positions, even as it restrained them from further parading themselves or acting as members of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly.\n\nThe court also made an order of mandatory injunction compelling the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to accept from the PDP, a list of its candidates to replace the sacked lawmakers, as well as to issue Certificate of Return to them.\n\nAlternately, the court directed INEC to within 90 days, conduct fresh election in Ebonyi State to fill up the vacant positions.\n\nIt further ordered all the lawmakers to refund all salaries and monies they received from the period they defected to the APC.\n\nI remain Ebonyi governor \u2013 Umahi\n\nMeanwhile, Umahi governor of Ebonyi State, on Tuesday stressed that he remains the Governor of the State not minding the ruling by the Federal High Court, Abuja\n\nBriefing Newsmen in his office at the new Government House, Abakaliki, Governor Umahi who described the ruling as \u201cjungle justice that was purchased\u201d noted that the ruling was not a good development for the Judiciary\n\nThe judgement, by implication, means that governors of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle who defected to the APC from the PDP in June 2021, along with the state\u2019s lawmakers, and Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade who did same in May last year, may suffer similar fate.\n\nControversy has continued over whether or not elected officials who abandon their parties should vacate the seats won on the platform of the parties they abandoned.\n\nThe controversy stems from the fact that Nigeria\u2019s constitution is not expressly clear on the matter.\n\nSection 180(1) of the Constitution encapsulates the circumstances in which a governor may vacate his office as follows: (i) When his successor in office takes his oath of that office or, (ii) he dies while holding such office or, (iii) the date when his resignation from office takes effect or, (iv) he otherwise ceases to hold office in accordance with provisions of the Constitution.\n\nSection 180 (2) provides as follows: \u201csubject to the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section, the governor shall vacate his office at the expiration of period of four years commencing from the date when: (a) In the case of a person first elected as governor under this Constitution, he took the oath of allegiance and oath of office. (b) The person last elected to that office took the oath of allegiance and oath of office or would, but for his death, have taken such oaths.\n\nBut it does not say much or anything about a governor who abandons his party for another.\n\nIn 2009, a Federal High Court, Gusau, Zamfara dismissed a suit challenging the defection of then governor of the state, Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi the deputy governor, Mukhtar Anka from the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to the PDP.\n\nBoth politicians were elected and sworn in on the platform of the ANPP but defected to the then ruling party.\n\nThe court had held that the action of the defendants was not illegal going by the provisions of the 1999 constitution and past verdicts of the Supreme Court.\n\nDelivering judgment in the case filed by the ANPP, seeking an order to force Shinkafi and his deputy to vacate their offices, Justice Adamu Bello held that the reliefs being sought by the plaintiffs were political problems that could be solved in the political arena and not in the courts.\n\n\u201cAs such, the plaintiffs should have considered taking this case to the State House of Assembly where the members, if fully convinced of the respondents\u2019 misdemeanor if any, can impeach them in accordance with the law,\u201d he had stated.\n\nJustice Bello further ruled that he could not in any circumstance take away the mandate of the respondents. They could vacate office if they choose to resign or they die; they are unable to perform their functions due to infirmity of the mind; they were impeached by the State House of Assembly, he explained.\n\nBello had said that section 177 of the 1999 constitution clearly states that a person shall only be qualified for election into the office of the governor of the state if he is a member of a political party and sponsored by a political party. He also explained that the same constitution did not state that such a person cannot leave that party after achieving electoral victory.\n\nHe had also pointed out that Section 68(1) (g) and (2), and 109 (1g) and (2) only makes provisions for the tenure of members of the legislature and not that of the executive.\n\nHe had argued that the case between former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and the Attorney General of the Federation decided by the Supreme Court could also be applied in this case, in that the court held that a person sponsored by a political party to power could leave the same party to another without breaching any section of the constitution.\n\nBello then ruled that resigning from a political party is not the same as resigning from office as governor or deputy governor. He added that he had no power to declare the seats of the respondents vacant.\n\nThe decision of the Abuja High Court regarding Umahi, is therefore a departure from this initial judgment, and will set the stage for legal fireworks, even as the Matawalle and Ayade must be keeping a close eye on proceedings.\n\nI remain Ebonyi governor \u2013 Umahi\n\nMeanwhile, Umahi governor of Ebonyi State, on Tuesday stressed that he remains the Governor of the State not minding the ruling by the Federal High Court, Abuja\n\nBriefing Newsmen in his office at the new Government House, Abakaliki, Governor Umahi who described the ruling as \u201cjungle justice that was purchased\u201d noted that the ruling was not a good development for the Judiciary\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Traditional and religious rulers in the South East yesterday urged the presidency and state governors not to relent in consolidating peace building efforts over the security challenges in the region.\n\nThe council of Traditional rulers and representatives of the Igbo Archbishops and bishops stated this in a joint statement made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday.\n\nTraditional rulers who signed the statement include, H.M. Igwe Charles Mkpuma\n\nchairman, Ebonyi State Trad. Rulers Council & chairman, South East Council of Traditional Rulers; H.M. Eze Joseph N. Nwabeke Chairman, Abia State Trad. Rulers Council; H.M. Obi Nnaemeka Achebe, CFR Chairman, Anambra State Trad. Rulers Council.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOthers are, H.M. Igwe Amb L. O. C. Agubuzu, OON Chairman, Enugu State Trad. Rulers Council; H.M. Eze Dr. E. C. Okeke chairman, Imo State Trad. Rulers Council.\n\nThe religious leaders who signed the state are Most Rev. Dr. Anthony J. V. Obinna, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Owerri; Most Rev. Dr Emmanuel O. Chukwuma, OON, Anglican Archbishop of Enugu; Most Rev. Dr. Chibuzo R. Opoko, TFG, DOB, JP, Methodist Archbishop of Umuahia;\n\nOthers are, Most Rev. Dr. Valerian M. Okeke, Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha;\n\nMost Rev. Dr Uma A. Onwunta, Past Principal Clerk Presbyterian Church Nigeria; and Bishop Obi Onubogu Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe leaders who lamented that security situation in the region, decried the failure of the presidency and state governors to follow up with peace-building efforts in order to finally address the security crisis in the south east.\n\nThey recalled how they had intervened in the past to douse security tension especially with the conduct of the Anambra Election and the IPOB sit-at-home order.\n\nThey noted that three months since they wrote the office of the president to consolidate on the peace effort, there has been no response.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to sustain the momentum gained, on November 3, 2021, the Joint Body wrote a letter to the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), requesting an audience.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the request was to dialogue and explore avenues for peace-building, douse the tension in the South East to ensure it does not result in grave socio-economic burden on our people.\n\n\u201cThe joint Body fears that further delay or inaction on this request may have the unintended consequence of giving credence, albeit erroneously, to the belief by some groups in the region that restoring peace and stability is not the primary goal of the Federal Government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, genuine efforts made through the Chairman, South East Governors\u2019 Forum to dialogue with South East Governors have so far also met a brick wall. Taken together, the shuttered silence gives room for suspicion and presents ominous portends if left unattended to.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Body is not unmindful of widely reported visit of a group led by the Elder Statesman, Pa Mbazulike Amechi. However, the absence of any discernible genuine effort at peace building as well as the silence of the Presidency on our request for constructive engagement would further seem to give credence to the suspicion in some quarters of a clear lack of strong commitment to peace building and resolution of security challenges in the South East.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is puzzling that the President and the South East Governors appear to be ignoring the demonstrated value of dialogue and consensus-building in finding a lasting solution to the region\u2019s security issues.\n\n\u201cAs leaders who are continuously required by our burden of service to interface with the populace, the Joint Body is desirous of confirming the sincerity and commitment of the Federal Government, in particular, to finding a lasting solution to the security crisis.\u201d",

          "text": "As the world marks yet another International Women\u2019s Day on March 8, 2022, with the campaign theme #BreaktheBias, Project Alert on Violence Against Women cannot but note the extreme bias and discrimination against women in Nigeria by federal legislators at the recent plenary session during which they voted on 68 bills seeking to amend the 1999 constitution. The legislators (95.5% men) voted against bills seeking to end gender discrimination in the constitution such as citizenship for foreign husbands of Nigerian women; \u201cstatelessness\u201d I of married Nigerian women; 35% affirmative action in party administration & leadership; 35% political appointment positions for women; diaspora voting etc.\n\nThe actions of the federal legislators speaks volume about the roll back Nigerian women are experiencing in promoting and protecting their rights, and achieving gender equality and equity. Nigeria cannot make progress without its women and girls.\n\nProject Alert on Violence Against Women along with several other women\u2019s rights and human rights organizations have over the years and decades advocated for and made progress in promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls. We have come a long way and will not allow the 9th National Assembly and its legislators, take us back. They must #BreaktheBias against Nigerian women.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme, #BreakingtheBias is a wake-up call and places responsibility on society and the world as a whole to call out various forms of gender bias, gender stereotypes, and inequality in society, and work towards addressing them. We should collectively help create an all-encompassing world where women and men are equally represented and equally treated.\n\nFor us at Project Alert the theme for this year\u2019s IWD resonates as we work with community groups to break the barriers and bias against ending violence against women and girls. We have set up SGBV Community surveillance teams in about fifteen LGAs in Lagos, and eight (8) in Sokoto. These has been done with support from the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative Project and the African Women Development Fund, AWDF.\n\nThe surveillance teams made up of men and women in the communities, have been taken the lead in reaching out to various stakeholders, individuals and families in their respective communities. Indeed #BreaktheBias they are doing.\n\nWe are on this day launching a social media video on sexual and gender-based violence to publicise the great work these teams are doing in 3 local government areas in Lagos \u2013 Apapa, Mushin and Ifako-Ijaiye.\n\nWe encourage the Nigerian government and our legislators in particular, to note the important work being done by ordinary citizens to #BreaktheBias and encourage rather than discourage them by voting discriminatorily against women. We use this day to call for a renewed sense of dedication and commitment as we collectively as a nation, continue to strive to empower women and girls.\n\nWe will continue to emphasize that women should exercise their rights fully, use their voices freely, determine their life outcomes, and live their lives free from intimidation, harassment, and violence.\n\nThe world will definitely be a better place without gender bias.\n\nJosephine Effah-Chukwuma\n\nExecutive Director.",

          "text": "There was a reign of confusion in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Monday over who heads the party\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) between Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni and his Niger counterpart, Abubakar Sani-Bello.\n\nSani-Bello is one of the two governors on the committee.\n\nWhile he represents the North-central, his Osun counterpart, Isiaka Oyetola represents the South-west interest on the committee.\n\nWhile Governor Buni, who has been on the saddle for about 20 months is currently outside the country for a medical treatment, the Niger state governor said he had the blessing of President Muhammadu Buhari to lead the party in acting capacity.\n\nHowever, National Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement Monday in Abuja, declared no change in party leadership.\n\nBello announces takeover\n\nAddressing journalists after a closed-door meeting with other members of the CECPC Monday in Abuja, Governor Sani-Bello confirmed his position as the acting chairman of the party\u2019s CECPC.\n\nAt the meeting were the women representative in the CECPC, Stella Okotete, the youth leader, Ismail Ahmed, Mr David Lyon, Professor Tahir Mamman, Senator Ali Abba, Senator Ken Nnamani, Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf and Akpanudoedehe.\n\nAnd as a further confirmation of his new status as acting chairman, Governor Bello inaugurated and conducted the swearing-in of party state chairmen elected 2021.\n\nHe also received the report of the Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazak-led 8-man zoning committee to be adopted for the forthcoming national convention.\n\nBello said he had been acting for a while in the absence of the caretaker committee chairman, Governor Buni since travelling out.\n\n\u2026Inaugurates state party chairs, receives zoning report\n\nAsked what transpired at the closed-door meeting, Bello said: \u201cThere are some activities that happened here today as part of activities going forward to our convention. We just received the report of the zoning committee headed by the governor of Kwara State and the Deputy Senate President.\n\n\u201cThe state chairmen took their oath of office today and we discussed progress made so far on convention and what needs to be done next so that we will achieve the March 26 date for Convention.\u201d\n\nAsked in what capacity did he preside over the meeting, the Niger governor said: \u201cI have been acting for a while since the chairman travelled.\u201d\n\nSani-Bello also said he would be coming to the party secretariat \u201calmost every day\u201d now to carry out his duties as the new party helmsman.\n\nThe acting chairman who left the party secretariat after the swearing-in ceremony of the state chairmen, had to return to receive the report of the Abdulrazak\u2019s zoning committee.\n\nThe brief ceremony had in attendance governors of Lagos state \u2013 Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Ogun-Dapo Abiodun; Imo-Hope Uzodinma; Kogi-Yahaya Bello; Borno-Babagana Zulum and Gombe-Inuwa Yahaya as well as the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nCommenting on the presence of some governors at the national secretariat, Sani-Bello said: \u201cMost of my colleagues are here to support me to receive the report. You know the zoning committee report is a very important one and all the governors are here to support me.\u201d\n\nOn the status and position of Buni in the scheme of things in the caretaker committee, Sani- Bello said: \u201cI am not aware of his position at this moment. I know he has travelled.\u201d\n\nNo change in leadership \u2013 Akpanudoedehe\n\nEarlier in a statement, Senator Akpanudoedehe described the report in a section of the media that Governor Sani-Bello had taken over the party leadership as fake news.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\n\u201cThe media report is fake news and should be disregarded. The APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by \u2018sources\u2019 through name dropping in the media.\n\n\u201cWe urge our teeming supporters, members and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party.\u201d\n\nBut another top party source believed to be close to Governor Buni said the seeming takeover was occasioned by Buni\u2019s decision to hand over the party leadership to the secretary while travelling even when there are two governors on the committee.\n\n\u201cWell, to the best of my knowledge, Governor Buni handed over to the CECPC Secretary while he was travelling out of the country. Did you hear him (Bello) say he was in acting capacity? I think the problem here is that the angst came about because Governor Buni handed over the rein of the party leadership to the secretary which didn\u2019t go down well with some people who saw it as an act of disrespect when there are two governors there as members.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd even at that, one may want to ask: on whose directive did Governor Bello step in as acting chairman? Well, in the next two or three days, the coast will be clear,\u201d said the source who consistently pleaded anonymity.\n\nBuni, scribe to resign?\n\nBlueprint, however, learnt that Governor Buni and the CECPC secretary may resign today (Tuesday) from the APC National Caretaker Committee, leaving behind other members.\n\nA senior member of the party told this newspaper that the president had actually ordered that Governor Buni and Senator Akpanudoedehe step aside while Governor Sani-Bello and someone else among other members emerge as chairman and secretary respectively.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWith all that is playing out now, Governor Buni and the CECPC Secretary might have been pressured and they might tender their resignation on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nBadaru on Adamu\n\nIn a related development, Jigawa state Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar has denied reports that President Buhari endorsed Senator Abdullahi Adamu for the position of the national chairman of the APC.\n\nGovernor Badaru made the clarification while fielding questions on the BBC Hausa Service, monitored in Abuja Monday.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the meeting held between the APC governors and President Buhari, the Jigawa governor confirmed that the meeting held but that Buhari did not endorse any particular candidate at the meeting.\n\nResponding to the reporter\u2019s inquiry, Badaru said: \u201cBuhari did not endorse Senator Abdullahi Adamu. He only expressed his desire for the party to agree on a consensus candidate and that the North-central should produce the national chairman.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the insinuations that agitations for the position of the national chairman may have divided the APC, saying the governors of the APC were united and would work together to actualise Buhari\u2019s vision for the party.\n\n\u201cWe are not divided. We are awaiting directives from our leader, President Buhari and whatever direction he gives us, we will follow accordingly,\u201d he stated.\n\nGovernor Badaru further denied allegations that himself, governors of Kebbi and Kaduna states were bent on causing problems for the party ahead of the March 26 national convention.",

He added that they did not address the issue of defection rightly and frontally but rather resorted to general denial to affidavit evidence.\n\nJustice Ekwo said the defendants in their counter affidavit were \u201cevasive and insufficient\u201d to competently challenge the Plaintiff\u2019s originating process.\n\nIt was the opinion of the court that the \u201cImmunity Clause\u201d in section 308 of the Constitution is not absolute.\n\nThe court ruled that \u201cSection 308 is a veritable constitutional shield\u201d and not for political reasons.\n\nJustice Inyang said Umahi and Igwe did not controvert the deposition that total votes scored in an election belong to a political party.\n\nHe stated that there was enough evidence to show that the 2nd defendant (APC) contested the Ebonyi State Governorship election held on March 2019, with its own candidates.\n\n\u201cIt can be noted that the Constitution does not deal with the issue of defection lightly,\u201d the court stated.\n\n\u201cThe 3rd and 4th defendants cannot transfer the votes and victory of the Plaintiff on March 9, 2019, to the APC. The office of the Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi state belongs to the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe option for Umahi and Igwe is to vacate office and wait for next election to contest election under the platform of its new party,\u201d the court declared.\n\nThe court said the act of the APC, Umahi and his deputy is aimed at dismantling the 1999 Constitution.\n\nConsequently, the court declared that under the democratic system operated in Nigeria, the plaintiff won the majority of votes during the election and is entitled to enjoy same till the end of tenure of office for which the election was made.",

          "text": "Nigeria and Bangladesh top two counties to benefit from United Kingdom\u2019s new global partnership with 11 businesses to improve girls\u2019 access to education and employment\n\nThe new global partnership was launched British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to mark International Women\u2019s Day celebrated on Tuesday.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAccording to a statement on Tuesday by the British High Commission in Abuja, countries like Nigeria and Bangladesh, two countries where significant barriers to girls\u2019 education remain, will be one of the first to benefit from the fund. The Statement revealed that UK Government is contributing an initial \u00a39m (4.89 billion Naira) , with businesses providing \u00a311m (5.98 billion Naira) in total, with the programme aiming to provide high quality skills training to around 1 million girls around the world; noting that improving girls\u2019 access to education is a key part of the UK\u2019s foreign policy, to ensure we build back better from the pandemic and prevent a lost generation, insisting that investing in education helps lift communities out of poverty and protects girls from early marriage, forced labour and gender-based violence.\n\nThe statement said Prime Minister Boris Johnson is launching a new \u00a320m business partnership as the UK continues to lead global efforts to improve girls\u2019 access to education in developing countries.\n\nThe statement added that even before the COVID pandemic, millions of children did not have any access to school \u2013 and girls from disadvantaged families are particularly vulnerable to missing out on education, whether through poverty or prejudice. The pandemic has created even more barriers to education, with a peak of 1.6 billion children around the world having faced school closures.\n\nIt revealed that In the UK\u2019s first education partnership of its kind, the UK Government is joining forces with the private sector to boost girls\u2019 access to education in developing countries. Partners include Accenture, BP, Cognizant, Coursera,\n\nMicrosoft, Pearson, PwC, Standard Chartered, Unilever, United Bank for Africa and Vodafone.\n\nThe UK Government will be working in partnership with UNICEF\u2019s Generation Unlimited (GenU) to help deliver the programme, with key partners funding GenU being Accenture, Microsoft, Standard Chartered, Unilever, and United Bank of Africa.\n\nOn 7 March, a reception was held at No10 Downing Street to mark the announcement ahead of the 8 March 2022 International Women\u2019s Day. The event was attended by partners including: Jill Huntley, Global Managing Director, Corporate Citizenship at Accenture;\n\nDr Betty Vandenbosch, Chief Content Officer at Coursera and Marissa Thomas, Chief Operating Officer at PwC.\n\nAt the event, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \u201cThe United Kingdom has long been a proud and mighty champion of this fundamental cause and today we take one leap further through our first Global Partnership of its kind \u2013 opening the opportunity for one million girls across\n\nthe developing world to have access to high quality skills training.\n\n\u201cEnsuring every girl and young woman across the globe receives 12 years of quality education is the greatest tool in our armoury to end the world\u2019s great injustices.\n\n\u201cDelivering on this mission will be one of the best defences against ignorance, ensure the greatest protection from prejudice and put a rocket booster behind our hopes and dreams for global development in the years to come.\u201d\n\nBusinesses, charities, schools and colleges will shortly be able to bid for funds from the programme. The partnership wants to support projects that will improve access to education for girls, with a focus on providing the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills needed to find work in key sectors such as technology and manufacturing. This could include funding new skills training programmes, improving teaching or redesigning training to make it more relevant to business needs. Initially bids will be encouraged for projects in Nigeria and Bangladesh, two countries where significant barriers to girls\u2019 education remain.\n\nFunding from the programme will also help expand GenU\u2019s `Passport to Earning\u2019 (P2E) platform. This digital skills platform will provide girls with free, certified education and skills training which they can then use to support future\n\nemployment and entrepreneurship opportunities. UNICEF\u2019s precursor to P2E was listed among Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Best Inventions of 2021.\n\nSome of the businesses involved will be contributing a range of resources including books, computers and other technology, mentors, advice and access to their networks, skills and training programmes. The private sector involvement will help ensure that education and learning opportunities provide girls with the skills for the future that employers need.\n\nThe UK is playing a leading global role to improve girls\u2019 education in developing countries. During the UK\u2019s G7 Presidency last year it secured agreement to help get an additional 40 million girls into school by 2026; and secondly to help 20 million girls to learn to read by the age of 10 by 2026. In 2021, the UK hosted a successful Global Education Summit, which raised $4 billion in pledges from world leaders to support schools through the Global Partnership for Education. Between 2015 and 2020, the UK supported at least 15.6 million children in developing countries to gain a decent education, including 8.1 million girls.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cWe have already seen considerable success with similar skills programmes such as the Alternative Learning Program (ALP) in Bangladesh. This involved training up marginalised young girls with the skills they needed to be able to secure jobs within demand sectors, which gave these young girls more economic, social and personal freedom. As a result, the programme saw a 62% reduction in child marriage among the girls and families involved.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the \u2018Educate!\u2019 programme across Uganda and Rwanda has provided industry-specific (agriculture and tourism) sessions for girls, as well as sessions to boost their literacy skills. This programme saw a 120% increase in income\n\namong the female participants.\u201d\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss said: lSupporting women and girls is at the heart of UK foreign policy. We want women to have agency over their own lives and to be free to succeed.\n\n\u201cInvesting in girls\u2019 education is vital for a more sustainable, peaceful and prosperous future. That\u2019s why we are partnering with the private sector to help girls in developing countries access education and job opportunities.\u201d\n\nHelen Grant, Prime Minister\u2019s Special Envoy for Girls\u2019 Education said: \u201cEvery girl everywhere deserves to have an education. From school right the way through to the workplace, our partnership will help give women and girls the skills they need to reach their full potential.\u201d\n\nKevin Frey, Chief Executive Officer of Generation Unlimited said: \u201cThe Girls\u2019 Education Skills Partnership exemplifies the commitment of the UK government and the private sector in addressing the critical gap in skilling girls for 21st Century opportunities.\n\n\u201cP2E is an innovative skills platform designed with partners to reach the girls everywhere, every time, preparing them with in-demand market relevant skills.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n",
