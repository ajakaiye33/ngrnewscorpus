          "title": "China\u2019s common prosperity has African significance by Chu Maoming, China\u2019s Consul General in Lagos",
          "text": "China has made it clear that we strive for more visible and substantive progress in the well-rounded development of individuals and common prosperity of the entire population.\n\nThe Resolution of the CPC (Communist Party of China) Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century adopted last November at the sixth plenary session of its 19th Central Committee reiterates that China will promote common prosperity for all people. The phrase common prosperity has gained prominence as China is determined to bring better lives to more people.\n\nWhat does common prosperity mean? What significance does it have for Africa?\n\nGenerations of the CPC\u2019s top leaders attached great importance to common prosperity. It was first mentioned in the 1950s by Chairman Mao Zedong, and repeated in the 1980s by Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China\u2019s reform and opening-up policy. Since 2013, President Xi Jinping has expressed a heightened commitment to delivering common prosperity, emphasizing it is not just an economic objective but core to the CPC\u2019s governing foundation.\n\nAfter winning the anti-poverty fight and completing the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, China now has favorable conditions for promoting common prosperity. More tangible progress toward common prosperity has been listed as one of China\u2019s key long-term targets through 2035 when the country is expected to achieve basic modernization.\n\nCommon prosperity does not mean building an egalitarian or a welfare state. It is by no means robbing the rich to help the poor as misinterpreted by some Western observers. According to President Xi Jinping\u2019s speech delivered at the 2022 World Economic Forum Virtual Session, \u201cthe common prosperity we desire is not egalitarianism. To use an analogy, we will first make the pie bigger, and then divide it properly through reasonable institutional arrangements. As a rising tide lifts all boats, everyone will get a fair share from development, and development gains will benefit all our people in a more substantial and equitable way.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, the Chinese government has pursued the common prosperity agenda with a series of reforms. Important gateways to common prosperity include the adjustment of overly high incomes through channels such as taxes, more help for low-income groups through the provision of stronger public benefits and the expansion of the middle-income group. China has also intensified efforts to crack down on monopolies, curbed the disorderly expansion of capital, reined in the red-hot housing market, and stepped up supervision of the entertainment and education sectors. All such moves aim to promote the healthier and more sustainable development of the industries. Meanwhile, China has adopted measures to reduce development gaps between wealthier and poorer areas, as well as between urban and rural regions, through economic upgrading and more investment in local businesses.\n\nEchoing the government\u2019s call for common prosperity, big enterprises and business leaders in China have taken the initiative to share their profits for the common good by making donations and providing social supports to narrow income disparities.\n\nFor common prosperity, China aims to increase the size of middle-income groups and create an olive-shaped income pattern. China\u2019s middle-income group has increased from over 100 million in 2010 to more than 400 million in 2019, accounting for about 30 percent of the total population. Per capita disposable income rose from 19,109 yuan (about 3,004 U.S. dollars) in 2010 to 32,000 yuan in 2020, surging 67.46 percent during the decade. With the advancement of common prosperity, the number of middle-income earners is expected to grow, creating enormous demand for high-quality products and services and thus presenting business opportunities for companies from the rest of the world, including Africa.\n\nChina, in its cooperation with Africa, has always honored its commitment and worked in a practical and efficient manner. China is the largest developing country, and Africa is the continent with the largest number of developing countries. The mutual assistance between the two sides when they are pursuing economic development and national rejuvenation will help enhance the common welfare of the 2.7 billion people in both China and Africa. Concrete actions have been put in place to implement the outcomes of the 8th Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which are deepening and substantiating the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.\n\nChina has always been following the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests in its cooperation with Africa. The two sides have built over 10,000 kilometers of railways, nearly 100,000 kilometers of highways, nearly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, as well as a large number of hospitals and schools. As long as China and Africa keep maintaining their solidarity and cooperation, they will definitely explore a new path for developing countries to achieve modernization and common prosperity.\n\nThe spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation, which features sincere friendship and equality, win-win for mutual benefit and common development, fairness and justice, and progress with the times and openness and inclusiveness, will be carried on from generation to generation. Joining hands for modernization and the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, China and Africa will surely write a glorious chapter in the history of human civilization.",

          "text": "\u2026Say we\u2019ve not had it this bad\n\n\u2026As hunters hold security meetings to curb bandits\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon, LAGOS\n\nFOLLOWING resurgence of kidnap attempts in the South-West, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, and the Senior Elders Forum of the Yoruba Council of Elders, YCE, yesterday, said that the 2023 general elections may not hold in the zone.\n\nThis came as the Soludero Hunters Association of Nigeria has concluded plans to hold an all-inclusive security meeting to check the security threats in the South-West.\n\nBoth Afenifere and YCE lamented that the South-West has not had it this bad, as regards insecurity.\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said that the recent kidnapping of seven people around Isara-Remo on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on Sunday, January 16, 2022, was another evidence that governments in Nigeria have failed in their primary duties of providing security and welfare for the people.\n\nAjayi said: \u201cWe recall the incessant kidnapping of and attacks on innocent people in Ondo, Ogun, Osun and Ekiti states. We also recall the sacking of certain villages in Imeko area of Ogun State, last week. These are unacceptable and must be stopped forthwith by all means.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nN1bn compensation to Nnamdi Kanu: We\u2019ll respond after studying judgement \u2013 Army\n\n\u201cThe lamentations by governors of Niger, Zamfara, Benue, Nassarawa, Borno, Kaduna, Sokoto and Katsina states on how terrorists seem to be dictating the pace in their areas ought to serve as a wake-up call for the governments and the security agencies.\n\n\u201cAfenifere acknowledged that President Muhammadu Buhari was aware of the security situation going by his recent expressions on the issue. For instance, the President ordered for robust military intervention in the wake of terrorists\u2019 take-over of some local government areas in Niger State just as he asked Nigerians to put their prayers for security before God.\n\n\u201cSeveral orders have been given by Mr President in the recent past just as Nigerians never stopped praying. But it looks as if the more orders are given and prayers are said, the worse our security situation becomes.\n\n\u201cThis clearly shows that the appropriate panacea is not being applied to the scourge. And until this is done, the situation may be getting worse each passing day.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s approach to the issue does not indicate that it grasps the enormity of the problem hence it is treating the insecurity situation as though it were a circus.\n\n\u201cAs part of the immediate solutions to the problem, the doctrine of necessity be invoked so that the aspect of the Constitution that makes the handling of security in the country almost exclusive to the Federal Government would be relaxed.\n\n\u201cThis is the time that states and local government councils must be legally allowed to have their security agencies. Such states and local government security agencies must be fully equipped and be allowed to have the powers to investigate and prosecute accordingly.\n\nAlso, states\u2019 laws on security, including anti-open grazing laws, must be allowed to be effectively enforced.\n\n\u201cNo matter the stride President Buhari made on the Nigeria project, the worsening security and economic conditions in the country would rubbish his efforts and ultimate achievements.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, incumbent on the President to allow State Police, strengthen the military with equipment and right motivation, prevail on the Attorney General to allow rule of law to operate without fear or favour, stop the nepotistic justice, enable the military to mop-up too many weapons in the hands of unauthorised persons and promptly convene a meeting of ethnic nationalities and interest groups. Such a meeting should be to return the country to a true Federation with perhaps a parliamentary system of government.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the elders, who spoke through a former National President of YCE, Col Samuel Agbede, retd, said there is a strong feeling that the general elections may not take place at all unless the trend of insecurity is urgently addressed.\n\nAgbede, who addressed newsmen over the recent kidnap attempts on motorists on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, said: \u201cWe, the Senior Elders of YCE, have been crying to our governors because they were the ones who invited security experts. Since they have been doing things to check the menace of insecurity which has now become a nuisance, they should it with all their hearts.\n\n\u201cThe establishment of Amotekun is a laudable project which all of us in the South West had embraced. The issue of security of lives and property is not only for us in the Yoruba Nation, it\u2019s for everybody who is resident in that zone irrespective of where you come from whether you are a Nigerian or you are from overseas.\n\n\u201cKidnappers don\u2019t look at people\u2019s faces, what they want is money and there is a new dimension to it now. Our people now have been engaging in criminal acts. It is no longer the Fulani business; it has been embraced by all and sundry across all the regions.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming from Lagos on Saturday, I saw some kidnappers with my own eyes just about 15 kilometers after Ogere. They were in combat dress, they were more than eight in number. They had their G-helmet and even bulletproof vests and AK-47. They emerged from the bush; the only luck I had was that they were on the opposite side of the road.\n\n\u201cSo our governors have to do more than just focussing on politics because their attention is on the 2023 elections and if they are not careful, the 2023 elections may be a mirage. If this insecurity is not frontally addressed, the 2023 elections may not hold.\u201d\n\nHunters hold security meetings to curb bandits\n\nMeanwhile, the National President of Soludero Hunters Association, Oba Nureni Anabi, said the security meeting is fixed for February 4, 2022, at Ilaji Farms Hotel, Ibadan.\n\nAjijola, who urged Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to empower the hunters, said if they are properly mobilized, the bandits who inflict indescribable suffering on the people in the zone, will disappear.\n\nThe hunters said a former President of the country, Olusegun Obasanjo, Governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Rotimi Akeredolu of Ekiti, Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos and royal fathers in the zone are expected at the all-important meeting.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A staff of the National Assembly recently collapsed and died while ascending the second floor of the White House through the staircase.\n\nThe spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State, Chika Nwoba also slumped in court.\n\nThe Chairman of Akwanga Local Government Council in Nasarawa State Hon Emmanuel Leweh recently slumped in his office at the council Secretariat, Akwanga.\n\nLast year, an Airport staffer at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja also slumped and died on duty in the Abuja radar control room.\n\nHere are a few tips to adhere to which can help one to avoid slump:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n1. Improve your sleeping pattern/hours of rest\n\nSleeping is just as important as regular exercise and a healthy diet.\n\nResearch shows that poor sleep has immediate negative effects on your hormones, exercise performance, and brain function\n\nFor many, sleep quality and quantity has declined. In fact, many people regularly get poor sleep.\n\n2. Regular health checkups\n\nRegular check-ups can help find potential health issues before they become a problem.\n\nWhen you see your doctor regularly, they are able to detect health conditions or diseases early. Early detection gives you the best chance for getting the right treatment quickly, avoiding any complications.\n\nBy getting the correct health services, screenings, and treatment you are taking important steps toward living a longer, healthier life.\n\n3. Good diet\n\nEating healthy food is important as it helps to avoid having heart diseases or even suffering kidney failure.\n\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been scientifically proven to provide numerous health benefits, such as reducing your risk of several chronic diseases and keeping your body healthy.\n\nEating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health, and can help you feel your best.\n\nThis means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain healthy body weight.\n\nAmong lots of other health benefits, eating a balanced breakfast can help sync up your biological clock by letting your body know that it\u2019s time to wake up and get going.\n\n4. Regular water\n\nStaying hydrated is one of the simplest ways to keep energized and focused.\n\nThe body constantly loses water throughout the day, mostly through urine and sweat but also from regular body functions like breathing. To prevent dehydration, you need to get plenty of water and food every day.\n\n5. Always check your blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac arrest or heart issues.\n\nHigh blood pressure (also called hypertension) happens when your blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than normal.\n\nMany people have high blood pressure without even being aware. Most people who have high blood pressure do not have symptoms. This is why it\u2019s sometimes called \u201cthe silent killer.\u201d It is very important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.\n\n6. Reduce alcohol intake\n\nQuitting alcohol isn\u2019t easy but the reduction is very important.\n\nAccording to statistics, Alcohol consumption contributes to 3 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, the harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 5.1% of the global burden of disease.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Jide Orintunsin and Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nState helmsmen to shortlist two aspirants for chair\n\nZoning battle rages\n\nConvention guidelines out\n\nGovernors are holding tight to their influence in the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAs the ruling party gets set for its convention on February 26, the governors have resolved to screen the chairmanship aspirants and recommend two preferred choices for President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval, it was learnt last night.\n\nThere are 11 aspirants for the office of chairman, all of them from the North.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe party said yesterday it has not decided on the zoning of offices.\n\nThose who have expressed interest to lead the party are Alhaji Tanko Almakura, Alhaji Saliu Mustapha, Senator Sani Musa, Senator Modu Sheriff, Senator George Akume, Senator Danjuma Goje, Sunny Sylvester Monidafe, Mohammed Estu, Isa Yuguda, Sani Shinkafi and Abdulaziz Yari.\n\nNone of them is prepared to step down.\n\nAs the battle of zoning rages on, Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello is lobbying to prevent zoning of the party chair to Northcentral where he comes from so as not to jeopardise his bid for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nThe APC governors, who pushed for the sack of the Adams Oshiomohole exco, also at the weekend overruled the plan by some members of the caretaker committee to shift the convention beyond next month.\n\n\u201cGovernors have resolved to propose two aspirants to the President. Anyone he picks will be supported to become the chairman,\u201d a source said.\n\nBuhari, who is the party\u2019s leader, is expected to pick any of the two shortlisted aspirants as the next national chairman.\n\nMost of the aspirants are now besieging the governors, while some of them were jittery about zoning.\n\nThey were said to be mounting pressure on the governors and members of the kitchen cabinet of the President to ask Buhari to leave the chairmanship open.\n\nBut the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) caucus appeared to be having the upper hand in seeking the concession of the chairmanship to it.\n\nSources said APC governors agreed to recommend two aspirants to the President to avoid rancour.\n\nA governor, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cWe are working towards a crisis-free national convention, especially the choice of our next national chairman.\n\n\u201cAlthough our party leader, President Buhari, is saying that he has no interest in any aspirant, we know his body language says otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that security agencies are presently profiling all the aspirants at the instance of the presidency.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we have decided to assist the President and the party by limiting the choices of chairmanship aspirants to two at the national convention.\n\n\u201cWe are already consulting among ourselves on the two aspirants to recommend to the President, party leaders and other stakeholders to pick one from the list.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the ultimate decision rests with the President, who is our leader. In the end, it will be the lot of President Buhari to build consensus in the party on the preferred aspirant.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, a Northern governor and some aspirants have been lobbying against zoning of the office of the national chairman.\n\nAnother source said: \u201cThis governor, who has presidential ambition, is working in alliance with some aspirants to prevail on party leaders and CECPC members to leave the office open to all the six geopolitical zones in the country.\n\n\u201cThe governors are, however, determined to push ahead with their unity agenda to shortlist two aspirants.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that if the CPC gets the chairmanship seat, it might be a straightforward battle between Tanko Al-Makura and Mustapha, who is a former Deputy National Chairman of CPC.\n\nAl-Makura and Mustapha played key roles in the merger talks in 2014.\n\nYesterday, the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) released the guidelines for the February 26 convention.\n\nAlso, the ruling party said the report of the Reconciliation Committee headed by Senator Abdullahi Adamu would be ready on January 31.\n\nAccording to the caretaker committee, the sale of forms for party offices will commence on February 14.\n\nBut, the CECPC clarified that party offices have not been zoned, contrary to reports in some quarters.\n\nAlso, Senate Chief Whip Orji Kalu, who had earlier called for the postponement of the convention, retraced his steps, saying that the guidelines were in order.\n\nAt its 19th regular meeting, which lasted for two days, the caretaker committee released the timetable and schedule of activities for the convention.\n\nIts secretary Senator John James Akpanudoedehe told reporters that zoning was not on the agenda of the meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m here to debunk the fake news going around on the social media that we have zoned offices. We are yet to meet on the issue of zoning.\n\n\u201cThe news and rumour making round are fake. We never discussed the issue during our deliberations. People should disregard the story because it is fake news. It is not true.\u201d\n\nAccording to the timetable, the caretaker committee will receive the interim report of the National Reconciliation Committee on January 31. It will consider and adopt reports of state congresses on February 2.\n\nThe schedule of activities signed by the Secretary also showed that the inauguration of the state executives will take place on February 3.\n\nSale of forms to aspirants for national offices is slated for February 14 at the party National Secretariat while submission of completed forms will take place on or before February 19, 2022\n\nThe caretaker committee also fixed the publication of sub-committees for February 19 and screening of aspirants between February 20 and 22.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the Screening Appeal Committee will hear and resolve complaints on February 23 while the accreditation of statutory and elected delegates to the National Convention will take place between February 24 and 25. The National Convention will hold on February 26.\n\nThe secretary said the hearing of complaints arising from the National Convention will be conducted on February 28.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Senate, Kalu said he looked forward to a peaceful convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am expecting a very good Convention and very good atmosphere. We are going to make Nigerians proud after the convention.\u201d\n\nOn his visit to President Muhammadu Buhari last night, Kalu said his mission was not about his rumoured presidential ambition.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is not the first time I go to see the President. The presidency is a place where people go in the afternoon, I went in the night to avoid the media.\n\n\u201cI go there regularly. It is a family affair and I went there to discuss national issues, issues of security, the issue of well being of our country and the issue of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe discussion was very fruitful and it was held in the night. Is that why you should come to ambush me?\u201d\n\nOn whether he has informed the President of his desire to contest the presidential ticket of the APC, Kalu said: \u201cDid the party zone the 2023 presidency to the Southwest? I told you before that when the party zones it officially to the South, I will declare my interest.\n\n\u201cI told you the only two zones that have not tasted the presidency are the Southeast and the Northeast.\n\n\u201cOnce they zone it to anyone of them, I have the capacity and the capability; I will roll and I will rock like a hurricane.\u201d\n\nOn why he should wait for APC to zone the ticket to the Southeast, Kalu said: \u201cA serious-minded person will like to be fair to Nigeria, fair to the society and to be fair to the atmosphere because the party is not owned by me or you the media.\n\n\u201cThis party is owned by Nigerians and the APC members. It is only APC that can decide, like at the forthcoming convention, where the Presidential ticket will be zoned to.\u201d\n\nHe said that he does not believe in Igbo presidency, but a President of Igbo extraction.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cI believe in Nigerian President of Igbo extraction,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the agitation for power shift to the Southeast, he said: \u201cIt is overdue. I believe that we should produce the next President and it is going to happen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to push; I have to push along with the other regions.\u201d",

Nnamdi Kanu) pursuant to his unlawful expulsion from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn order mandating and compelling the Nigerian government to forthwith release Nnamdi Kanu from detention and to restore him to his liberty, same being his state of being as of 19th June, 2021 and to thereupon repatriate him to Britain, his country of domicile and citizenship.An order mandating and compelling the Nigerian government to issue an official letter of apology to Nnamdi Kanu for the infringement of his fundamental rights, and publication of said letter of apology in three national dailies.\u201d\n\nAfter the suit was heard and concluded on December 10 last year, Justice Anya fixed yesterday for judgment. In a judgment that lasted for an hour, the judge said his court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate in the applicant\u2019s reliefs Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6. Justice Anya said the court was not vested with the powers to adjudicate on matters that took place in a foreign land, far away outside its jurisdiction.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOn the applicant\u2019s prayer for the court to order his release from detention and repatriate him back to Britain, his country of domicile before his arrest, the judge held that the court also lacked the jurisdiction to entertain matters relating to extradition.\n\nTurning to relief No.1, Justice Anya said it was wrong for the military to have invaded Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s home in Afaraukwu, which made him to flee the country, saying by so doing, his fundamental human rights were seriously violated.\n\nWhile saying that brutality, torture, abductions and other forms of killings do not resolve conflicts, rather they fertilise it, Justice Anya advised the Federal Government to apply political solution to the Kanu problem.\n\nThe court, therefore, ordered the Federal Government to apologise to Nnamdi Kanu for infringing on his human rights and awarded N1billion as exemplary damages.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the judgment, Ejimakor said: \u201cWith the Umuahia judgment, the bench warrant issued in Abuja may have to be vacated. That he is in detention today was because they said he jumped bail, but with the court\u2019s ruling, that issue will be put to rest.\u201d\n\nEjimakor said he may approach another court, or the Appeal Court, in respect of the rendition matter which the Abia High Court declined jurisdiction.",

          "title": "Upstream Commission Rakes in N175bn from Sale of Marginal Fields",
          "text": "\u202231 oil assets fully paid for as litigations stall two\n\n\u2022Targets N3.38trn in revenues in 2022\n\n\u2022Laments 115,000bpd loss to oil theft, technical deficiencies\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Petroleum Commission (NURPC) yesterday disclosed that the 2020 marginal field bid round which was concluded last year so far has yielded about N174.944 billion, with owners of 30 fields having partially paid and two fields stalled by court cases.\n\nThe new commission further stated that 20 companies which won the bids had partially paid up, among those who won the 57 oilfields.\n\nIn May 2021, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) which transmuted into NURPC with the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), concluded the 2020 marginal oilfield bid round, the first successful exercise since 2003, when 24 assets were put on offer.\n\nThe process which culminated in the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja, by the industry regulator, started in June 2020, with 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore put up for lease by the federal government.\n\nMarginal fields are smaller oil blocks typically developed by indigenous companies and have remained unproduced for a period of over 10 years.\n\nSome of the companies which emerged winners at the time included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.\n\nA few others that succeeded in crossing the hurdle and had fully satisfied all conditions were: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil, Virgin Forest among others.\n\nAt the time, it was also a big win for local oil and gas companies in the country, which had a good outing during the ceremony as 100 per cent of the beneficiaries of the exercise were indigenous entities.\n\nNigeria last conducted marginal field bid rounds in 2003, with 16 of the fields contributing just two per cent to the national oil and gas reserves.\n\nThe commission also stated that its target revenue for 2022 remained N3.38 trillion, substantially exceeding its 2021 revenue projection of N3 trillion and that of 2020 which was pegged at N1.746 trillion.\n\nIn a presentation it made to the Senate Committee on Petroleum, Upstream, led by Senator Bassey Akpan, during an oversight meeting at its headquarters in Abuja, the commission led by Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, explained that it hit N1.99 trillion revenue in 2020, surpassing its forecast of N1.746 trillion by about 13.98 per cent.\n\nBut in 2021, with a revenue target of N3.066 trillion, the commission which was then known as DPR pointed out that it generated N2.711 trillion, achieving 88.45 per cent of its revenue forecast which is usually paid into the federal government coffers.\n\nIt stated that in spite of the reduced fiscal provision in the PIA, the commission was set to achieve its desired revenue target for 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the commission lamented that with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quota of 1.683 million bpd in January and 1.701 million bpd in February, it is only able to pump 1.396 million bpd currently, leading to a loss of at least 115,926 million bpd on a daily basis, put at roughly $300 million monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are losing about 115, 926 barrels per day, so that literally translates to roughly about $300 million and that\u2019s a huge loss to a nation that actually requires these funds,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chief executive, Komolafe, attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\n\n\u201cBut the larger percentage is due to crude oil theft and as a commission we know the impact of this and recognising our regulatory role, we have been able to reach out to other operators as to what we can do about this.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to put in place an industry-wide initiative to ameliorate the situation and we are expecting to go live in terms of implementation in collaboration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and the other stakeholders,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he stated that despite the encumbrances, it would continue to promote an enabling environment for investment in the upstream petroleum sector, establish, monitor and regulate as well as enforce environmental measures and optimise government\u2019s take from the country\u2019s hydrocarbon resources.\n\nIn addition, the commission vowed to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of leases and licences granted, enforce all laws relating to upstream operations as well as maintain a petroleum industry data bank.\n\nKomolafe, responding to issues raised by the senators on the environmental degradation in the Niger Delta, stated that there are provisions in the PIA which provide for remediation.\n\nHe stated that the commission recognises that the job was enormous and had set up an internal committee to liaise with the senate steering committee to work on regulations for the industry.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chief executive stated that if fully implemented, the PIA would take care of issues connected with the environment, adding that while some pollutions are attributable to normal oil operations, others could be credited to sabotage by other parties.\n\nIn other issues, the commission revealed that it expects its new office to be completed in January 2023, while the total handing over will be done in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nIn his comments, leader of the senate delegation, Akpan, along with his deputy, Ifeanyi Uba, and other members of the team, who spoke, urged the commission to expedite action on regulations concerning the community trust fund.\n\nIn addition, the senators urged the upstream commission to deploy technology in taming oil theft as well as work towards reducing the cost of production per barrel of crude oil.\n\nAkpan vowed that the committee will continue to put all stakeholders on their toes, including the commission, explaining that by now the commission should have finished with preparing some regulations in line with the timelines provided by the PIA. \u201cAs a regulator, you should have timelines,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe senate committee, upstream, explained that the PIA remains work in progress, stating that all grey areas in the law will be ironed out in the next set of amendments.\n\nThe committee urged Komolafe to relate closely with it if there is any pressure from any quarters, stating that the Minister of State , Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, had told it that the agencies were given a free hand to operate.\n\n\u201cWe are going to put you on your toes. Nobody will pity you. We will come here even twice a month. So, let us know what you are doing because this is a very serious mandate given to you by Mr President,\u201d Akpan noted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Commend senate for okaying direct, indirect, consensus modes of primaries\n\n\u2022To engage NLC, TUC over proposed increase in fuel price\n\n\u2022Hold secret parley with EFCC boss over security votes\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Sunday Aborisade and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), met late last night, over National Assembly\u2019s recommitment to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, and challenged the House of Representatives, to concur with the specific amendments of the Senate, in order to make the job of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), a lot easier ahead of the next set of elections.\n\nThe governors, who commended the Senate for the quick passage of the bill and allowing different options as modes of primary elections, which they reckoned would enable INEC prepare on time for the forthcoming elections, also announced plans to engage with the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) over the proposed increase in the price of fuel.\n\nAt the same time, the governors, whose meeting lasted till the early hours of this morning, secretly held a crucial meeting with the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, and some officials of the EFCC, over the management of security votes by the governors.\n\nChairman of the governors\u2019 forum and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who briefed the press at exactly 12:50am today, said the senators were statesmen by their decision and therefore wanted the House to concur with the position of the Senate for the ease of INEC\u2019s job\n\nFayemi hinted that the governors discussed among others, the planned increase in the price of fuel, explained that they would engage the NLC and the TUC on how to address the implications of the planned fuel increase and resolve the matter peacefully.\n\nOutcome of their discussions on the planned fuel increase to between N300 to N350 per litre would be tabled during today\u2019s National Economic Council (NEC) to be chaired by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nThe Ekiti governor also said the governors deliberated the omicron variant of covid-19 and how to reduce the effect as well as seeking more funding for the states.\n\nAccording to him, the governors had received briefings from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others that would aid the states.\n\nThe NGF chairman, who said they received briefings on the ease of doing business in the states, also confirmed their meeting with the chairman of EFCC over what he described as normal discussions.\n\nBut the meeting, which held at the instance of the NGF, was deemed crucial and sensitive by the governors, so much that they sent out all their support staff at the NGF secretariat before it commenced.\n\nThe EFCC team, led by its chairman, THISDAY gathered, considered the issue of security votes and how some governors withdrew huge sum of money in the name of security votes for their respective states without accountability\n\nApart from Fayemi, others at the meeting were the Governors of Anambra, Willie Obiano; Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje; Nasarawa, Abdullai Sule; Osun, Gboyega Oyetola and Oyo, Seyi Makinde.\n\nAlso in attendance were 10 deputy governors and the World Bank representative.\n\nHead, Media and Public Affairs at the NGF Secretariat, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, had in a statement at the weekend said the meeting was at the instance of Fayemi, \u201cwhere pressing national concerns will be discussed.\n\n\u201cTo also feature prominently are the interventions programmes like the regular updates from the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum SFTAS team and another on CARES, as well as a few presentations. The Governors are expected to address a press conference at the end of the meeting,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nThe National Assembly had moved expeditiously, yesterday, following its resumption from the Christmas break on Tuesday and kept its promise to immediately revisit the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, 2021, which President Muhammadu Buhari declined to assent to, last month.\n\nAnd in keeping faith with the mood of the nation, the National Assembly, yesterday, re-amended the proposed legislation that was passed by both chambers on November 18, 2021.\n\nWhile both the Senate and the House re-amended Clause 84(2)and expunged the contentious imposition of compulsory direct primaries on parties as procedure for nomination of candidates to stand elections, they differed on the inclusion of consensus option.\n\nThe Senate, on its part, loosened the process and procedure to include direct, indirect and consensus options, the House of Representatives, which also amended Clause 84(2) in the bill only approved direct and indirect primaries as procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions.\n\nWith these, the option of consensus candidate, which both chambers had a differing opinion on, meant a conference committee would now be set up to harmonise both positions.\n\nAlready, some civil society organisations (CSOs) have rejected the consensus option introduced by the Senate in the amended Electoral Bill.\n\nIn a joint statement, the CSOs which included Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), CISLAC, Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), Albino Foundation CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS) Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF), among others, said the Consensus mode was antithetical to democratic principles and wouldresult in the subversion of popular will.\n\nChairman, Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Kabiru Gaya, told journalists after plenary that the bill would be transmitted to the president next week.\n\nGaya said, \u201cWe expect the conference committee to meet this week. We will expect their report at plenary next Tuesday. The National Assembly will transmit the clean copy to the President before the end of next week.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Senate also approved the recommended Clause 84(3) that, \u201ca political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below: (a) In the case of Presidential Primaries, all registered members of the party are to vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the federation.\u201d\n\nIt provides further that, \u201csimilar procedure as in (a) above, shall be adopted for Gubernatorial, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies.\u201d\n\nThe Senate added that, \u201cSpecial Conventions should be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centers at the National, State, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies.\u201d\n\nClause 84(4) further provides that, \u201ca political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below; (a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, a political party shall, (i) hold special presidential convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the Federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party.\u201d\n\nIt provides further in sub-paragraph two (ii) that, \u201cthe aspirant with the highest number of votes at the end of voting, shall be declared the winner of the Presidential primaries of the political party and the aspirant name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nThe amendment followed a motion for its re-committal to the Committee of the Whole. The motion was sponsored by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nIn his presentation, the Senate Leader, recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari, had signified withholding his assent on the Electoral Act No. 6 2010 (Repeal and Re-enactment) Bill, 2021.\n\nSenator Abdullahi noted that the rationale for withholding assent bordered on his observation in Clause 84.\n\nPresident Buhari in the letter dated December 13, 2021, and address to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, had explained that his decision to withhold assent to the electoral bill was informed by advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government after a thorough review.\n\nAccording to the president, signing the bill into law would have serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences on the country, particularly, in view of Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nSenator Abdullahi, however, explained that the motion for re-committal of the bill to the Committee on the Whole was against the backdrop of the, \u201cneed to address the observation by Mr. President C-in-C and make necessary amendment in accordance with Order 87(c) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 (as amended); and relying on order 1(b) and 52(6) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 ( as amended).\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the chamber rescinded its decision on the affected Clause of the Bill as passed and recommit same to the Committee of the Whole for consideration and passage.\n\nSpeaking after the bill had been passed, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, pledged that the red chamber would work with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to achieve free, fair and credible elections.\n\nLawan, therefore, urged the electoral umpire to take advantage of the proposed legislation, when assented to, and give Nigerians, an election that they would be proud of.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is one bill that Nigerians particularly, are so interested in because it is one sure way of enhancing our electoral processes and producing leaders at various levels of governance. What we have done today is to respond to the observation of Mr. President and because of our constituents and other stakeholders on the need for us to expedite action on addressing those observations made by Mr. President and we have done that vert patriotically.\n\n\u201cToday, as the bill stands, there is provision for all possible options for selection of candidates from presidency to the councillorship. The available options we have are: the direct primaries, indirect primaries, and consensus candidature. What this means is that political parties are now, once this becomes law, challenged to ensure that they choose what is appropriate, what is suitable for them, when it comes to the processes of producing their candidates.\n\n\u201cI will urge that we should practice all these three so that we are able to develop them. Because there is advantage in each just as there could be disadvantage in all of them. Ours is to ensure proper and appropriate application of these models, if we don\u2019t, as practicing politicians, if the parties don\u2019t, and try to go round the circles and maybe cutting corners, these processes will continue to be disadvantaged at all times.\n\n\u201cWith this, we also hope that INEC will take advantage of all the available amendments, including what they suggested to the committees, will be amendments that will enhance their activities, performance. We are very optimistic that once the clean copy of this bill is sent to the president, he will assent to the bill and that will mark a very important moment for the politics, democracy in this country.\n\n\u201cWe will still be around to ensure that INEC receives every possible support from the national assembly for INEC to conduct the 2023 elections successfully, transparently and with the integrity that Nigerians will all be proud of when it comes to either off-season elections or the general election in 2023. Laws alone will not be enough. We may have the best laws, if we don\u2019t operate them properly, they may not mean much. I urge practitioners, politicians and INEC to ensure that we obey and operate the laws as provided in the electoral act.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the House of Representatives didn\u2019t include the consensus option as adopted by the Senate.\n\nThe amendments followed a substantive motion of recommittal and reconsideration moved by the Chairman, House Committee on Rules and Business, Hon. Hassan Fulata.\n\nBefore suspending its rules to work on the bill, the lawmakers went into a closed-door session. Proceedings were stalled for about 15 minutes, as the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, shortly after reading a letter from President Buhari, seeking passage of three bills, was seen discussing in hushed tones with his Deputy, Hon. Idris Wase, and some other lawmakers.\n\nAs the discussion stretched, the Speaker called on the Majority Leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa to move that the House goes into executive session.\n\nReconvening about 25 minutes later, the lawmakers were seen bickering over what might not be unconnected to the issue.\n\nAfter calm was restored by the presiding officer, he called on Hon. Fulata to move the motion for amendments on the Bill.\n\nMoving the motion, Fulata recalled that the National Assembly amended Section 87(2) of the Electoral Act, 2010 as Clause 84(2) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to read thus: \u201cThe procedure for nomination of Candidates by Political Parties for various elective positions shall be by direct primaries\u201d.\n\nHe, therefore, said cognisant of the need to allow political parties choose the procedure for nomination of candidates for elective positions, the House would commit Section 84(2) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to the Committee of the Whole for reconsideration in accordance with Order 12, Rule 20 (1-3) of the Standing Orders of the House.\n\nDissolving into the Committee of the Whole for reconsideration, Gbajabiamila put to a voice vote, the clause 84(2), which now read thus: \u201cThat a political party seeking to nominate candidates for election under this Act shall hold primaries for aspirants to all elective positions. The procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct or indirect primaries,\u201d and the amendments were adopted by majority of the lawmakers.\n\nHowever, raising a point of order, Hon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante Dagomie (PDP, Rivers),said there were errors in other clauses in the bill, which was sent back to them, hence, the lawmakers should take their time to look at these clauses one after the other so that members could make inputs.\n\nMaking reference to one of the clauses, He said, \u201cIn the case of nomination of presidential candidate, a political party shall hold special convention in each of the 36 states of the federation and FCT, where delegates shall vote for each of the aspirants at the designated centers on specified dates.\n\n\u201cIf you go further a National convention shall be held for the ratification, so you don\u2019t elect at the convention. The election of the Presidential candidate will remain at the various state level.\u201d\n\nResponding, Gbajabiamila said, \u201cAs a seasoned legislator, I have read the rules of the House to you and you know that we are confined to the observation made by Mr. President; we have a near perfect document.\u201d\n\nBriefing journalists shortly after plenary, the House Spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, reacting to a question on why the House didn\u2019t include the consensus option like the Senate, said the president in his official letter to the House never mentioned consensus option, rather,he specifically said the mode of nomination should be direct or indirect.\n\nHe explained that there was no accommodation in the House rules, which allowed such, adding that they could not import what was not in the President\u2019s letter.\n\nOn the lawmakers rescinding from their earlier decision to override the president, he explained that while the constitution empowered the parliament to override the President\u2019s veto, it could only be done if they had two-thirds majority vote.\n\nPDP Commends National Assembly\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has commended the leadership of the National Assembly for listening to the views of Nigerians by removing the controversial clause of direct primary elections by political parties and changing it with indirect primary and consensus options.\n\nThe party, therefore, called on the two chambers of the National Assembly to ensure that the amended version of the electoral bill got to President Muhammadu Buhari within the next 48 hours\n\nIt also called on the president to assent to the bill within the next 72 hours and not wait for another 30 days before assenting the bill into law.\n\nThis, the PDP said, was to enable INEC commence preparations for the 2023 general election.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY on the passage and removal of the controversial direct primary clause from the electoral bill, the National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said with the quick amendments of the bill to reflect the views of the Nigerian electorate, \u201cthey have put self behind the aspirations of Nigerians that political parties should be allowed to determine how the parties manage their internal affairs\n\n\u201cThey have affirmed that there should be as in the constitution, the freedom to associate and speak freely as Nigerians. This is what the constitution that we practice and operate as our grundnorm posits,\u201d he added.\n\nCSOs Reject Senate\u2019s Consensus Option\n\nIn a joint statement, the CSOs called on the Senate to, in line with the popular will of Nigerians, adopt the position of the House of Representatives, which now recognises direct and indirect primaries as procedure for nomination of candidates.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cAt today\u2019s plenary, the Senate and House of Representatives recommitted the Electoral Bill 2021, with proposed amendment to Clause 84 dealing with nomination of candidates. We reject the decision of the Senate to introduce a completely new mode of \u2018consensus\u2019 as a procedure for candidates\u2019 nomination.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it violates the rights of aspirants to equal participation in party primaries and limits the choice of voters to candidates, who did not emerge from democratic primary elections. Judging from experience, consensus has occasioned a litany of litigations in Nigeria\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Senate to, in line with the popular will of Nigerians, adopt the position of the House of Representatives, which now recognises direct and indirect primaries as procedure for nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cWith this development, a harmonisation committee will now have to be constituted by the leadership of the National Assembly to harmonise the divergent positions of both chambers, thereby delaying the speedy conclusion of the process.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call for the immediate withdrawal of this new introduction, which is alien to the original Electoral Bill 2021, to speed up the work of the harmonisation committee and conclusion of the amendment process on or before the 21 January 2022 deadline. As indicated in our earlier statement, any further delay will undermine public confidence in the reform process and therefore, unacceptable.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Releases convention timetable, beefs up security at secretariat\n\n\u2022Chieftain condemns alleged zoning of chairmanship to N\u2019west as Shinkafi joins race\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\nThe leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has denied reports that it had zoned some party positions ahead of its national convention slated for February 26.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, who described the report in some sections of the media (not THISDAY) as untrue, said the committee has yet to take a position on zoning.\n\nBut the party leadership has, however, released the convention timetable and programme of activities, even as it has beefed up security around the party\u2019s secretariat.\n\nIn the same breath, the immediate past National Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Dr. Sani Shinkafi, has also joined the APC chairmanship race of the party.\n\nHowever, the secretary, while giving an update on the state of the party, said, \u201cWe are also here to rebuff the fake news going round the social media that we have zoned party offices; we are yet to meet on the issue of zoning.\u201d\n\nThe Caretaker Committee at its 19th regular meeting yesterday considered and adopted the timetable/schedule of activities for the convention.\n\nThe party said sales of forms to all aspirants vying for national offices would commence on February 14th, while submission of completed forms and accompanying documents at party secretariat was slated on or before February 19.\n\nThe APC scheduled the publication of sub-committees for February 19th, while screening of all aspirants vying for national offices would take place between February 20th and 22nd.\n\nAlso, the party said the sitting of appeal panels to hear and resolve complaints arising from the screening exercise has been slated for February 23, while accreditation of all statutory and elected delegates to the National Convention was scheduled for February 24th and 25th.\n\nIt concluded that the national convention to elect national officers to the National Executive Committee (NEC) would take place on the 26th, while the National Convention Appeal was scheduled for February 28.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the APC leadership has beefed up security at the party secretariat in Abuja as the meeting of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (APC) entered the second day.\n\nThe Caretaker committee could not reach a logical conclusion on the venue, and modalities of the convention of the party slated for February 26. The increased security presence at party\u2019s headquarters might not be unconnected to the continued power play that forced the committee to fix February 26 for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nMen of the Nigerian Police Fire were stationed at strategic locations along the Blantyre Street of the secretariat.\n\nA party source hinted that the increase security presence was more like a routine exercise, adding that most times, the party also took action based on intels, and that there would be several meetings on the composition of sub-committees for the national convention, hence the need to ensure safety of everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, member of the party from Bayelsa State, Mr. Ambrosini Sambo, has described the alleged zoning of the APC chairmanship to the North West as a plot to destroy the party.\n\nSambo, who spoke with journalists yesterday in Abuja, said there were plans to impose a chairman on the party through the rumoured zoning to the North-west.\n\n\u201cThis spells doom for the party. The decision to impose this candidate from the North-West on the party as the chairman will destabilise the party. Every well-meaning party member should not support this.\n\n\u201cThis is the plan of the enemies APC to destroy the party which we fought so hard to build, we will resist this move. The party Chairman is open to other zones to contest,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in what he described as injustice to the party before it would be too late.\n\nOn his party, Shinkafi, who just joined the APC chairmanship race, is believed to being sponsored by the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle.\n\nHe, however, said the state was not ready to lose the slot considering the fact that a former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, who had indicated interest to contest for the position was technically not a member of the ruling party at the moment.\n\nHe insisted that during the recent revalidation and registration exercise conducted in the state, Yari and some other party stakeholders in the state refused to participate.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirant argued that contrary to perception, he was not in the race to whittle down the influence and chances of Yari, but explained that Yari\u2019s decision to boycott the revalidation and registeration exercise has already disqualified him from the race.\n\n\u201cTo me Abdulaziz Yari knows who I am. He\u2019s one of my best friends in those days before he became governor and turned himself into a mini-god. Before me and Matawalle became friends, I have been friends with Yari.\n\n\u201cAs far as the national record of APC is concerned, in my text of press briefing, I have made more emphasis on the credible and verifiable membership register. I challenge you and I challenge everyone here to go and meet Abdulazeez Yari and ask him, let him show you his authentic and revalidated membership card as a card carrying member of APC.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, he is already automatically disqualified from this race and based on that I don\u2019t want our state to take risk of not participating, or not taking slot in our great party and I have decided to join the race. You can go and verify from his ward, his name is not on the register and he doesn\u2019t have authentic membership card,\u201d Shinkafi stated.\n\nHe said if and when elected as national chairman of the party, he would reposition and reorganise the party based on its philosophy of social democracy, which basically meant people-oriented, membership mobilisation and recruitment and mass based political organisation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia\n\nAn Abia State high court in Umuahia Wednesday ordered the Federal Government and the Army high command to pay a sum of N1 billiin compensation to the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over the invasion of his home in 2017.\n\nJustice Benson Anya gave the order in the judgement he delivered in the suit filed by Kanu against the Federal Government, Attorney General of the Federation, Chief of Army Staff(COAS)and five other respondents.\n\nThe court also ordered the Federal Government to issue a written apology to the IPOB leader for violating his fundamental human rights and destroying his home during the military operation code named Python Dance II.\n\nHowever the Court declined jurisdiction over the issue of the abduction and extradition of the IPOB leader from Kenya, saying that such powers resides with the federal high court.\n\nKanu had in August 2021 filed the suit through his special counsel, Mr. Aloy Ejimakor, challenging his \u201crendition from Kenya, unlawful detention and subsequent trial by the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nHe had asked the court to grant him eight relief, including \u201ca declaration that the military invasion of the Applicant\u2019s building and premises at Isiama, Afaraukwu Ibeku, Abia State on 10th September, 2017 by the respondents or their agents is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amount to infringement of the applicant\u2019s fundamental right to life, dignity of his person, his personal liberty and fair hearing\u201d as guaranteed under the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe separatist leader also asked the court to make \u201can order mandating and compelling the respondents to pay the sum of N5 billion to the applicant\u201d as damages.\n\nBut Justice Anya said that in awarding N1billon to the applicant, the Court took cognisant of the \u201cexamplary and compensatory damages\u201d done to the applicant by the respondents.\n\nHe held that the military invasion of Kanu\u2019s home in September 2017 was \u201cunlawful and a violation of his fundamental human rights\u201d hence \u201cthe applicant deserves an apology\u201d as well as compensation from the Federal Government.\n\nAnya faulted the claims by the federal authorities and its security agencies that they did not invade the IPOB leader\u2019s home, describing the denial as \u201cflimsy and ineffectual\u201d as the military operation was notorious and could not escape judicial notice.\n\nHe added that even the Federal Government was not responsible for the invasion of Kanu\u2019s home it should have taken steps to investigate it and punish those found culpable.\n\nThe judge stated that Nigeria being an integral part of the democratic world has a responsibility to respect the rights of its citizens, adding that Nigeria should not only borrow a leaf from democratic nations but aspire to be a shinning example for others to follow.\n\nHe warned that torture, abductions, killings, and other forms of violence \u201cdo not resolve conflicts but fertilise them\u201d.\n\nJustice Anya therefore advised the Federal Government to apply wisdom and dialogue in its handling of the case of Kanu and separatist agitations in the interest of peace, harmony and national cohesion.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the court session, Kanu\u2019s special counsel, Ejimakor said that the verdict had vindicated the IPOB leader, who was accused of jumping bail when he fled Nigeria following the invasion of his home.\n\nHe said that the court had now established that there was actual invasion by the army and threat to his life hence he could not have jumped bail by running away to save his own life which was under serious threat.\n\nCounsel to the Army, Mr. Amos Tori in his reaction to the judgment said that the army authorities would study the court verdict and respond appropriately.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said he will need to consult with relevant agencies to know the exact position of government on whether or not fuel subsidy will be stopped this year.\n\nMohammed, who spoke with newsmen after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, explained that he was going to initiate a fact-finding process to determine the state of things on the removal of petroleum subsidy following the announcement Tuesday by Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, that President Buhari had not told anyone to remove fuel subsidy.\n\nWhen asked to clarity the issue since the 2022 budget has no subsidy provision beyond June 2022, the minister said he needed to consult with the relevant government agencies to determine the exact position of the subsidy removal question.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs for the removal of fuel subsidy, I think you will give me time to consult with relevant departments and ministries and I will get back to you.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had announced that the federal government made provision for petrol subsidy only for the first six months of 2022 as the government looked towards a complete deregulation of the sector.\n\nShe had said: \u201cIn our 2022 budget, we only factored in subsidy for the first half of the year. The second half of the year, we are looking at complete deregulation of the sector, saving foreign exchange and potentially earning more from the oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nReacting to Ahmed\u2019s position after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja on Tuesday, Senate President, Lawan, told newsmen that President Buhari had not directed anyone in his government to implement the removal of petroleum subsidy.\n\nBut he also conceded that subsidy was a big burden, noting that a solution had to be found to it.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, it will be of interest to Nigerians to hear what I\u2019ve come to discuss with Mr. President among several other things.\n\n\u201cMany of us are very concerned with the recent agitations, protests and many citizens were so concerned, our constituents across the country are very concerned that the federal government will remove the petroleum subsidy. And for us, as parliamentarians, as legislators representing the people of Nigeria, this must be of interest to us.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve just finished our recess, we had gone home to our constituencies and senatorial districts. And we felt the pulse of our people. And I found it necessary to visit Mr. President, as the the leader of our government and our leader in the country, to discuss this particular issue of concern to Nigerians, and I\u2019m happy to inform Nigerians that Mr. President never told anyone that the petroleum subsidy should be removed.\n\n\u201cI know and I agree that the subsidy is very heavy. But I think we must never transfer the burden to the citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Using your mobile device or phone, simply say, \u201cHey Google, set a reminder\u201d, or \u201cHey Google, remind me to dry clean my children\u2019s uniform at noon tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGoogle Assistant will go on to set a reminder and send you a notification when it is close to the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeat the traffic with Google Maps\n\nYou can get real-time information about traffic jams and delays using Google Maps, helping to plan better routes for school runs.\n\nParents preparing to take their children to school every morning can make use of Google Maps to check for alternative routes and the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to ensure they get to school before the bell rings.\n\nComplete homework with Google Search\n\nNot all parents are subject matter experts but they do often have to play the role of designated tutor or help out with homework.\n\nIn some cases, parents have forgotten how to solve simple math problems or they may not have the answers to some basic science questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA quick search on Google can help find solutions to difficult questions.\n\nParents should however allow their children to generate the answers to their homework questions before searching Google for the answer.\n\nWatch video tutorials on YouTube\n\nYouTube is great for watching explanatory videos that are fun, informative, and educational.\n\nFor example, parents can watch videos that reveal how to solve a quadratic equation and brush up their knowledge to help their children with their homework.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also a variety of educational videos for children that can help parents tutor children who wish to learn more beyond their school work.\n\nKeep kids safe with Family Link\n\nChildren today spend more time online than ever before. As such, it is important to help them develop healthy online habits and make sure they are protected from ills such as online predators and cyberbullies.\n\nFamily Link allows parents to set digital rules to help guide their children as they learn and explore online.\n\nThe app helps children make good decisions about what they do on their devices and even shows teacher-recommended apps that can be added to their devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt can be overwhelming for parents to balance their own professional endeavours with the demands of their children\u2019s rigorous education but technology can sometimes help to lighten the load.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is not a win for the government or citizens",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is its government\u2019s most recent effort to control social media. While experts tell us that this is a failed attempt at the project, they warn that the deal will definitely have a bearing on internet freedom in the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government banned Twitter for 7 months and only lifted the ban last week after it claimed Twitter has agreed to certain terms. The social media company has, reportedly, agreed to register as a legal entity in Nigeria, pay taxes, and cooperate with Nigeria, through the Partner Support and Enforcement Portal, to regulate harmful content.\n\nTomiwa Ilori, an internet freedom researcher, says the Twitter ban sets a very bad precedent for internet freedom in the country, and if freedom of information requests and lawsuits seeking to get accurate, official, and economic explanations for the government\u2019s actions are not filed now, \u201cwe might have opened up the online right of Nigerians to express [themselves only according] to the whims of politicians.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, like in other parts of Africa, laws made by the government to regulate violent, harmful, and fake speech are used to stifle legitimate online speech.\n\nWhile explaining that he isn\u2019t aware of the exact law that the government relied on for the Twitter ban, Ilori said the Nigerian Communications Act\u2019s (NCA) long history of being weaponised to block access to internet websites makes it a prime suspect. \u201cMy guess is that they used the provisions of sections 146 and 148 of the NCA to get the telcos to block access to Twitter, as they have done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne major issue with these NCA provisions is that the government gets to decide what is in the public interest or is an emergency, as the basis of their request to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). There is no judicial review, human rights impact assessment of proposed actions before and after such requests, or public access to requests made to the internet service providers (ISPs) by the NCC. It is also important to note that ISPs do not push back or carry out necessary assessments before compliance.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban is not a win for Nigerians\n\nIlori explained that the lifting of the ban means that Nigerians need to start thinking about terms of legal reforms for online expression in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think the portal could be a great avenue for bridging sides. Having a dedicated means of reporting speech capable of causing violence and harm by proximate actors could help forestall violence. But who are these actors? I ask, because Twitter and the government should not be the only ones determining the nature and type of expression that Nigerians are allowed to share,\u201d Ilori says.\n\nIlori believes that there is a need to expand the content governance arrangement to include civil society actors, experts, and activists.\n\nThe government memo which contained the terms of lifting the ban states that the Portal would serve as a channel for law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.\n\nHowever, Ilori thinks that the government\u2019s power in the agreement is secondary and the actual moderation of content would lie with Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not a win for the government either\n\nFor Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights group, the government didn\u2019t score any points with the Portal, as it has existed for a while now; it only looks like a win for the Nigerian government because it hasn\u2019t used it before.\n\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s Transparency Report\u2014a report that gives insights into information and removal requests from around the world, by country\u2014Nigeria has made zero removal requests and just 7 information requests, at the time of reporting. However, India has made 12,435 legal removal requests, 67 court orders, and 12,368 other legal demands, representing 6% of global removal requests. According to the report, Twitter complied with 12.4% of India\u2019s requests.\n\nIn February last year, India\u2019s government enacted a fresh social media rule that made social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others more accountable to legal requests. This law allows the government to tag content as \u201cunlawful\u201d while forcing messaging service providers to identify posters of specific messages.\n\nThis regulation has its origin in the Indian government\u2019s semisweet relationship with Twitter. The government asked Twitter to take down some content it alleged was spreading misinformation about farmers protesting agricultural reform. But, to the chagrin of the Indian government, Twitter partially complied and restored access to some of the accounts it had blocked \u201cin a manner that we believe was inconsistent with Indian law,\u201d Twitter wrote at the time.\n\nThis, Sesan said, was the reason the Nigerian government has repeatedly tried to enact social media bills. But failed. First came the Frivolous Petitions Bill, which seeks to prevent the spread of falsehood on social media, with jail time and a $10,000 fine. Like subsequent remakes of the bill, it was withdrawn, after 6 months of widespread public criticism.\n\n\u201cSocial media bills\u201d as they would later be called, have been resurrected, over the years, in the form of 2 other bills: the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill.\n\nBut Sesan says Nigeria\u2019s internet restriction tactics are miles behind India\u2019s because the latter drew up regulations; Twitter will only respond to legal requests backed by legislation. \u201cIndia drew up new laws on social media that were specific. Nigeria made similar demands, but there is no bill in parliament making that case.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Ghana Plots to Become West Africa\u2019s Gas Hub in threat to Nigeria\n\nGhana\u2019s state-owned oil company is progressing with plans to sell liquefied natural gas throughout West Africa in a move that will test Nigeria\u2019s dominance and her failure to better position the country\u2019s energy credentials.\n\nAlready shipments of the fuel are beginning to flow to a specially built import terminal.\n\nGhana\u2019s Team LNG Terminal Co. is expected to start commercial operations at the plant in the second quarter of this year and can help create an energy hub for the region, Hamis Ussif, manager for gas at Ghana National Petroleum Corp. said in a Bloomberg interview in the capital, Accra. GNPC will buy the LNG from Tema and sell it onward.\n\nSome West African nations are embracing the use of natural gas as part of an effort to bring electricity to more people who live there but Nigeria with her significant gas endowments has been unable to ensure steady supply of gas around the sub region.\n\nWhile the use of fossil fuels is criticized for contributing to climate change, local producers have said that the continent only accounts for 3% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGNPC is working with partners interested in building infrastructure to sell LNG to domestic users and those within the sub-region looking to boost power, Ussif said.\n\n\u201cThe options available include a mix of pipelines, barges and trucks where feasible to reduce the cost of transporting to our neighbors.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s already been a request from Benin, a nearby nation, to increase gas supply, Ussif said.\n\nGhana has a 17-year contract for 225 million standard cubic feet a day of gas from the Tema terminal, which is backed by Helios Investment Partners and African Infrastructure Investment Managers with LNG supplied by Shell.\n\nAlso this week, Ghana permitted the nation\u2019s banks to accept overseas bonds as collateral in a bid to revive credit growth and spur economic activity in the post covid pandemic era.\n\nInvestments in offshore debt securities sold by foreign governments, companies and multilateral development banks can be used as collateral for loans, the central bank said.\n\nRead also: Cooking gas price to drop as NLNG supplies 100% LPG to domestic market\n\nThe securities must be denominated in dollar, pound, euro or yen and need to be rated AA or above, Bank of Ghana said in a statement on its website.\n\nCredit in West Africa\u2019s second-biggest economy expanded at about 6.7% in the first 10 months of 2021, the slowest pace in three years as the pandemic decimated demand.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s move may be attractive for overseas companies seeking to expand in the $68.5 billion economy, which accelerated 6.6% in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cForeign companies into manufacturing, real estate and construction may be encouraged,\u201d Benjamin Dzoboku, chief operating officer at Republic Bank said by phone, adding that it may not help local firms because they won\u2019t have such investments.\n\nIt could drive loan-growth rate by an additional 100 to 200 basis points in the coming months, he said.\n\nLenders must desist from accepting debt securities issued by their local or international affiliates, the regulator said.\n\n\u201cWith the foreign bonds you\u2019re assured of your liquidity and if you use them to secure a loan in Ghana you can nourish your business well in Ghana and still have your foreign fixed-income back,\u201d Dzoboku said.",

          "text": "Economists have said the devaluation of Nigeria\u2019s currency, naira, is inevitable in 2022 as lower oil production puts pressure on the nation\u2019s reserves.\n\nThe price of Bonny Light, Nigeria\u2019s premium oil grade, has surged to $88 per barrel, the highest since 2014, but Africa\u2019s biggest economy has missed out on an opportunity to improve its earnings as oil production falters.\n\nNigeria only produced 1.19 million bpd in December, a decline of 78,000 barrels compared with the previous month, according to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \u2013 the lowest since 2016.\n\n\u201cClearly, the FX market is constrained although we are seeing some positive development lately with higher oil prices, Nigeria may consider resetting currency and can see 10 percent depreciation from 414 to around 450-460 in 2022,\u201d Abhilash Narayan, a senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered, said during a webinar themed \u2018Global Market Outlook-Africa.\u2019\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has devalued the naira three times since March 2020, as lower oil income weakened the nation\u2019s reserves. Last year, the currency was devalued 8.6 percent to N414/$.\n\n\u201cGiven our expectations that the accretion to the FX reserves would be weak in line with the low crude oil production levels, it suggests that the ability of the CBN to defend the naira is limited to the one-off inflows from recently issued Eurobond and the IMF\u2019s SDR,\u201d analysts at Cordros Securities said.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the CBN would need the support of foreign investors to boost FX liquidity over the medium term. Overall, our baseline expectation is that the CBN will devalue the naira between N440/$ and N460/$ at the I&E Window,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a recent report advised emerging economies including Nigeria to allow their currencies to depreciate in response to tighter funding conditions and an imminent policy tightening by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.\n\nSteve Brice, the chief investment officer at Standard Chartered, said interest rates would get higher in the US, but not as high as was being speculated.\n\n\u201cWe also see interest rates going higher in countries like Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia, but Nigeria will be able to hold the line and support recovery despite weak naira,\u201d Brice said.\n\nRead also: FX inflows to Nigeria up 64% on Eurobond, IMF cash\n\nInternational credit rating agency, Fitch Solutions, has also projected that Nigeria\u2019s naira will weaken in 2022 to an average of N428/$ on weak reserves.\n\n\u201cThe naira will face various pull forces during the year. On the one hand, foreign currency borrowing and increased crude oil revenues will keep the foreign reserves above $35 billion and give the CBN some ammunition to defend the naira,\u201d according to Ikemesit Effiong, head of research, SBM Intelligence.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, increased demand from politicians mopping up dollars ahead of the elections, foreign investors seeking to repatriate their funds ahead of the elections, and manufacturers seeking to import materials will be the main demand drivers. Thus, we expect some devaluation of the official rate to about $1/N450,\u201d Effiong said.\n\nAccording to Yvonne Mhango, sub-Saharan Africa economist at Renaissance Capital, \u201cThe naira at the investor and exporters (I&E) FX window is 13 percent overvalued, on our real effective exchange rate (REER), and has a fair value of N473/$1. We see the I&E window FX rate at N482/$1 in 2022.\u201d\n\nThe bleak outlook for the naira does not stop there.\n\nAnalysts at Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) also stated that cautious naira depreciation against the US dollar would be permitted in 2022-24 to prevent major imbalances.\n\n\u201cHowever, this will be gentle compared with adjustments in 2020-21 as the current account returns to surplus and external liquidity conditions become more favourable, with a rate of N444.7:$1 expected at end-2024 (with an average rate of depreciation of 3.5% each year). Substantial devaluations are expected in 2025-26 as oil prices slide, underlining historical overvaluation,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nThe naira exchanged at N414 per dollar on Wednesday at the official market, according to data from trading platform, FMDQ.",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

He disclosed that their discussions were centred national issues with regards to security, electoral laws and the welfare of the country.\n\nHe said \u201cThis is not the first time I\u2019m going to see the President. People usually go in the afternoon but I went in the night to avoid the press.\n\n\u201cI go there regularly.It\u2019s a family affair and I went there to discuss national issues with regards to security, well being of our country and the issue of the electoral law and the discussion was very fruitful.\n\nWhen asked if he informed the President of his Presidential Ambition.\n\nHe responded \u201cHas the party zoned the ticket to the Southeast? It\u2019s only when the party zone is officially to the South. I have said before that there are only two zones that have not been President : the Southeast and the Northeast. Once it\u2019s zoned to the Southeast I have the capacity and the capability I will roll out my campaign and rock like a hurricane\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overdue for an Igboman to become a Nigerian President, I believe the Southeast should produce the next President and it\u2019s going to happen \u201d.\n\nIn a further response Kalu slammed other Presidential aspirants in his All Progressives Congress (APC) who had gone to inform President Muhammadu Buhari about their intentions saying they were not serious people.\n\nHe said those already pushing are not being fair to the feelings of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThey are not serious. A serious minded person will like to be fair to Nigeria, to be fair to the society and be fair to the atmosphere because this party is not owned by me or by you the press people. It is only APC people that can decide where the party ticket will go to,If they zone it to the Southeast I have all it takes to make a good President\u201d.\n\nThe Abia North Senator said that he would pursue his Presidential Ambition with other geopolitical zones of the Nation, while stressing that he will commence Nationwide consultation at the right time.\n\nResponding to questions on the APC\u2019s forthcoming February 26th convention Kalu expressed optimism that the exercise will be raucous free saying that the outcome will make Nigerians proud.\n\nWhen asked about President Buhari\u2019s body language to the contentious electoral act and 2023 Kalu responded saying \u201cHe\u2019s body language is where other Nigerians are . His body language is for Nigeria and Nigerians.\u201d\n\nRecall that Kalu\u2019s declaration came barely 24 hours after former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu met with President Buhari to express his interest in the top job.

But, we cannot allow people to make money while others are dying.\u201d\n\nThe governor said since the state government intensified the fight against illegal refinery operators primarily responsible for the soot, the air quality in parts of the Rivers has improved remarkably.\n\nHe said the cartel behind illicit business would make effort to compromise unscrupulous security agents in the state.\n\nThe governor, however, warned that he would personally visit the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant-General of the NSCDC and the Chief of Army Staff in Abuja, to report any of their personnel implicated in the criminality.\n\n\u201cYou know in Nigeria, we don\u2019t believe that anything can happen.

Anayo Edwin Nwonu, has promised to pursue human capital development if he is elected into office as governor in 2023.\n\nThe lawmaker who spoke to journalists in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital on Tuesday, stated that his developmental priorities would include the restoration of scholarships for Ebonyi Youths, revamping of the Education Sector, improvement in the healthcare delivery system and a full return to a functional and effective local government system in the state.\n\nOther priorities of his administration, according to him, include the restoration of the statutory rights and benefits of civil servants and local government staff, restoration of civil service ethics, conducive environment for enterpreneurship, mechanized agriculture and mass employment for Ebonyi Youths.\n\nNwonu expressed confidence that Nigeria will return to the part of progress if his party, the PDP, returns to power at the federal level in 2023, that democracy in the country would experience a major boost when the party takes over the reigns of power in Aso Rock.\n\nHe emphasized that the PDP as a political party was founded on the culture of political inclusion and national integration, which are the core elements that promote national harmony and national unity, while noting that when the party returns to power in 2023 it would take steps to stabilize the the country\u2019s economy and reduce the exchange rate of the naira in order to achieve economic recovery and massive employment for Nigerian youths\n\nHon. Nwonu noted that once the PDP Government emerges victorious in the 2023 general elections, efforts would be made to embark on national economic and Political reforms to restore the confidence of Nigerians on the Nigerian project, so as to discourage separatist agitations which undermine national security and national integration.\n\nHe commended the new leadership of PDP under Dr. Iyorchia Ayu for the brilliant steps they have taken to assure Nigerians that the party was fully ready to reclaim political leadership and reposition the socio-economic and political trajectory of the country for a brighter and more prosperous future.",

The PVC issued to all previously registered voters remains valid. This kind of statement will certainly push eligible voters to register more than once thereby creating the problem of double and multiple registrations.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the chief press secretary to the INEC chairman, Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, said that Nigerians who already have their PVCs do not need to register again.\n\nOyekanmi stressed that double registration is an offence under the electoral law.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn fact, double registration is an offence under our laws.

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nREMARKS BY THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI\n\nLAI MOHAMMED, AT THE SIGNING OF THE CULTURAL PROPERTY IMPLEMENTATION\n\nACT (CPIA) AGREEMENT BETWEEN NIGERIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nIN ABUJA ON THURSDAY, 20 JANUARY 2022\n\nPROTOCOL\n\nGood morning. It\u2019;s my pleasure to welcome you all to this important\n\nlandmark event, which is the signing of the Cultural Property\n\nImplementation Act (CPIA) between Nigeria and the United States of\n\nAmerica.\n\n2. It is no longer news that Nigerian ancient arts are greatly\n\nappreciated around the world. Ordinarily, this should be exhilarating\n\nnews to Nigerians, but it is also giving us a cause for concern,\n\nbecause the fact that the ancient arts are highly coveted encourages\n\nsponsored looting and illicit trafficking of the works by unscrupulous\n\nforeigners and Nigerians.\n\n3. Despite all efforts by the Ministry of Information and Culture\n\nand the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, with the\n\nassistance of law enforcement agencies, to prevent illicit export of\n\nthe nation\u2019s archeological and ethnological materials, widespread\n\nlooting and illicit excavation of these materials still continue. The\n\nstolen artifacts are mostly smuggled to Europe, the United States of\n\nAmerica and other places for the benefit of art collectors.\n\n4. To curb this nefarious activities, Nigeria resorted to the UNESCO\n\n1970 Convention, which enjoins Member States to the Convention, whose\n\ncultural patrimony is in jeopardy from pillage, to call upon other\n\nMember States to\n\nparticipate in concerted international measures, including the control\n\nof exports and imports and international commerce in the specific\n\nmaterials concerned.\n\n5. It is on the basis of this Convention that Nigeria and the United\n\nStates of America have agreed to leverage an American legislation, the\n\nConvention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CPIA), to prevent\n\nthe illicit import of Nigerian artifacts into the United States.\n\n6. This legislation was enacted by the United States to restrict the\n\nimportation into the US of archeological materials ranging in date\n\nfrom 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1770 as well as ethnological materials\n\nincluding those associated with royal\n\nactivity, religious activity, etc. from nations that have entered into\n\nthe kind of bilateral initiative that we are signing here with the\n\nUnited States today..\n\n7. On the basis of this agreement, Nigerian antiquities being\n\nimported into the United States without the requisite Export Permit\n\nwill be seized at the border of the United States and returned to\n\nNigeria without the arduous and costly task of going through the\n\nlabyrinth of judicial and diplomatic processes.\n\n8. We are optimistic that this agreement will reduce the pillage of\n\nour irreplaceable archeological and ethnological materials, as the\n\nmarket for these materials is being shut in the United States against\n\nillicit traffickers.\n\n9. The agreement will last for an initial period of five years. If\n\nit works well, as we anticipate it will, it shall be renewed for a\n\nlonger term. We implore other friendly nations to take a cue from the\n\nUnited States of America and join us in finding means to prevent the\n\nillegal importation of our antiquities into their countries.\n\n10. We want to most sincerely thank the Government of the United\n\nStates, in particular the Embassy of the United States in Nigeria, for\n\nmaking this possible. We look forward to a diligent implementation of\n\nthis landmark agreement, so it can become a game changer in our\n\nefforts to prevent the looting of our priceless ancient works of art.\n\n11. I thank you all for your kind attention.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nREMARKS BY THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI\n\nLAI MOHAMMED, AT THE SIGNING OF THE CULTURAL PROPERTY IMPLEMENTATION\n\nACT (CPIA) AGREEMENT BETWEEN NIGERIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nIN ABUJA ON THURSDAY, 20 JANUARY 2022\n\nPROTOCOL\n\nGood morning. It\u2019;s my pleasure to welcome you all to this important\n\nlandmark event, which is the signing of the Cultural Property\n\nImplementation Act (CPIA) between Nigeria and the United States of\n\nAmerica.\n\n2. It is no longer news that Nigerian ancient arts are greatly\n\nappreciated around the world. Ordinarily, this should be exhilarating\n\nnews to Nigerians, but it is also giving us a cause for concern,\n\nbecause the fact that the ancient arts are highly coveted encourages\n\nsponsored looting and illicit trafficking of the works by unscrupulous\n\nforeigners and Nigerians.\n\n3. Despite all efforts by the Ministry of Information and Culture\n\nand the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, with the\n\nassistance of law enforcement agencies, to prevent illicit export of\n\nthe nation\u2019s archeological and ethnological materials, widespread\n\nlooting and illicit excavation of these materials still continue. The\n\nstolen artifacts are mostly smuggled to Europe, the United States of\n\nAmerica and other places for the benefit of art collectors.\n\n4. To curb this nefarious activities, Nigeria resorted to the UNESCO\n\n1970 Convention, which enjoins Member States to the Convention, whose\n\ncultural patrimony is in jeopardy from pillage, to call upon other\n\nMember States to\n\nparticipate in concerted international measures, including the control\n\nof exports and imports and international commerce in the specific\n\nmaterials concerned.\n\n5. It is on the basis of this Convention that Nigeria and the United\n\nStates of America have agreed to leverage an American legislation, the\n\nConvention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CPIA), to prevent\n\nthe illicit import of Nigerian artifacts into the United States.\n\n6. This legislation was enacted by the United States to restrict the\n\nimportation into the US of archeological materials ranging in date\n\nfrom 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1770 as well as ethnological materials\n\nincluding those associated with royal\n\nactivity, religious activity, etc. from nations that have entered into\n\nthe kind of bilateral initiative that we are signing here with the\n\nUnited States today..\n\n7. On the basis of this agreement, Nigerian antiquities being\n\nimported into the United States without the requisite Export Permit\n\nwill be seized at the border of the United States and returned to\n\nNigeria without the arduous and costly task of going through the\n\nlabyrinth of judicial and diplomatic processes.\n\n8. We are optimistic that this agreement will reduce the pillage of\n\nour irreplaceable archeological and ethnological materials, as the\n\nmarket for these materials is being shut in the United States against\n\nillicit traffickers.\n\n9. The agreement will last for an initial period of five years. If\n\nit works well, as we anticipate it will, it shall be renewed for a\n\nlonger term. We implore other friendly nations to take a cue from the\n\nUnited States of America and join us in finding means to prevent the\n\nillegal importation of our antiquities into their countries.\n\n10. We want to most sincerely thank the Government of the United\n\nStates, in particular the Embassy of the United States in Nigeria, for\n\nmaking this possible. We look forward to a diligent implementation of\n\nthis landmark agreement, so it can become a game changer in our\n\nefforts to prevent the looting of our priceless ancient works of art.\n\n11. I thank you all for your kind attention.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

I had to stay calm.\u201d\n\nRaducanu, Andy Murray\n\nIn the women\u2019s event British No.1, Emma Raducanu was sent out by world No.98 Danka Kovinic.\n\nRaducanu, the U.S. Open champion, was hampered by a blister on her right hand throughout as Kovinic reached the third round with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 victory.\n\nKovinic will face Romanian Simona Halep or Brazil\u2019s Beatriz Haddad Maia.\n\nThree time Grand Slam winner, Andy Murray may have played his last match at the Australian Open after he was dismissed in three sets, by Japanese qualifier Toro Daniel.\n\nDaniel won 6-4 6-4 6-4.\n\n.\n\nA bitterly disappointed Andy Murray said he might not be back next year if his results this season didn\u2019t match up to his expectations.\n\nThe 34-year-old Scot had high hopes of his return to Melbourne Park after an absence of two years but they were shattered by inspired Japanese qualifier Taro Daniel in three sets on John Cain Arena.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really disappointed. Very frustrated. A tough loss for me, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Murray said after the 6-4 6-4 6-4 defeat to the world number 120.\n\n\u201cI made way too many errors today. Yeah, wasn\u2019t able to turn it around today, but he definitely was solid today. He moved well and deserved to win.\u201d\n\nThree years and two hip operations after he sat in the interview room tearfully proclaiming his career over, Murray said whether he returned to Melbourne Park in 2023 depended on how he got on at big events in 2022.",

alongside legacy issues, such as increased debt service burden and exchange rate convergent.\n\nOther things expected to witness within the year include key amendments to finance Act to support revenue mobilisation such as VAT, excise duty digital and increased supply in the forex market by CBN.\u201d\n\nThe financial experts listed sectors of opportunities in 2022 to include Information Communication Technology, construction Industry, financial services industry, manufacture and agricultural sector.\n\nHe said ICT sector is likely to grow by 9.72 per cent in 2022, telephone penetration will rise sharply, there would be surge in Fintech and mobile payments, Increased level of activities to be supported by 5G operations and the sector would consolidate during the year.\n\nRewane said the\u201d telecom infrastructure would also expand with cable acquisition and top players -MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa- will report profit surge of 72 per cent in 2022 with an average Per Earning ratio of 10.64x, as MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa has return of 13.8 per cent and 24.2 per cent respectively in one year.\u201d\n\nFurther to this, he said construction Industry would grow by 3.07 per cent in 2022 as state governments would also be spending massively as election approaches and roads will be concessioned and tolled.\n\nSimilarly, he projected that construction \u201cindustry giant, Julius Berger is well positioned to benefit from government activities.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nHopes of possible resolution of the confusion around the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 were dimmed as the two chambers of the National Assembly Wednesday differed on the way out of the impasse.\n\nThe upper legislative chamber, had in collaboration with the House of Representatives November last year, as contained in clause 87(2), made direct primaries as the only option for political parties in electing candidates for general elections.\n\nBut refusing to assent the Bill, President Muhammadu Buhari said the provision was undemocratic and serious infraction on Constitution of the various political parties which has different options of direct , indirect and consensus arrangements for such elections.\n\nAccording to the president, signing the Bill into law would have serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences on the country, particularly in view of Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nSenate\u2019s position\n\nAnd as a way out, the Senate concurred with observations raised by the president by rescinding the mandatory direct primaries imposed on political parties for nomination of candidates.\n\nIn doing this, the Senate as listed on its order paper for Wednesday plenary, added indirect and consensus options to the mandatory direct provision earlier proposed.\n\nSpecifically, the upper legislative chamber in Clause 84(2) of the report approved direct, indirect primaries or consensus as procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions.\n\nIt also approved the recommended Clause 84(3) that \u201ca political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party.\u201d\n\nClause 84(4) further provides that \u201ca political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below; (a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, a political party shall, (i) hold special conventions in each of the 36 states of the federation and FCT, where delegates shall vote for each of the aspirants at designated centres in each State Capital on specified dates.\u201d\n\nThe clause provides that a National Convention shall be held for the ratification of the candidate with the highest number of votes.\n\nThe amendment followed a motion for its re-committal to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nSenate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North)\n\nIn his presentation, Abdullahi recalled that President Buhari had signified withholding his assent on the Electoral Act No. 6 2010 (Repeal and Re-enactment) Bill, 2021 which was passed by the National Assembly and forwarded to the President Thursday, 18th November, 2021.\n\nSenator Abdullahi noted that the rational for withholding assent bordered on his observation in Clause 84.\n\nHe, however, explained that the motion for re-committal of the Bill to the Committee on the Whole was against the backdrop of the \u201cneed to address the observation by Mr. President C-in-C and make necessary amendment in accordance with Order 87(c) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 (as amended); and relying on order 1(b) and 52(6) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 ( as amended).\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the chamber rescinded its decision on the affected Clause of the Bill as passed and recommitted same to the Committee of the Whole for consideration and passage.\n\nReps differ\n\nTaking a slightly different position however, the House of Representatives altered the controversial section 84 of the Electoral Act amendment Bill, leaving political parties with the option of adopting either direct or indirect primary mode in nominating candidates for elective positions.\n\nAt the resumption of plenary Tuesday, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila had hinted that the president\u2019s concerns would be addressed, and the Bill returned for his assent.\n\n\n\nBack from a closed door session that lasted about one hour Wednesday, the Speaker announced that the House would go straight into consideration of the single clause adjustment, and a motion to that effect was moved by Chairman Rules and Business Committee of the House Abubakar Fulata.\n\n\n\nThe adjustment which affected clause 84(2) of the original Bill to the effect that \u201cprocedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties shall be by direct or indirect primaries\u201d was subsequently approved in a Committee of the Whole of the House, presided over by Gbajabiamila himself.\n\n\n\n\u2018We were not cowed\u2019\n\nHowever, against the perception that the parliament was cowed into taking President Buhari\u2019s proposal, the House through its spokesman, Benjamin Kalu, insisted the Green Chamber acted to save democracy, noting that beside the controversial clause, there were so many other inherent benefits in the Bill as far as electoral reforms were concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did not jettison direct primary; we only made it an option. Political parties are left with whichever options they prefer according to their realities. There are so many other benefits in the Bill,\u201d Kalu said.\n\n\n\nOn whether the House\u2019s action was not a sharp contrast to the desires of majority of Nigerians, the lawmaker noted that \u201cthe president\u2019s reasons were placed on a good scale, in view of the times we are in before taking the action, as well as being guided by the limited time available to the nation\u2019s electoral umpire.\u201d\n\n\n\nCSOs reject consensus\n\nAnd in their reactions, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) Wednesday rejected the Senate\u2019s decision to introduce a completely new mode of \u201cconsensus\u201d as a procedure for candidates\u2019 nomination.\n\nThey, however, commended the National Assembly for being swift on resumption to review its position on direct primaries as the sole mode for nomination of candidates in the Electoral Bill 2021.\n\nThe CSOs stated this in a joint press statement signed by Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), The Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS),Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF), Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ) in Abuja.\n\nOthers include; Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGO) and Inclusive Friends Association (IFA).\n\nThey described the consensus mode as antithetical to democratic principles and that it would result in the subversion of popular will.\n\nThey further said: \u201cIt violates the rights of aspirants to equal participation in party primaries and limits the choice of voters to candidates who did not emerge from democratic primary elections. Judging from experience, consensus has occasioned a litany of litigations in Nigeria\u2019s electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the Senate to, in line with the popular will of Nigerians; adopt the position of the House of Representatives which now recognizes direct and indirect primaries as procedure for nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cWith this development, a harmonisation committee will now have to be constituted by the leadership of the National Assembly to harmonize the divergent positions of both chambers thereby delaying the speedy conclusion of the process.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call for the immediate withdrawal of this new introduction which is alien to the original Electoral Bill 2021 to speed up the work of the harmonization committee and conclusion of the amendment process on or before the 21 January 2022 deadline.\n\n\u201cAs indicated in our earlier statement, any further delay will undermine public confidence in the process and therefore unacceptable,\u201d they said.\n\nYiaga Africa, others\n\nAlso in a separate position, the Board Chair, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwagwu said, \u201cit is obvious the Senate continues to hoe to its side. The addition of the glaring undemocratic consensus option is a survival strategy. The aspiration of a greater number of citizens is for options that expand the democratic space and not constrict it.\n\n\u201cThey have to quickly go to conference to resolve the difference and our hope is that the National Assembly will transmit a democratic electoral bill to carry the hopes of Nigeria people for inclusive, people centric electoral law.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Director of Programmes Yiaga Africa Cynthia Mbamalu said the group lauded the National Assembly for prioritising the review of the contentious clause 84 on direct primaries in the Electoral Bill 2021 to enable speedy transmission to the president for assent.\n\nShe said considering the urgency of this Bill, it is important the harmonisation committee is constituted immediately to do the needful.\n\nShe, however, noted that in line with citizens\u2019 demand for transparent and credible primaries, the House of Representatives\u2019 version recognising direct and indirect mode of party primaries should be adopted.\n\n\u201cConsensus candidate nomination introduced by the Senate is contrary to the principles of democratic and transparent primaries, limits the right of aspirants to equal participation in primary elections and forces candidates on the people,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a similar reaction, a former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Unions Unity (OATUU), Owei Lakemfa, said: \u201cIt is a game. Many of those in power and can engineer a consensus, want indirect primaries while those out of power or the corridors hope for some luck with direct primaries.\n\n\u201cI know an ex-governor who favoured indirect primaries while in power, but now campaigns for direct primaries. Those who argue that direct primaries would be too expensive have not told Nigerians why and what is considered too expensive.\n\n\u201cFor instance, how much did direct party primaries cost in the Lagos State gubernatorial primaries viz-a-vis indirect primaries in many states?\n\n\u201cThe fact is that most of the parties are not built on democratic foundations so cannot deliver on democratic primaries whether direct or indirect, and certainly would not deliver on democratic dividends.\n\n\u201cI returned from observing elections in Venezuela six weeks ago and observed elections in countries like Zimbabwe and my conclusion is that elections are simple processes, but are difficult in our country because that is the system put in place.\u201d\n\nAPC excited\n\nAnd to a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Ismaeel Ahmed, the decision to afford parties options in electing their candidates is a welcome development.\n\nAhmed told Blueprint that that the party had always believed that political parties should have options in nominating and selecting their candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThe party\u2019s position has always been the same that the National Assembly should allow political parties option on how to nominate their candidates and the president said once that is removed and it is sent to him, he is ready to sign it. So we are excited about the National Assembly\u2019s response to the president\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\n",

          "text": "The first flights carrying fresh water and other aid to Tonga finally arrived Thursday after the Pacific nation\u2019s main airport runway was cleared of ash left by a huge volcanic eruption.\n\nNew Zealand and Australia each sent military transport planes that were carrying water containers, kits for temporary shelters, generators, hygiene supplies and communications equipment. The Australian plane also had a special sweeper to help keep the runway clear.\n\nThe deliveries were dropped off without the military personnel coming in contact with people at the airport in Tonga. That\u2019s because Tonga is desperate to make sure foreigners don\u2019t bring in the coronavirus. It has not had any outbreaks of COVID-19 and has reported just a single case since the pandemic began.\n\nRear Admiral James Gilmour, the commander of New Zealand\u2019s Joint Forces, said there had been a \u201cmammoth effort\u201d by Tongan troops \u201cto clear that runway by hand. And they\u2019ve achieved that this afternoon.\u201d\n\nAustralia said the assistance would help Tonga\u2019s government meet the community\u2019s needs and support the immediate clean-up efforts.\n\nJapan also said it would send emergency relief, including drinking water and equipment for cleaning away volcanic ash. Two C-130 Hercules aircraft and a transport vessel carrying two CH-47 Chinook helicopters would leave possibly Thursday, the Defense Ministry said.\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters that his ministry \u201cwill do everything we can for the disaster-hit people of Tonga.\u201d\n\nU.N. humanitarian officials report that about 84,000 people \u2014 more than 80% of Tonga\u2019s population \u2014 have been impacted by the volcano\u2019s eruption, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said, pointing to three deaths, injuries, loss of homes and polluted water.\n\nCommunications with Tonga remain limited after Saturday\u2019s eruption and tsunami appeared to have broken the single fiber-optic cable that connects Tonga with the rest of the world. That means most people haven\u2019t been able to use the internet or make phone calls abroad, although some local phone networks are still working.\n\nOne phone company, Digicel, said Thursday it had managed to restore the ability to make international calls from some places by using a satellite link, but that people would need to be patient due to high demand. It said it hoped to enhance its service over the coming days.\n\nA navy patrol ship from New Zealand is also expected to arrive later Thursday. It is carrying hydrographic equipment and divers, and also has a helicopter to assist with delivering supplies.\n\nOfficials said the ship\u2019s first task would be to check shipping channels and the structural integrity of the wharf in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, following the eruption and tsunami.\n\nAnother New Zealand navy ship carrying 250,000 liters (66,000 gallons) of water is on its way. The ship can also produce tens of thousands of liters of fresh water each day using a desalination plant.\n\nThree of Tonga\u2019s smaller islands suffered serious damage from tsunami waves, officials and the Red Cross said.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Dujarric said \u201call houses have apparently been destroyed on the island of Mango and only two houses remain on Fonoifua island, with extensive damage reported on Nomuka.\u201d He said evacuations are underway for people from the islands.\n\nAccording to Tongan census figures, Mango is home to 36 people, Fonoifua is home to 69 people, and Nomuka to 239. The majority of Tongans live on the main island of Tongatapu, where about 50 homes were destroyed.\n\nDujarric said the most pressing humanitarian needs are safe water, food and non-food items, and top priorities are reestablishing communication services including for international calls and the internet.\n\nTonga has so far avoided the widespread devastation that many initially feared.",

          "text": "Face masks will no longer be mandatory in public places and COVID-19 passports will be dropped for large events as infections level off in most parts of the country, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday.\n\nJohnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because government scientists think it is likely that the surge of infections prompted by the highly contagious omicron variant \u201chas now peaked nationally.\u201d\n\nWhile hospitals in northern England still are getting pressed by high caseloads and infections were still rising in schools, Johnson said hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units elsewhere in England were stabilizing or falling.\n\nThe government is no longer advising people to work from home, and compulsory face masks will be scrapped in secondary school classrooms starting Thursday.\n\nMandatory COVID-19 passes will not be needed to gain entry to large-scale events beginning Jan. 27. Face masks will no longer be legally required anywhere in England as of that day.\n\n\u201cWe will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe restrictions were introduced in December to slow the rapid spread of the omicron variant and buy time for the population to get their booster vaccine shot.\n\nJohnson said Wednesday that more than 90% of those over age 60 in the U.K. have had booster shots.\n\nOfficial figures showed that COVID-19 infections have dropped in most parts of the U.K. for the first time since early December. The government reported 108,069 new cases on Wednesday, about half the daily number recorded over the holidays.\n\nThe requirement for those infected to self-isolate for five full days remains, but Johnson said that measure will also end in the coming weeks. He said while the self-isolation rule expires on March 24, he will seek to scrap it earlier if the virus data continues to improve.\n\nJohnson and Health Secretary Sajid Javid both suggested that the government is planning for a post-pandemic period when it can treat COVID-19 more like the flu.\n\n\u201cThere will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don\u2019t place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nNonetheless, Johnson urged people to remain cautious in the last weeks of winter and stressed that the pandemic was \u201cnot over.\u201d\n\nThe news was welcomed by businesses, especially those relying on workers re-populating city centers, as well as hospitality and tourism. But some said officials need to give more details about their plans to cope with the coronavirus in the longer term. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the government would publish such a plan \u201cshortly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vital need now for greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term. Swinging back and forth between restrictions and normality has been damaging,\u201d said Matthew Fell, chief policy director of the Confederation of British Industry.\n\nScotland and Wales, which set their own public health rules, have also announced similar easing of restrictions.\n\nBritain has the second-worst pandemic death toll in Europe after Russia, with over 153,000 confirmed virus-related deaths.",

          "text": "The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said he would need to consult with relevant agencies to know the exact position of government on whether or not fuel subsidy would be stopped this year.\n\nMohammed, who spoke with newsmen after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Wednesday at the State House, Abuja, explained that he was going to initiate a fact-finding process to determine the state of things on the removal of petroleum subsidy following Tuesday\u2019s announcement by Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, that President Muhammadu Buhari had not told anyone to remove fuel subsidy.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the issue since the 2022 budget had no subsidy provision beyond June, 2022, the minister said he needed to consult with the relevant government agencies to determine the exact position of the subsidy removal question.\n\n\u201cAs for the removal of fuel subsidy, I think you will give me time to consult with relevant departments and ministries and I will get back to you,\u201d the minister.\n\nLast October, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had announced that the federal government made provision for petrol subsidy only for the first six months of 2022 as the government looked towards a complete deregulation of the sector.\n\nShe had said: \u201cIn our 2022 budget, we only factored in subsidy for the first half of the year; the second half of the year, we are looking at complete deregulation of the sector, saving foreign exchange and potentially earning more from the oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nReacting to Ahmed\u2019s position after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja on Tuesday, Lawan had told newsmen that Buhari had not directed anyone in his government to implement the removal of petroleum subsidy,\n\nBut he had also conceded that subsidy was a big burden, noting that a solution had to be found to it.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, it will be of interest to Nigerians to hear what I\u2019ve come to discuss with Mr. President among several other things. Many of us are very concerned with the recent agitations, protests, and many citizens were so concerned, our constituents across the country are very concerned that the federal government will remove the petroleum subsidy. And for us, as parliamentarians, as legislators representing the people of Nigeria, this must be of interest to us.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "In line with his administration\u2019s commitment to traffic management and transportation, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has acquired two sets of 10-car new Talgo 330kmph speed trains for the Lagos Red Line rail project.\n\nTHISDAY reliably learnt that, the State government had wanted to purchase three sets that had been lying unused in Milwaukee for 11 years but got there to find that Egypt had acquired one of the trains.\n\nThe trains originally intended for a high-speed rail line to connect Madison and Milwaukee were enmeshed in complicated political issues before Lagos state government decided to acquire them.\n\nA statement on Wednesday, explained that Sanwo-Olu completed the acquisition deal of the trains at a public event inside the Milwaukee facilities of Spanish train manufacturer Talgo Incorporated in the United States, on Tuesday.\n\nThe trains would be heading to Lagos, Nigeria for the Red Line, a 37 km track rail project started by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nThe red line would have 11 stations and when completed would be the first operational metro system in West Africa, the statement explained.\n\nLagos State Government had last November announced traffic diversion at Kayode Ogunmokun road in Mushin for a period of six weeks in continuation of the first phase of the Lagos Red Line Rail Mass Transit project from Oyingbo to Agbado.\n\nSpeaking at the event, who was accompanied by the Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde; Special Adviser to the Governor on Works, Engr. Aramide Adeyoye and Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), Engr. Abimbola Akinajo, said the state government was excited to complete the purchase of the two brand new trains. He said they were in Milwaukee to see things for themselves in respect of the purchase of the trains, adding that they had inspected the trains, seen their configuration and were satisfied that they fit into the tracks of the Red line in Lagos.\n\n\u201cA train is not something you can just go on the shelf and pick up. We are very lucky to get brand new trains. We have seen our beautiful white and red trains.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, the rail line is called Red Line and you can see they have given us the colour. We are just going to brand it and put up our seal there.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this (purchase of the trains) will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial business relationship. Providing source of livelihood for our citizens is all about providing jobs for our people and that is what we are doing. It is about ensuring that we can build our economy; people can move from one location to another and businesses can grow.\n\n\u201cPart of what we have done in the last two and half years is to have what we call Integrated Urban Mass transportation system, where we will be using road infrastructure, waterway infrastructure and rail infrastructure so that we can move over 20 million Lagosians within and around the city,\u201d he said.\n\nThe acting Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who received Sanwo-Olu and other government officials in the city, said: \u201cIt is a little bittersweet. I am sending my congratulations to the Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria, but also a little disappointed that we missed out on the opportunity to have those train sets operating here in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking the CEO and President, Talgo USA Antonio Perez, said \u201cFor us, it is important that our trains are utilised. It doesn\u2019t make any good for the trains that we built to be stored and kept without passengers riding them.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu accompanied by the Lagos State delegation during the visit inspected the interior design of the newly acquired Talgo 330kmph intra-city metropolitan trains.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of his administration on May 29, 2019, Governor Sanwo-Olu has maintained his administration\u2019s commitment to bringing the Red Line project to fruition during the lifetime of his government.\n\n\u201cThe governor has specifically promised Lagosians that the first phase of the Red Line will begin by the last quarter of 2022 or first quarter of 2023, with a capacity of 500,000 passengers daily,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIn 2009, Wisconsin\u2019s then-Governor, Jim Doyle, a Democrat, had announced a deal with Talgo for two new trains to be built in the state and used for a high-speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nIn the same year, Wisconsin was awarded $810 million for the project in a federal stimulus bill.\n\nBut the plan died off after Republican Scott Walker became governor. But by 2012, Talgo had built the trains, and sent an invoice to the state and later that year, Talgo terminated the contract and sued the state, kicking off a court dispute that lasted almost three years.\n\nHowever, some concerned Lagos residents are querying the whereabout of the Toronto subway cars that the government reportedly purchased 10 years ago for rail line in the state. The trains were then reported to have left Canada for Lagos, but nothing was heard about it thereafter.",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Yet to Zone Party Positions Ahead of Convention",
          "text": "The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has denied reports that it had zoned some party positions ahead of its national convention slated for February 26.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, who described the report in some sections of the media as untrue, said the committee has yet to take a position on zoning.\n\nBut the party leadership has, however, released the convention timetable and programme of activities, even as it has beefed up security around the party\u2019s secretariat.\n\nIn the same breath, the immediate past National Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Dr. Sani Shinkafi, has also joined the APC chairmanship race of the party.\n\nHowever, the secretary, while giving an update on the state of the party, said, \u201cWe are also here to rebuff the fake news going round the social media that we have zoned party offices; we are yet to meet on the issue of zoning.\u201d\n\nThe Caretaker Committee at its 19th regular meeting on Wednesday considered and adopted the timetable/schedule of activities for the convention.\n\nThe party said sales of forms to all aspirants vying for national offices would commence on February 14th, while submission of completed forms and accompanying documents at party secretariat was slated on or before February 19.\n\nThe APC scheduled the publication of sub-committees for February 19th, while screening of all aspirants vying for national offices would take place between February 20th and 22nd.\n\nAlso, the party said the sitting of appeal panels to hear and resolve complaints arising from the screening exercise has been slated for February 23, while accreditation of all statutory and elected delegates to the National Convention was scheduled for February 24th and 25th.\n\nIt concluded that the national convention to elect national officers to the National Executive Committee (NEC) would take place on the 26th, while the National Convention Appeal was scheduled for February 28.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the APC leadership has beefed up security at the party secretariat in Abuja as the meeting of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (APC) entered the second day.\n\nThe Caretaker committee could not reach a logical conclusion on the venue, and modalities of the convention of the party slated for February 26. The increased security presence at party\u2019s headquarters might not be unconnected to the continued power play that forced the committee to fix February 26 for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nMen of the Nigerian Police Fire were stationed at strategic locations along the Blantyre Street of the secretariat.\n\nA party source hinted that the increase security presence was more like a routine exercise, adding that most times, the party also took action based on intels, and that there would be several meetings on the composition of sub-committees for the national convention, hence the need to ensure safety of everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, member of the party from Bayelsa State, Mr. Ambrosini Sambo, has described the alleged zoning of the APC chairmanship to the North West as a plot to destroy the party.\n\nSambo, who spoke with journalists yesterday in Abuja, said there were plans to impose a chairman on the party through the rumoured zoning to the North-west.\n\n\u201cThis spells doom for the party. The decision to impose this candidate from the North-West on the party as the chairman will destabilise the party. Every well-meaning party member should not support this.\n\n\u201cThis is the plan of the enemies APC to destroy the party which we fought so hard to build, we will resist this move. The party Chairman is open to other zones to contest,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in what he described as injustice to the party before it would be too late.\n\nOn his party, Shinkafi, who just joined the APC chairmanship race, is believed to being sponsored by the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle.\n\nHe, however, said the state was not ready to lose the slot considering the fact that a former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, who had indicated interest to contest for the position was technically not a member of the ruling party at the moment.\n\nHe insisted that during the recent revalidation and registration exercise conducted in the state, Yari and some other party stakeholders in the state refused to participate.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirant argued that contrary to perception, he was not in the race to whittle down the influence and chances of Yari, but explained that Yari\u2019s decision to boycott the revalidation and registeration exercise has already disqualified him from the race.\n\n\u201cTo me Abdulaziz Yari knows who I am. He\u2019s one of my best friends in those days before he became governor and turned himself into a mini-god. Before me and Matawalle became friends, I have been friends with Yari.\n\n\u201cAs far as the national record of APC is concerned, in my text of press briefing, I have made more emphasis on the credible and verifiable membership register. I challenge you and I challenge everyone here to go and meet Abdulazeez Yari and ask him, let him show you his authentic and revalidated membership card as a card carrying member of APC.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, he is already automatically disqualified from this race and based on that I don\u2019t want our state to take risk of not participating, or not taking slot in our great party and I have decided to join the race. You can go and verify from his ward, his name is not on the register and he doesn\u2019t have authentic membership card,\u201d Shinkafi stated.\n\nHe said if and when elected as national chairman of the party, he would reposition and reorganise the party based on its philosophy of social democracy, which basically meant people-oriented, membership mobilisation and recruitment and mass based political organisation.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
