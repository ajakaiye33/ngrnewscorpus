          "text": "One person has been shot and three vehicles burnt after officials of the Nigeria Customs Service and residents of Ayetoro in the Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State engaged in a violent clash.\n\nThe incident which occured on Friday evening led to the burning of three Customs vehicles and shooting of a youth, popularly known in the community as Soliu.\n\nAn eyewitness, Razak Adeyemi, told newmen that trouble started after a heated argument ensued between a Customs official and a resident suspected to be a smuggler. The matter was said to have been later resolved and both parties went their separate ways.\n\nHe added that about an hour later, four fully-loaded Customs Hilux vehicles stormed the community, with the officers shooting continuously in the air.\n\nThe development reportedly angered the youths in the community, leading to violent face-off between the officers and youths in the community.\n\nAdeyemi stated, \u201cIt all started like a normal argument between a man and a Customs official at Oke Rori, here in Ayetoro. They had a few minutes of arguments, after which military men and residents wadded into the issue and it was resolved.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later, four Hilux vans, with fully armed Customs officials entered our community and they started shooting anyhow in the air. After several attempts to stop them became fruitless, the youths in the area then faced them and they started shooting at the people.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of Ayetoro, who simply identified himself as Nojeeem, claimed that the officials were shooting \u201cas if they had been ordered to wipe out the community.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you see the way they were shooting, it was like a war zone, like they have been told to kill us all. If not because many of our youths are fortified, many would have been dead by now. One man called Soliu who was shot three times.\u201d\n\nWhen asked of the victim\u2019s whereabouts, Nojeem said he had been taken away by his family members to a traditional care centre.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer of NCS, Ogun Area 1 Command, Hammed Oloyede, confirmed the incident.\n\nOloyede noted that the command had commenced investigation into the reasons for the clash.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe situation is currently under investigation.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "\u2018Redefining orthodontic practice in Nigeria\u2019",
          "text": ".\n\n\n\n\u2026The Smile Hub Introduces clear aligners for cutting-edge care\n\nTo ensure that more Nigerians with orthodontic needs have access to premium care without leaving the shores of the country, boutique clinic, The Smilehub is poised to deliver specialist orthodontics services.\n\nServices ranging from diagnosis to prevention and correction of malpositioned teeth, jaws, and misaligned bite patterns. The SmileHub has introduced removable clear aligners to make orthodontic care more accessible to a larger swarth of the population and less disruptive to their lifestyles.\n\nAccording to the clinic lead team, Dr. Bunmi Tokede, The SmileHub came about because they wanted to provide world-class specialist orthodontic care to adults and adolescents here in Nigeria, as orthodontic care is a highly specialised and very challenging aspect of dentistry.\n\n\u201cAlmost all Orthodontic treatments in Nigeria is currently performed using braces (fixed to the teeth). Removable appliances (clear aligners) represent a virtually non-existent \u2018black market\u2019 driven by patients who are aware of the availability and advantages of clear aligners but lack access to it through official service providers, which do not exist currently in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis absence means that orthodontists do not recommend clear aligners and have little to no experience with clear aligner therapy, hence patients often have to travel abroad to obtain competent clear aligner care.\u201d\n\nThe triple trained Harvard graduate and Associate Professor of Orthodontics and Informatics in the United States, noted that aligners are a well-documented alternative to braces, and are currently one of the most consequential innovations in dentistry of the 21st century. They are preferred to braces because they are less disruptive to patients\u2019 lifestyle.\u201d\n\nConsequently, The SmileHub primarily provides world-class aligner care to people who reside in Nigeria with cutting-edge diagnostic radiological services, as well as professional dental cleanings (prophylaxis, scaling and polishing).\n\n\u201cOur team is uniquely trained in this specialty and we are motivated to share our passion and competence with Nigerians and Africans.\n\nOur vision is to elevate the quality of healthcare delivery in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nDr. Tokede assured that the clinic is keen on the highest quality in niche dental care service. \u201cWe continue to evolve as a practice to work with each patient in meeting their healthcare needs. We offer both in-person and virtual consultations so people who live further away can still benefit from our expertise. We provide timely care because we are mindful of our patients\u2019 schedules. We use the latest in dental monitoring technologies in order to provide continuing remote care and our core values are integrity, compassion and excellence.\n\nMany of our patients have crowded teeth, spaces between their teeth, protruding teeth, tongue/thumb habits, open bites, under bites among others. While many are adults, some are kids and location isn\u2019t a limitation because orthodontic care can be scheduled ahead of time to coincide with travel. We already have patients from Port Harcourt, Abuja, London, Chicago and even Delhi.\u201d",

As students, we aren\u2019t happy with the news of the constant abduction of fellow students in some parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, we decided to work on an idea about a company called Paramount Guard, which seeks to offer security services to school students, not only in Nigeria but all over the world. The company plans to introduce AirGuard Wearable, which pairs with the AirGuard App to help students quickly alert family members and friends when in a critical situation or a state of emergency,\u201d they said.\n\nMrs Magdalene Okrikri, the secondary school principal at Greensprings Anthony campus expressed her happiness in the students\u2019 advancement to the final stage of the competition. She said, \u201cLooking at the total number of students that participated in this competition, I consider the emergence of our students as finalists to be a great feat. This achievement is a testament to Greensprings School\u2019s drive to raise young entrepreneurs. We are indeed very proud of them and I wish them success in the final.\u201d\n\nThe Young Tycoon Business Competition is organized by a consortium of the world\u2019s top universities and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, with the aim to motivate and mentor aspiring high-school entrepreneurs across the globe. The competition started in May, and the finalists have gone through three rounds, in which they submitted their business ideas, developed their business plans, and defended their pitch decks. The fourth \u2013 and final \u2013 round will take place at a later date yet to be advised.",

Although details of the cause of her death are still sketchy.\n\nOniga was a popular actress in both the English and Yoruba language film industry. Launching her acting career in 1993, she grew to become a household name in the industry, starring in Wale Adenuga\u2019s popular TV series \u2018Super Story\u2019 as well as films like \u2018Onome\u2019, and \u2018Chief Daddy\u2019.\n\nUntil her death, the actress was said to have been on set for an upcoming movie.

          "text": "*Threatens sanctions against members scheming parallel meetings\n\n*Buni considers his options\n\n*Party chieftain wants court to stop congresses, National Convention over Buni\u2019s chairmanship\n\nAdedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nRattled by last Wednesday\u2019s minority judgement of the Supreme Court on the Ondo State governorship election, which punched holes in the legality of the actions of its National Caretaker Committee\u2019s Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, members of the All Progressives Congress\u2019 Caretaker Committee yesterday scampered to the Minister of Justice/Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, for advice on whether to go ahead with today\u2019s ward congresses.\n\nOn the same day, a chieftain of the APC from Abia State, Kalu Agu, asked a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the APC from going ahead with its ward congresses today, as well as subsequent local governments, states, zonal congresses, and the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nAs for Buni, sources said he was also distressed by the Supreme Court indictment, and \u201che is seriously weighing his options about either staying as party Chair or returning to his job as Yobe State governor.\u201d\n\nAnother source said the decision to consult Malami on the issue was in conformity with the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOf course, Malami, after an elaborate analysis, cleared the Caretaker Committee to proceed with the ward congresses, assuring that Buni\u2019s continued stay as Chair would not portend any crisis for the party.\n\nThe sources said Malami told the caretaker members that the Supreme Court judgement did not render the committee illegal and that it still \u201chas legal capacity to undertake any action on behalf and in the name of the party.\u201d\n\nMalami said further that the judgement did not question the legality of all the actions taken by the Buni-committee since inception.\n\nA member of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Prof. Mamman Tahir, who confirmed this development, while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said Malami assured that Buni\u2019s stay was legal, and would not turn the congresses into a nullity.\n\nTahir stated: \u201cI am here this afternoon to reconfirm that our Congresses are on course to hold tomorrow (Saturday) and this Committee is working closely with the Attorney-General of the Federation and he has offered advice that we are on good ground and we are comfortable with that position.\n\n\u201cSo, our programmes will continue to roll on in the normal course of things. We want to assure teeming members of the APC across the country to come out and elect officers at the ward levels. This party believes so much in grassroots politics, grassroots democracy; that is the strength of the party.\n\n\u201cI call on all members to come out tomorrow and elect leaders of their choice at the Ward level before the party moves to the next stage of the democratisation process.\u201d\n\nAsked if Congresses will hold in Zamfara and Anambra, Tahir said: \u201cAnother date is being fixed for those states because we have an election coming up in Anambra. We don\u2019t want to jeopardise our position there. Though in Zamfara, only recently, they are still doing their validation and continuation of membership registration. So that is the position.\u201d\n\nAPC Reads Riot Act, Warns against Parallel Congress\n\nThe National Secretary of APC\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe, was also buoyed by Malami\u2019s assurances, issued a statement yesterday, saying today\u2019s ward congresses would go ahead as planned.\n\nAkpanudoedehe warned that any parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office would not be tolerated by the national leadership of the party ahead of the ward congresses.\n\nIn a notice to party members, he said the APC would deploy the full weight of the law as stipulated in Section 21(D) of the party\u2019s Constitution on any one who engaged in such act.\n\nIn the notice, the party said it was important that the attention of all party faithful be drawn to the resolution of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of 8th December, 2020, which subsists and extends to the conduct of party members during the congresses.\n\nThe APC re-stated that all pending litigations instituted by members against the party should be withdrawn forthwith, \u201cand going forward, no member should institute matters against the party, without exhausting the internal mechanism for conflict resolution, as enshrined in the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party said as a result of the above, party members should note that all activities that may be carried out by persons to put the party and its officers in bad light, before, during and after the congresses should be jettisoned.\n\nIt added: \u201cAll activities or processes congresses and thereafter which do not have the approval of the CECPC are exercises in futility. This is to say that: any purported; parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office, is to say the least a nullity. These divisive activities will not be tolerated.\n\nIn its split judgment of four against three by the seven member-panel, which sat on the Ondo governorship election petition, the Supreme Court had contended that the reason it did not sack Governor Akeredolu, was because the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in the October 10, 2020 election, Eyitayo Jegede, failed to join Buni in the suit, even when the issues revolved around him.\n\nAlthough Justice Mary Odili, in a dissenting minority verdict, upheld Jegede\u2019s appeal that the nomination of Akeredolu, which was signed by Buni, was not valid under Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAfter the judgement, the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, was the first to advise the APC to halt all preparations and conduct of congresses nationwide forthwith, having analysed the implications of the judgment.\n\nSaid Keyamo: \u201cThe planned congresses across the country slated for this weekend must immediately be suspended, because it will be an exercise in futility as analysed above. The competence of Governor Buni to organise the congresses has been called to question by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nBuni Sues for Peace\n\nMeanwhile, Buni, has enjoined party stakeholders and members to conduct the exercise peacefully.\n\nBuni, in a statement issued yesterday called on officials conducting the Congress to be fair and objective to all candidates contesting the election.\n\nThe chairman warned that the party would not hesitate to take decisive measures against anyone who deliberately sabotage the Congress.\n\nHe noted that adequate arrangements had been made by the party to conduct successful and acceptable congresses across the country.\n\nBuni said: \u201cAs stakeholders of the party, we have great responsibility to make the ward Congress in all the participating states successful. We should endeavour to place the party and members\u2019 interests above personal interests.\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way repositioning the party, we have reconciled many groups and individuals, we must not allow personal interests in this election to divide us and draw us back.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman also charged aggrieved members to channel their grievances to the appropriate quarters at the party secretariat.\n\nCourt Stops Imo Congress\n\nThe APC Ward congresses in Imo State have been stopped by an Abuja federal high court.\n\nJustice Valentine Oriji, in his ruling on the suit filed by Okey Anyikwa, who is the APC Chairman in Ideato South Local Government Area, threatened to invalidate the outcome of congresses if the party disregards the position of the Court.\n\nAnyikwa had approached the court to stop the APC in the state from going ahead with the congresses because of the judgement of the Appeal Court that upheld the tenure of the state\u2019s Exco elected in 2018.\n\nAll action regarding APC congresses in the state are to be placed on hold, pending the hearing of the application slated for August 10.\n\nAPC Chieftain, Kalu Asks Court to Halt Party\u2019s Congresses\n\nA chieftain of the APC from Abia State, Mr Kalu Agu, yesterday asked a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the APC from going ahead with its planned Ward congress scheduled for today as well as subsequent local governments, states, zonal Congresses and the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nAgu in the suit marked CV/1812/2021, dated July 29 and filed July 30, 2021 is also asking the court to declare as null and void, any of the APC\u2019s congresses and convention held under the current acting National Chairman of the APC\u2019s Caretaker Committee.\n\nThe suit filed by his lawyer, Ukpai Ukairo, has the APC and Buni as first and second defendants respectively.\n\nThe plaintiff by the suit is claiming that the second defendant was never elected at any congress to run the affairs of the APC, adding that the party\u2019s Constitution does not allow any person who holds an executive position to occupy any position in any of its organs.\n\nIn a 38 paragraph affidavit deposed to in support of the suit, the plaintiff, stated that Buni \u201cis being sued solely in his capacity as henchman of the usurpers of the functions of the organs and elected officers of the first defendant and as representing the other usurpers of the functions of the organs and elected officers of the first defendant.\u201d\n\nAgu, who disclosed that he intends to contest for the position of National Legal Adviser of the APC during the party\u2019s next convention said his interest would be affected by \u201ca co\u00f1duct of a congress superintended by the second defendant who is a sitting Governor of Yobe State and also discharging the functions of the elected National Chairman and the National Working Committee of the first defendant\u201d.\n\nWhile claiming that APC does not have an elected ward congress and that Buni is not also elected, the deponent added that \u201csome persons not known to the Constitution of the party are determined to come together and appoint themselves as ward executive committee, thereby excluding him from the process of contesting for the said position.\n\nAmong the issues he wants the court to determine are: whether the APC can conduct a ward congress when there is no elected ward executive committee of the APC.\n\nHe further wants the court to determine whether the APC can lawfully conduct a ward congress, local government congress, state congress, zonal congress, national convention for the election of officers into the various levels of the structure of the APC established by the constitution of the APC for its administration when it has usurpers of the functions of the organs and elected officers of the APC who are not elected in accordance with the 1999 Constitution, the Electoral Act and the APC\u2019s Constitution.\n\nHe sought an order of mandatory injunction setting aside any decision, act, steps, notifications taken or made out for the purpose of holding any ward, Local Government, State, Zonal Congresses or National Convention of the party.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Case instituted two days before IMN\u2019s leader was freed by court\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Dari Bayero yesterday confirmed to THISDAY that the government had filed fresh charges bordering on terrorism and treasonable felony against the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky.\n\nHe said the new charges were filed on July 26, at the federal High Court, Kaduna, just two days before the IMN\u2019s leader and his wife, Zeenat, were freed by Justice Gideon Kurada on eight count charge of culpable homicide, disruption of public peace, unlawful assembly among others.\n\nBayero said the fresh charges of terrorism and treasonable felony against El-Zakzaky would be jointly prosecuted by the Federal and Kaduna State governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe terrorism case was filed based on the utterances of El-Zakzaky, under section 17 (A) of the Terrorism Prevention Act 2013. He will face a nine-count charge at the Federal High Court, Kaduna. We even attempted to serve him while in prison before the ruling, he refused to collect it. There is evidence to that effect. An affidavit will be duly sworn to that effect. We couldn\u2019t move forward quickly because the Federal High Court is on vacation.\n\n\u201cThis case is supposed to be done in conjunction with the federal government. The Federal Ministry of Justice will send a team to come and prosecute with us.\u201d\n\nBayero also said the state government would appeal against the no case ruling of the state High Court in favour of the IMN\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cOf course we will appeal against the ruling. We have applied for the ruling and as soon as that is made available to us, we will go on appeal. Definitely we will go on appeal. We have informed the court on our decision to appeal against the ruling,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, in his reaction, the spokesman of the IMN, Ibrahim Musa, said he was not aware of any new case filed against El-Zakzaky in any court.\n\n\u201cMy findings indicated that there are no court papers served to our leader. Definitely we are not aware of the charge in another court,\u201d Musa said.\n\nHe, however, admitted that a day before the judgement of the state High Court, there was an attempt to serve El-Zakzaky some court papers.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that a day before the judgment at the state High Court, they tried to make such moves but there was no judge assigned, no court assigned for the case and we were not served with the papers.\n\n\u201cSo it might be an attempt by them. But in reality our Sheikh or his lawyers have not been served any court papers,\u201d the IMN spokesman told THISDAY.\n\nIn the no case submission filed by El-Zakzaky\u2019s counsels, led by Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Justice Kurada declared that the IMN\u2019s leader and his wife, who had been in detention for over five years, had no case to answer, because the Kaduna government failed to establish a prima facie case against the defendants, and accordingly discharged and acquitted them.\n\nShortly after his victory in court on Wednesday, El-Zakzaky and his wife were immediately discharged from the Kaduna Correctional Centre.\n\nSources said they were taken to a resident of one of his followers in Abuja, \u201cbecause his Zaria residence and properties of the IMN had been demolished by the Kaduna State Government after his arrest in December 2015.\u201d\n\nThe source said El-Zakzaky\u2019s family members, his followers and well-wishers, had been visiting him in his new abode in Abuja since Thursday.\n\nMusa said the IMN leader\u2019s left Kaduna for Abuja on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe is now in Abuja, I can\u2019t say he has a house in Abuja, but you know as somebody with many followers, he will not lack a place to stay,\u201d Musa said.\n\nDefence Team Celebrates Victory\n\nAfter El-Zakzaky\u2019s victory in court last Wednesday, an elated counsel to the defendants, Marshal Abubakar who represented the lead counsel in the suit, Falana, declared: The trial of Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat has come to an end as the court found them not guilty of the alleged crime filed against them by the Kaduna State Government.\n\n\u201cThe court found that the charges that were filed in 2018 pursuant to the Penal Law enacted by the state government in 2017 over an alleged offence committed in 2015, were incompetent.\n\n\u201cThe court ruled that the charge was not supposed to be filed in the first place, as the government cannot arraign someone for a said crime that was not an offence at the time.\n\n\u201cThe court ruled that the charge was incompetent, as the court agreed that El-Zakzaky and his wife had committed no offence.\n\n\u201cThe court also holds that the event of December 12, 2015 and December 15, 2015 was not an offence and the court was emphatic that none of the events on December 12, 2015 can be attributed to the defendants for an offence.\u201d\n\nEl-Zakzaky, Wife Arrested in December 2015\n\nEl-Zakzaky and his wife were arrested in December 2015, following a clash between his followers and soldiers in Zaria, Kaduna State.\n\nHis followers, who were observing a religious ritual, allegedly blocked the highway and refused to allow passage of the convoy of the then Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (now retired), who was in Zaria for the Passing Out Parade of the military school in the area.\n\nThe IMN members allegedly turned down all appeal to allow the convoy of the army chief go pass, leading to confrontation.\n\nThe following day, soldiers allegedly sealed off the headquarters of the IMN in Zaria, and that there was a bloody clash.\n\nNo fewer than 347 members of the IMN were killed and buried in a mass grave in the Mando area of Kaduna metropolis.\n\nWhile in detention, his followers persistently protested in major cities, like Abuja, Kaduna, Kano, and Sokoto, demanding for his release.\n\nSome of their protests often resulted in deaths, following violent clashes with security agencies, especially the police.\n\nIn December 2016, an Abuja Federal High Court under trial Justice Gabriel Kolawole ordered the release of the IMN\u2019s leader and his wife on the grounds that their continuous incarceration was unconstitutional and an infringement on their fundamental human rights.\n\nThe court had also awarded N50 million compensation to the duo and ordered the federal government to provide a new accommodation for them in Zaria or any northern town of their choice. But the federal government refused to free him until the eventual judgement on Wednesday that set him free.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, is presently hospitalised in Maryland, the United States, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that Tinubu, who has had several medical trips this year alone, had a surgery last week and could be billed for another one over a yet-to-be-disclosed illness.\n\nBola Tinubu\n\nThe APC National Leader has been off official and party functions in the country for a long time, amidst talks that he is being positioned for the 2023 presidency to succeed the incumbent repressive regime of Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cTinubu is hospitalised in Maryland, US. His health is failing. He couldn\u2019t participate in launching his Arewa library, and he couldn\u2019t participate in the Local Government Area elections last week. He could not attend today\u2019s APC congress due to health reasons.\n\n\u201cHe had a surgery last week,\u201d an authoritative source disclosed.\n\nIn January 2021, Tinubu was also reported sick and hospitalised in Paris, France.

          "title": "Abba Kyari: Superstar cop in the soup",
          "text": "Mallam Abba Alhaji Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police widely celebrated as \u201cSuper Cop\u201d, dotes on limelight like an ant on sugar. But the celebrity cop may be seeing the dying days of his super stardom with his stinging indictment in the US. The principal character in the case is the self-confessed Nigerian inter-continental scam artist, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, best known as Hushpuppi. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has secured a warrant of arrest to pick up Kyari, who has denied all allegations \u2014 notably the one that he, for a fee, helped Hushpuppi arrest, detain and torture one Vincent Chibuzor, said to be Hushpuppi\u2019s co-fraudster who had snitched on him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHushpuppi, who \u2014 like Kyari \u2014 is an indigene of Instagram, was arrested in Dubai in June 2020 over allegations of hacking, impersonation, scamming, banking fraud and identity theft. Eleven of his associates were also picked up. They were extradited to the US. Hushpuppi has already pleaded guilty to money laundering charges, which means he may spend up to 20 years behind bars. But the real shock for me, and I guess many Nigerians, is the extent of the alleged involvement of Kyari in the network of fraudsters. He has denied the allegations, mumbling something under his breath about native clothes and caps. Police authorities in Nigeria say they will do an \u201cinternal review\u201d.\n\nI may here confess that I used to be a fan of Kyari. About 12 years ago, a senior friend had narrated to me how his car was stolen somewhere in Yaba, Lagos state. Kyari led the team of police officers that eventually recovered the car and arrested the suspects. I started hearing good things about the officer, and I was not surprised when he eventually got double promotion. He began to hold sensitive positions and was delivering results, as far as my eyes could see. I was happy. Everybody who knows me very well can testify that I am ever guilty of always looking for Nigerian heroes and role models to celebrate in the midst of the bad news that always surrounds us. Kyari fitted the bill.\n\nI never celebrated him in my writings, but I used word of mouth to speak good things about him, even though we have never met or spoken or had any contact whatsoever. My opinion of him was based on what people I respect were saying. But I was very uncomfortable with his celebrity lifestyle. A police officer, or any law enforcement officer, should always be discreet and remain as faceless as possible. To start with, you are going after criminals. You can easily be the target of gangs who may want to harm you. Discretion is vital. My discomfort turned to disgust when I started hearing about the activities of his boys and how they were living large. Another Nigerian hope betrayed, oh dear!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if we are to be candid, it is because things are so weird and warped in Nigeria that we would be celebrating police officers for arresting criminals. What else is their job? Is it to be blaring siren all over the place? To be carrying suitcases for politicians and their girlfriends? To be speeding recklessly on the road, driving against traffic and parking in places clearly marked \u201cNo Parking\u201d? To be drinking gin and playing \u201cBaba Ijebu\u201d at 8am as those ones on Kaffi Street, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, do every day? To be waylaying and extorting motorists? I must regret that we celebrate mediocrity too much in this country and that is why many of us cannot cultivate or understand excellence.\n\nYou cannot really blame me, I would plead. In a country where it is alleged that police officers randomly arrest sex workers and rape them as part of \u201cfringe benefits\u201d, that police officers give weapons to robbers, that you go to report murder at the police station and they demand for money to do investigation, you cannot but celebrate the Kyaris that come along your way once in a Blue Moon. That is a rare commodity in the police force. I have to restrain myself from commenting on the specific allegations against Kyari before he exercises his right to defend himself, but some of us already have enough knowledge of the policing system to come to some reasoned conclusions.\n\nWithout prejudice to the police investigation, the right of Kyari to clear his name, and the actual resolution of the US case, I want to make the following preliminary and general observations. One, the way Nigerians use the police to settle personal scores is something we have to address in order to stop urinating on the rule of law. It was alleged that Kyari was used by Hushpuppi to \u201cteach\u201d Chibuzor \u201ca lesson of his life\u201d. Chibuzor had allegedly badmouthed Hushpuppi before a Qatari victim whom they were about to dupe $1.1 million. The alleged phone exchanges between Hushpuppi and Kyari were quite worrisome and scary. Let\u2019s just say the \u201cSuper Cop\u201d was not smelling of roses at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, is there any code of conduct for our police officers on their personal relationships and the boundary lines? In his rebuttal, Kyari explained that Hushpuppi saw some of his native clothes and caps on his social media page and said he liked them. So, he \u201cwas connected\u201d to the seller, Kyari revealed, and the clothes and caps \u201cwere brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office\u201d. Can you imagine a tailor sending personal clothes to the FBI office for delivery to any agent, much less someone who was not in any way working at the bureau? Kyari said it with so much panache that you must weep over how low our standards are in Nigeria. It is what it is.\n\nThree, how do we check the intimacy between police officers and criminals in the community? Kyari has been very open when it comes to his relationships with known political thugs and people of questionable wealth. He has never hidden it. In fact, Kyari is a socialite. I do not know of any serious country in the world when a police officer of any cadre would be attending lavish parties and wearing \u201caso ebi\u201d. It is not just that professionalism has gone to the dogs or that he appears to be bigger than the police institution that employs him. Those are serious issues, but of particular concern is the potential conflict of interest when a police officer is in bed with dubious characters.\n\nFour, the FBI has not paraded a single suspect to be interviewed by the media. The agency gathered all its facts from the investigations, did forensic analysis and headed for the courts to kick-start the prosecution process. In Nigeria, the so-called suspects will be paraded before the media where they will make plenty \u201cconfessions\u201d and that would be the end of the matter. The all-time low has to be the case of the murder of Usifo Ataga, the CEO of Super TV. After police made an open show of the confession of Chidinma Ojukwu, who said she was the killer, she later granted an \u201cexclusive\u201d interview from custody to retract her confessions. We are just a collection of clowns in this country.\n\nFive, on reading the court deposition by Andrew John Innocenti, the FBI special agent that led the investigation, I was ashamed all over again for the Nigerian security agencies. You could see a professional job by the FBI. Painstaking investigation, intelligent analysis and lucid presentation of the facts. I tell people that if the FBI comes for you, your chances of escaping conviction are next to nil. In Nigeria, the police or EFCC will first arrest and detain you for weeks before looking for evidence to take you to court. They lose cases so easily. In climes where they take themselves seriously, they first build up the evidence and prepare the indictment before knocking on your door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Nigeria is a country that learns lessons, the Kyari affair, irrespective of how it is resolved, will not go to waste. It is an opportunity to review the conduct of police officers and come up with reform initiatives to restore professionalism to the force. I understand that Nigeria is generally upside down and we should not expect the police to be insulated from the rot and the mediocrity. After all, are they not products of a rotten system? But this is a defeatist mindset. I do not accept that we are genetically bad. We are just dirty. What we need is to be cleaned up, given new clothes and re-programmed to stay clean. At least one institution can lead the way and show what is possible.\n\nIn a conversation I had with President Muhammadu Buhari two years ago, he said something that gets me thinking anytime I am frustrated with the Nigerian system. \u201cIf the judiciary and police live up to expectations, Nigeria will get better. In fact, the job of the president will be easy,\u201d he said. While I largely agree with him, I would not say he has done much to reform those institutions. We may argue that the judiciary is independent and separation of powers in a presidential system should be respected, but what excuse can the president make about the police? Reforming the police to become more professional is not impossible. It is about determination. It can be a legacy for him.\n\nIn the wake of the Kyari affair, we need to pay more attention to ethics in public life. There is a reason why judges, police officers and other public officers are expected to have limited social lives. The risk involved in mixing with the wrong crowd is one; the need to always appear impartial to potentially contending parties is another. While an argument can be made that socialising can be a source of intelligence gathering or gaining better understanding, doing so without cover, as Kyari was doing, not only creates a moral muddle but also puts lives of prized state assets at risk. Why was he never called to order by his bosses? Nigeria could have been saved this global embarrassment.\n\nThe Nigerian government should now be working seriously to tackle the matters arising. How can police officers become more professional? How can we curtail the menace of using the police to settle personal scores? How can we address the agelong issue of torture, which is probably a carryover from military regimes when security agencies operated with impunity? How can police stop parading suspects before the media? How can police officers be held personally liable for misconducts and misdemeanours such as bribery, collusion with criminals, torture, extra-judicial killings, breaking traffic rules and misuse of siren and firearms? This is not rocket science, I think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nBUHARI IN THE UK\n\nSome people are never tired of spreading fake news. It is part of their daily chores. In July, after President Buhari moved his medical trip to the UK by one month, Nnamdi Kanu, the IPOB leader, was \u201cintercepted\u201d in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria. He had jumped bail in 2017. Some of the people spreading misinformation on WhatsApp said Buhari cancelled his trip because he was under a travel ban for \u201cabducting\u201d Kanu, a UK citizen. Really? Buhari has now travelled to the UK and even held bilateral talks with the prime minister \u2014 while Kanu remains in detention in Nigeria. And some of those circulating the fake news signed off their broadcasts as \u201cdoctor\u201d or \u201cprof\u201d. Deluded.\n\nIGBOHO IN PRISON\n\nSupporters of Sunday Igboho, the Nnamdi Kanu wannabe, pulled their own stunt when the brave Yoruba warrior was caught in the Republic of Benin on his way to Germany \u2014 allegedly to seek asylum on a suspicious passport. In no time, news started flying round that Benin had released him and he was now on his way to asylum. They even used an old picture of him inside an aircraft to back up their fable. Many people fell for it. I am currently involved in a research on how misinformation is generated and why some people are predisposed to falling for it. This is a good case study for me. It now seems Igboho will spend some time in Benin prisons, even if not deported to Nigeria. Pity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPC IN A FIX\n\nThe APC may have set itself up for a spectacular judicial quandary with the apparently illegal position being held by Mallam Mai Buni as the de facto party chairman. Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution says: \u201cThe Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\u201d There is yet no judicial pronouncement on this but if the feelers from the Supreme Court decision in the Ondo election petition are to serve as a guide, some things done by the Buni-led leadership may become null. I think it is time for Buni to go back to govern his state, even though the APC thing seems too sweet for him to let go of. Amusing.\n\nNAIRA IN TROUBLE\n\nOn Tuesday, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced that it would no longer sell FX to bureaux de change (BDCs). The bank was selling $20,000 to each of the 5,500 BDCs every week \u2014 about $5.7 billion a year. While the BDCs were getting FX from CBN at N393/$, they were selling on the streets for N500/$ \u2014 instead of the \u201crecommended\u201d N400.

          "text": "Mallam Abba Alhaji Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police widely celebrated as \u201cSuper Cop\u201d, dotes on limelight like an ant on sugar. But the celebrity cop may be seeing the dying days of his super stardom with his stinging indictment in the US. The principal character in the case is the self-confessed Nigerian inter-continental scam artist, Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, best known as Hushpuppi. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has secured a warrant of arrest to pick up Kyari, who has denied all allegations \u2014 notably the one that he, for a fee, helped Hushpuppi arrest, detain and torture one Vincent Chibuzor, said to be Hushpuppi\u2019s co-fraudster who had snitched on him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHushpuppi, who \u2014 like Kyari \u2014 is an indigene of Instagram, was arrested in Dubai in June 2020 over allegations of hacking, impersonation, scamming, banking fraud and identity theft. Eleven of his associates were also picked up. They were extradited to the US. Hushpuppi has already pleaded guilty to money laundering charges, which means he may spend up to 20 years behind bars. But the real shock for me, and I guess many Nigerians, is the extent of the alleged involvement of Kyari in the network of fraudsters. He has denied the allegations, mumbling something under his breath about native clothes and caps. Police authorities in Nigeria say they will do an \u201cinternal review\u201d.\n\nI may here confess that I used to be a fan of Kyari. About 12 years ago, a senior friend had narrated to me how his car was stolen somewhere in Yaba, Lagos state. Kyari led the team of police officers that eventually recovered the car and arrested the suspects. I started hearing good things about the officer, and I was not surprised when he eventually got double promotion. He began to hold sensitive positions and was delivering results, as far as my eyes could see. I was happy. Everybody who knows me very well can testify that I am ever guilty of always looking for Nigerian heroes and role models to celebrate in the midst of the bad news that always surrounds us. Kyari fitted the bill.\n\nI never celebrated him in my writings, but I used word of mouth to speak good things about him, even though we have never met or spoken or had any contact whatsoever. My opinion of him was based on what people I respect were saying. But I was very uncomfortable with his celebrity lifestyle. A police officer, or any law enforcement officer, should always be discreet and remain as faceless as possible. To start with, you are going after criminals. You can easily be the target of gangs who may want to harm you. Discretion is vital. My discomfort turned to disgust when I started hearing about the activities of his boys and how they were living large. Another Nigerian hope betrayed, oh dear!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if we are to be candid, it is because things are so weird and warped in Nigeria that we would be celebrating police officers for arresting criminals. What else is their job? Is it to be blaring siren all over the place? To be carrying suitcases for politicians and their girlfriends? To be speeding recklessly on the road, driving against traffic and parking in places clearly marked \u201cNo Parking\u201d? To be drinking gin and playing \u201cBaba Ijebu\u201d at 8am as those ones on Kaffi Street, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, do every day? To be waylaying and extorting motorists? I must regret that we celebrate mediocrity too much in this country and that is why many of us cannot cultivate or understand excellence.\n\nYou cannot really blame me, I would plead. In a country where it is alleged that police officers randomly arrest sex workers and rape them as part of \u201cfringe benefits\u201d, that police officers give weapons to robbers, that you go to report murder at the police station and they demand for money to do investigation, you cannot but celebrate the Kyaris that come along your way once in a Blue Moon. That is a rare commodity in the police force. I have to restrain myself from commenting on the specific allegations against Kyari before he exercises his right to defend himself, but some of us already have enough knowledge of the policing system to come to some reasoned conclusions.\n\nWithout prejudice to the police investigation, the right of Kyari to clear his name, and the actual resolution of the US case, I want to make the following preliminary and general observations. One, the way Nigerians use the police to settle personal scores is something we have to address in order to stop urinating on the rule of law. It was alleged that Kyari was used by Hushpuppi to \u201cteach\u201d Chibuzor \u201ca lesson of his life\u201d. Chibuzor had allegedly badmouthed Hushpuppi before a Qatari victim whom they were about to dupe $1.1 million. The alleged phone exchanges between Hushpuppi and Kyari were quite worrisome and scary. Let\u2019s just say the \u201cSuper Cop\u201d was not smelling of roses at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, is there any code of conduct for our police officers on their personal relationships and the boundary lines? In his rebuttal, Kyari explained that Hushpuppi saw some of his native clothes and caps on his social media page and said he liked them. So, he \u201cwas connected\u201d to the seller, Kyari revealed, and the clothes and caps \u201cwere brought to our office and he sent somebody to collect them in our office\u201d. Can you imagine a tailor sending personal clothes to the FBI office for delivery to any agent, much less someone who was not in any way working at the bureau? Kyari said it with so much panache that you must weep over how low our standards are in Nigeria. It is what it is.\n\nThree, how do we check the intimacy between police officers and criminals in the community? Kyari has been very open when it comes to his relationships with known political thugs and people of questionable wealth. He has never hidden it. In fact, Kyari is a socialite. I do not know of any serious country in the world when a police officer of any cadre would be attending lavish parties and wearing \u201caso ebi\u201d. It is not just that professionalism has gone to the dogs or that he appears to be bigger than the police institution that employs him.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s public debt has been on the rise. Despite securing debt relief during the Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration, successive governments have continued on a borrowing spree \u2014 the federal government\u2019s component of the public debt surging 86.8 percent to N26.9 trillion in the last 21 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has raised concerns among Nigerians on the debt sustainability of the country amid dwindling revenue to meet the debt obligations to creditors.\n\nWithin two weeks, the senate approved three different loan requests by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, the upper chamber approved a loan request of N2.343 trillion, approximately $6 billion and another $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefending one of the loan requests, the Debt Management Office (DMO) said it is part of a borrowing plan for the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cThe proposed new capital raising is the new external borrowing provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act to part finance the deficit in the budget. In other words, the new capital raising has already been approved in the budgetary process by the executive and legislative arms of government,\u201d the DMO had said in a statement.\n\nAs of March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt has hit N33.1 trillion ($87.24 billion) \u2014 an accumulation of borrowings from successive governments, of which most were borrowed since the return to democratic rule in 1999.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe overall public debt is the total debt accrued by federal, states, and the FCT from local and international lenders.\n\nOf the N33.1 trillion, the federal government alone borrowed N26.91 trillion \u2014 this includes the FGN bonds, Sukuk, green bonds and Euro bonds.\n\nFinally, after weeks of data aggregation, number crunching, dissecting and analyses of freedom of information (FOI) response from the Debt Management Office (DMO), TheCable presents findings that highlight how Nigeria\u2019s aggressive borrowing defies its fiscal responsibility laws.\n\nThe analyses also include data from the DMO, National Bureau of Statistical (NBS), and fiscal papers from the Budget Office of the Federation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFG DEBT CLIMBED 86.8% TO N26.9 TRILLION IN 21 YEARS\n\nData from the DMO seen by TheCable showed that federal government borrowings (local and foreign debt) climbed from N3.55 trillion in 1999 to N26.91 trillion at the end of March 2021 (the country\u2019s latest official figure).\n\nThis represents an 86.8 percent increase in 21 years, comprising the administrations of Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan, and the current Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHOW MUCH BUHARI BORROWED IN 6 YEARS\n\nThe Budget Office\u2019s medium-term expenditure framework and fiscal strategy paper from 2015 showed that the Buhari-led administration incurred N7.63 trillion in domestic debt from June 2015 to December 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn external borrowings, President Buhari increased debt from $7.3 billion in 2015 to $28.57 billion as of December 2020. This means that the president incurred $21.27 billion on foreign loans to the country\u2019s debt portfolio.\n\nThe country\u2019s exchange rate moved from N197 to a dollar in 2015 to N381 at the end of December 2020.\n\nAnalysis of consolidated debt showed that the external debt increased by 291.37 percent while domestic debt grew by 86.31 percent in the last six years of the Buhari government.\n\nOverall, the Buhari-led government has had an accumulated debt of N17.06 trillion as of March 2021, using the N381 exchange rate. This represents a 173.2 percent increase from when he was elected president in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEBT PROFILE UNDER JONATHAN\u2019S ADMINISTRATION\n\nAt the beginning of former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s tenure in 2011, the federal government had an accumulated debt of N6.17 trillion.\n\nAnalysis of the debt figure showed that local debt amounted to N5.62 trillion while foreign debt stood at $3.5 billion (about N548.65 billion, using the exchange rate of N156.7/$1).\n\nBy the end of 2015, the foreign debt component hit $7.3 billion, while domestic debt increased by N8.4 trillion. The country\u2019s exchange rate also stood at N197/$1.\n\nOverall, the federal government component of the total public debt increased from N6.17 trillion in 2011 to N9.8 trillion in 2015, representing an increase of N4.18 trillion or 74.37 percent.\n\nYAR\u2019ADUA/JONATHAN\u2019S BORROWINGS\n\nUnder the Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua/Goodluck Jonathan-led government between 2007 and 2011, domestic debt of the federal government moved from N2.17 trillion to N5.62 trillion. The foreign component of the debt also increased from $2.11 billion to $3.5 billion within the period.\n\nThe country\u2019s exchange rate also moved from N116.8/$1 to N156.7/$1.\n\nThe combined debt profile increased from N2.42 trillion to N6.17 trillion in four years, representing a 155 percent jump.\n\nOf the debt figure, Jonathan completed the tenure from May 2010 to May 2011 after the death of Yar\u2019Adua. The period saw a surge in the federal government\u2019s debt from N4.94 trillion to N6.17 trillion. This represents a 37.4 percent increase in one year.\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO\u2019S TENURE\n\nDuring the tenure of former president Olusegun Obasanjo, the debt level of the federal government reduced from N3.55 trillion in 1999 to N2.42 trillion at the end of 2007.\n\nThe 8-year term of Obasanjo resulted in a dip in FG\u2019s local and foreign debt level, representing a 32 percent decline.\n\nThe country\u2019s exchange rate was between N98.02 to N116.8 to a dollar during the tenure.\n\nAnalysis of the figures showed that external debt decreased from $28.04 billion by 1999 to $2.11 billion at the end of 2007. However, the domestic component increased from N798 billion to N2.17 trillion within the same period.\n\nThe huge decline in foreign debt was a result of the substantial reduction following the pay-off of the outstanding debts owed to the London Clubs of Creditors in the first quarter of 2007.\n\nBUHARI, NIGERIA\u2019S BIGGEST BORROWER, VIOLATING FINANCIAL LAWS\n\nSo far, Buhari is the country\u2019s biggest borrower, increasing public debt (FG component) by more than 173 percent. Next to the Buhari government is the Yar\u2019Adua/Jonathan administration with a 155 percent surge in borrowing.\n\nThe current government violates important financial laws in the country \u2014 the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the CBN Act 2007.\n\nLast year, the government exceeded the fiscal borrowing threshold as stipulated in the fiscal act.\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, admitted to this on the grounds that COVID-19 was good enough reason to breach the act.\n\nThe fiscal responsibility law provides a limit of three percent debt threshold for sustainability, but the president can \u201cexceed the ceiling if there is a clear and present threat to national security or sovereignty of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, the country\u2019s budget deficit was at about four percent of GDP, clearly breaking the law.\n\nOn overdraft, section 38, sub-section 1 and 2, of the CBN Act, said, \u201cthe Bank may grant temporary advances to the Federal Government in respect of temporary deficiency of budget revenue\u201d and \u201cthe total amount of such advances outstanding shall not at any time exceed 5 percent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nBy the end of 2020, CBN overdrafts to the Buhari government exceeded the limit by 69 percent of the revenue generated in 2019 \u2013 in a blatant violation of the apex bank rules. The government\u2019s revenue in the year was N4.1 trillion, and overdraft stood at N2.9 trillion.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s borrowing limit as a percent of GDP stood at 34.8 percent in 2020, well above 25 percent for the year. Earlier this year, the federal executive council (FEC) had strategically raised the borrowing limit to 40 percent in its Medium-term debt management strategy for Nigeria for the period 2020-2023.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP is lower than those of its peers, its debt-to-revenue is too low to sustain the country. Of every N100 government makes in revenue, N97 now goes to debt servicing.\n\nIn the last four administrations, only Obasanjo\u2019s team reduced public debt; his government recorded a 32 percent decline with the London Club agreement.\n\nINCREASING PUBLIC DEBT WORRYING\n\nWhile borrowing is required to support the economy, sustainability transparency and sustainable repayment plan are crucial.\n\nFemi Oke, an economist, said Nigeria\u2019s soaring high debt profile is not good for the country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government borrows in the worst possible way and in a very outdated manner. This causes a backlash to the government. Because Nigeria\u2019s debts are not linked to any assets, we just go to the treasury bill market and borrow, at any rate, that anybody wants to give you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are many other countries who borrow more than what Nigeria is borrowing and don\u2019t have any problem paying back. They borrow intelligently and efficiently, in a way that their debts service themselves.\n\n\u201cA more efficient way of borrowing is for the Federal Government to migrate all the debts to asset-linked debts. This means structuring the borrowing transaction like investments. There must be an underlying asset to which borrowers can use to recover the principal they gave the country plus profit.\u201d\n\nVahyala Kwaga, senior researcher and policy analyst at BudgIT, said the level of borrowing \u2013 specifically in 2021- is the highest it has been in the last six years.\n\n\u201cThe government is borrowing more, spending more and earning less revenue. For context, the government budgeted about N5.37 trillion in revenue in 2020 but only earned a total of N3.42 trillion,\u201d Kwaga said.\n\n\u201cThere is also no commensurate rise in revenue to counteract the continuing rise in debt servicing. A casual look at the debt servicing level from 2015 to 2020 shows that the level has steadily increased since then.\n\n\u201cThese amounts include debt servicing on interests for \u2018ways and means\u2019 and \u2018sinking fund to retire maturing Loans.\u2019\u201d\n\nNIGERIA\u2019S ACTUAL DEBT COULD BE 48.7TRN\n\nWilson Erumebor, a senior economist at Nigerian Economic Summit Group, said Nigeria is a case where expenditure keeps rising, revenue not improving as expected, creating a wide fiscal deficit that is majorly financed by borrowing.\n\n\u201cWhile borrowing is required to support the economy, especially given the impact of the pandemic, what we need to be concerned about is how sustainable Nigeria\u2019s debt position is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDebt has risen N33.1 trillion as of March 2021, an increase of 162.7% in the space of about five years.\n\n\u201cWhen we include AMCON\u2019s liabilities and CBN\u2019s ways and means, debt could amount to about N48.7 trillion, which is around 32 percent of GDP.\n\n\u201cDebt to GDP may seem quite low at 32 percent, we must understand that debt is serviced with revenues, so if debt servicing is increasing and revenue is not performing, then we have a problem.\u201d\n\nErumebor suggests that the federal government must improve efficiency, transparency, blocking leakages, and deliver value on public projects, despite limited resources.\n\n\u201cWe must work towards unlocking many sectors and many areas where the country can earn revenue.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Nigeria\u2019s low debt-to-GDP ratio is highly vulnerable to shocks.\n\n\u201cDespite Nigeria\u2019s relatively low debt level, liquidity-based indicators-driven by low revenue mobilisation-remain concerning, with the interest bill representing a high share of government revenue (but low relative to GDP),\u201d IMF said in its country\u2019s report for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cStress scenarios confirm the vulnerability of public debt to a low growth/wide primary deficit scenario.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s public debt has been on the rise. Despite securing debt relief during the Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration, successive governments have continued on a borrowing spree \u2014 the federal government\u2019s component of the public debt surging 86.8 percent to N26.9 trillion in the last 21 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has raised concerns among Nigerians on the debt sustainability of the country amid dwindling revenue to meet the debt obligations to creditors.\n\nWithin two weeks, the senate approved three different loan requests by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, the upper chamber approved a loan request of N2.343 trillion, approximately $6 billion and another $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefending one of the loan requests, the Debt Management Office (DMO) said it is part of a borrowing plan for the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cThe proposed new capital raising is the new external borrowing provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act to part finance the deficit in the budget. In other words, the new capital raising has already been approved in the budgetary process by the executive and legislative arms of government,\u201d the DMO had said in a statement.\n\nAs of March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt has hit N33.1 trillion ($87.24 billion) \u2014 an accumulation of borrowings from successive governments, of which most were borrowed since the return to democratic rule in 1999.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe overall public debt is the total debt accrued by federal, states, and the FCT from local and international lenders.\n\nOf the N33.1 trillion, the federal government alone borrowed N26.91 trillion \u2014 this includes the FGN bonds, Sukuk, green bonds and Euro bonds.\n\nFinally, after weeks of data aggregation, number crunching, dissecting and analyses of freedom of information (FOI) response from the Debt Management Office (DMO), TheCable presents findings that highlight how Nigeria\u2019s aggressive borrowing defies its fiscal responsibility laws.\n\nThe analyses also include data from the DMO, National Bureau of Statistical (NBS), and fiscal papers from the Budget Office of the Federation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFG DEBT CLIMBED 86.8% TO N26.9 TRILLION IN 21 YEARS\n\nData from the DMO seen by TheCable showed that federal government borrowings (local and foreign debt) climbed from N3.55 trillion in 1999 to N26.91 trillion at the end of March 2021 (the country\u2019s latest official figure).\n\nThis represents an 86.8 percent increase in 21 years, comprising the administrations of Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan, and the current Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHOW MUCH BUHARI BORROWED IN 6 YEARS\n\nThe Budget Office\u2019s medium-term expenditure framework and fiscal strategy paper from 2015 showed that the Buhari-led administration incurred N7.63 trillion in domestic debt from June 2015 to December 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn external borrowings, President Buhari increased debt from $7.3 billion in 2015 to $28.57 billion as of December 2020. This means that the president incurred $21.27 billion on foreign loans to the country\u2019s debt portfolio.\n\nThe country\u2019s exchange rate moved from N197 to a dollar in 2015 to N381 at the end of December 2020.\n\nAnalysis of consolidated debt showed that the external debt increased by 291.37 percent while domestic debt grew by 86.31 percent in the last six years of the Buhari government.\n\nOverall, the Buhari-led government has had an accumulated debt of N17.06 trillion as of March 2021, using the N381 exchange rate. This represents a 173.2 percent increase from when he was elected president in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEBT PROFILE UNDER JONATHAN\u2019S ADMINISTRATION\n\nAt the beginning of former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s tenure in 2011, the federal government had an accumulated debt of N6.17 trillion.\n\nAnalysis of the debt figure showed that local debt amounted to N5.62 trillion while foreign debt stood at $3.5 billion (about N548.65 billion, using the exchange rate of N156.7/$1).\n\nBy the end of 2015, the foreign debt component hit $7.3 billion, while domestic debt increased by N8.4 trillion. The country\u2019s exchange rate also stood at N197/$1.\n\nOverall, the federal government component of the total public debt increased from N6.17 trillion in 2011 to N9.8 trillion in 2015, representing an increase of N4.18 trillion or 74.37 percent.\n\nYAR\u2019ADUA/JONATHAN\u2019S BORROWINGS\n\nUnder the Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua/Goodluck Jonathan-led government between 2007 and 2011, domestic debt of the federal government moved from N2.17 trillion to N5.62 trillion. The foreign component of the debt also increased from $2.11 billion to $3.5 billion within the period.\n\nThe country\u2019s exchange rate also moved from N116.8/$1 to N156.7/$1.\n\nThe combined debt profile increased from N2.42 trillion to N6.17 trillion in four years, representing a 155 percent jump.\n\nOf the debt figure, Jonathan completed the tenure from May 2010 to May 2011 after the death of Yar\u2019Adua. The period saw a surge in the federal government\u2019s debt from N4.94 trillion to N6.17 trillion. This represents a 37.4 percent increase in one year.\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO\u2019S TENURE\n\nDuring the tenure of former president Olusegun Obasanjo, the debt level of the federal government reduced from N3.55 trillion in 1999 to N2.42 trillion at the end of 2007.\n\nThe 8-year term of Obasanjo resulted in a dip in FG\u2019s local and foreign debt level, representing a 32 percent decline.\n\nThe country\u2019s exchange rate was between N98.02 to N116.8 to a dollar during the tenure.\n\nAnalysis of the figures showed that external debt decreased from $28.04 billion by 1999 to $2.11 billion at the end of 2007. However, the domestic component increased from N798 billion to N2.17 trillion within the same period.\n\nThe huge decline in foreign debt was a result of the substantial reduction following the pay-off of the outstanding debts owed to the London Clubs of Creditors in the first quarter of 2007.\n\nBUHARI, NIGERIA\u2019S BIGGEST BORROWER, VIOLATING FINANCIAL LAWS\n\nSo far, Buhari is the country\u2019s biggest borrower, increasing public debt (FG component) by more than 173 percent.

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Nigeria\u2019s central bank is banning forex sales to money changers",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nManaging Director of Evans Brothers Nigeria Publishers Limited, Mr. Lukman Dauda, has called on booksellers in the country to work together with a view to tackling the current trend of publishers selling books directly to end users, which according to him, has adversely affected book trade.\n\nMr. Lukman who made the call while presenting the print edition of the Nigerian Booksellers Directory 2021 at the Nigerian International Book Fair in Lagos on Thursday, regretted that with the advent of private schools, publishers now enter into deals directly with schools as opposed to reaching them through booksellers as was originally the case.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWith the advent of private schools, booksellers have been sidelined. Publishers now go directly to schools and other end users. This has affected the book trade.\n\n\u201cBooksellers should try to put a stop to it. We should speak with one voice and insist on the original arrangement of publishers coming to booksellers and booksellers going to schools.\u201d\n\nWhile calling on publishers to end the practice of selling to end users and return to the original of pattern of reaching end users through booksellers, Dauda equally tasked booksellers to do more to encourage publishers by always remitting funds to them as at when due.\n\nHe emphasised that publishing is a capital intensive venture, and when booksellers fail to remit funds to publishers, it adversely affects their business.\n\nHe said, \u201cBooksellers should also pity publishers by remitting proceeds from sales to publishers. Sellers and publishers are partners and it should remain so.\u201d\n\nMr. Dauda also decried the prevalence of book piracy in the country, noting that it has remained a huge challenge to the sector.\n\nHe called on the Booksellers Association of Nigeria (BAN) to develop a mechanism for punishing booksellers who sell pirated books as a way of curbing the menace.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Mr. Dare Oluwatuyi, President of Booksellers Association of Nigeria, who alongside Mr. Richard Mammah, compiled the Directory, noted that its publication was informed by the need to know those involved in book selling in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen we assumed the leadership of the Booksellers in Nigeria two years ago, a challenge that we faced was to not only how to go out there to know more and more of our members and bring them into the fold, but to also begin to place our finger on what the statistics were concerning the overall size and worth of the composite bookselling complex in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOluwatuyi described the Directory as \u201cAn important piece of documentation. Given its potential for aggregation, it stood out as one way of beginning to address these issues. And so for us therefore, it soon became one of the first things to do. And I am glad that we have it to present to you today.\u201d\n\nThe book reviewer, Dr. Olayinka Oyegbile, journalism, media and culture studies expert, in his review, noted that the Directory answers the question as to where to go and buy books to avoid pirates.\n\nHe said the compilers did a commendable job, given the paucity of data in the country. According to him, \u201cBAN has done a great service to the book industry. The directory has given information on booksellers and Nigerians now know where to and buy non pirated books.\n\n\u201cThe directory should be made available to all educational institutions and libraries, because it has information.\u201d\n\nHe praised the Directory for being well-written, noting that he could not find any grammatical or typographical error in it, but noted that it\u2019s not comprehensive enough and can be improved upon.\n\nChairman of the occasion, Mr. Lanre Damion Adesuyi, CEO of Havilah Group, in his address, said the 2021 Directory stands out out as a very significant improvement over all previous publications.\n\n\u201cThis quality of detailed publication though long overdue, has come at the most auspicious time in the history of the book trade in Nigeria, being an invaluable resource publication to give booksellers a strategic sense of belonging because of their roles in the book value chain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough this is not an occasion to trace the history of bookselling in Nigeria, it is apt to state that the success of actors in this segment of the book chain is anchored on the tenacity of Booksellers who against all odds remain dogged to keep the book alive and meet the yearnings of the reading public for knowledge, which is crucial for national development. Obviously, without the booksellers littered in the nooks and crannies of our vast country, it would have been somehow impossible to get the books.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. John Asein, Director General of Nigeria Copyright Commission, while commending BAN and Mr. Oluwatuyi for a job well-done, noted that booksellers needed to do more.\n\nHe called on BAN to register with the NIPC and develop an action plan to use the directory to make life unbearable for pirates in the country.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe members of the Osun State National Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Ward Congress have applauded the peaceful conduct of the exercise in the entire State.\n\nThe delegates also extolled members of the ruling party for their high level of compliance towards ensuring smooth, free, fair, credible and acceptable congress across the 332 wards in the state.\n\nThis is even as the APC loyalists and supporters who participated in the process across wards in the State expressed satisfaction at the adoption of consensus mode by the party leadership.\n\nRecall that members of the Committee after their arrival in Osun on Friday evening, during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting, announced their readiness to conduct a credible and transparent Congress in the State.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after the tour to some of the wards in the State, the Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, expressed delight at the way and manner the members of the party conducted themselves.\n\nElegbeleye, who supervised the Congress exercise in all the wards visited, said it was worthy of note that the entire process had been seen, observed and adjudged to be peaceful, orderly and in line with the party\u2019s principles and guidelines.\n\nHe noted that the reports gathered so far had reflected the peaceful conduct of the members of the party as demonstrated to elect new party\u2019s officers.\n\n\u201cSo far so good, the Congress has been conducted in a free, fair and credible atmosphere. The wards visited so far have been very peaceful as members of the party conducted themselves in a peaceful manner to elect their new officers across the registered 332 wards in the State.\n\n\u201cWe were able to see the members agreeing on who will oversee the affairs of the party as new executive officers in all the wards we have visited.\n\n\u201cThough the party agreed on consensus for the conduct of the Congress, in case there is any disagreement, then, they will vote. Anywhere the members feel they don\u2019t like a particular candidate, then they can vote.\n\n\u201cBut in a situation where for instance we have about a hundred members and eighty-five of them agreed on a particular candidate and fifteen disagreed, there is nothing to vote about. One must have known that the majority have their way,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile fielding questions from journalists during the tour of the Committee to Iragbiji, the country home of the State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, the governor lauded the members of the party for turning out in large numbers to elect new officers of the party at wards level.\n\nOyetola also extolled the peaceful conduct of the exercise across the 332 wards in the State.\n\n\u201cWell, you have seen things for yourselves and thank God it is been very peaceful. Members of the party are here in their large numbers, just as the Congress has been done in line with the directive of the National Secretariat of the party.\n\n\u201cIt has been peaceful all through as we all agreed to use the principle of consensus to elect those that will be overseeing the affairs of the party in their various wards.\n\n\u201cI am glad the way everything has been going so far. As you can see that people are very happy here in my ward. It can\u2019t be otherwise because we had a consensus agreement across the nine federal constituencies in the State and I am glad that members of the party have been allowed to exercise their rights in this regard.\n\n\u201cI must appreciate those who have contributed to the success of the conduct, particularly members of the press who have been very supportive,\u201d Oyetola added.\n\nEarlier, the Osun Caretaker Chairman of the party, Prince Gboyega Famodun, hailed the party members for adhering to and complying with consensus mode.\n\nAccording to him, the report so far across the State has indicated that the Congress has been very peaceful and orderly as it has affirmed the decision of the party to consider the consensus.\n\nThe Committee members visited Ward 04, the ward of the former Interim National Chairman of APC, Chief Adebisi Akande in Ila-Orangun, Ila Local Government Area; Ward 04, Igbajo, Boluwaduro Local Government; Ward 01, Iragbiji, Boripe Local Government among others.",

Hush then provides Kyari with Chibuzor\u2019s phone numbers which was used to trace and pick him up.\n\n9.Upon picking and locking Chibuzor up, Kyari sent pictures of Chibuzor in police custody to Hush and Hush confirms the detainee was indeed Chibuzor. Hush then tells Kyari he wants Chibuzor beaten blue black and gone for a very long time. Kyari agreed to Hush wishes.\n\n10.Kyari then provided a Zenith bank account details to Hush where payments for the job and the boys would be made and an estimated N8m was made.\n\n11.Chibuzor\u2019s girlfriend runs around to gather money to secure his release and even contacted Hush to help provide funds to bail Chibuzor from custody. Hush sent her 100k and then contacted Kyari telling him what happened and reiterating\u2026 his wishes to Kyari to ensure Chibuzor is not released.\n\n12.After a while in custody, Chibuzor got really sick and seemed to have contacted a disease in the cell was taken to a hospital for treatment, Kyari sent pictures of a sick and diseased Chibuzor to Hush. Hush said he sees Chibuzor is really sick but doesn\u2019t pity him for what he has done. They both ended that conversation and agreed to release Chibuzor.\n\n13.Back to the businessperson, he has noticed some irregularities in his dealings with Juma as Juma was his first contact and who brought Hush into play and realized Juma was scamming him. Hush who is still a supposed Malik a US based banker then contacts the businessperson that he could solve the issues but might have to pay another $180k.\n\n14.The businessperson made this payments in 2 transactions of $100k and $80k. Hush didn\u2019t tell Juma about this dealings with the businessperson.\n\n15.The businessperson eventually realizes he is been defrauded and challenges Hush, alleging Hush and Juma are part of the same team and stopped all comms with Hush.\n\n16.Other people involved in this case mentioned are one BOLATITO and another MORAYO. These people who provided US based bank accounts for the businessperson to transfer to, who then laundered the money to Hush via various means.\n\n17.Among these means include the purchase and delivery of a Richard Mille watch of about $250k which Bolatito received from the seller and delivered to Morayo who then sent it to Hush in Dubai.\n\n18.Hush also used proceeds of his deal to acquire citizenship and passport of St. Kitts. Hush used a fake Nigerian wedding certificate to a St. Kitts citizen and bribed some people to acquire this citizenship.",

          "text": "The Police Service Commission has indicated that it may fire Abba Kyari, the embattled Deputy Commissioner of Police and Commander of the Inspector-General of Police\u2019s Intelligence Response and Monitoring Team, who was indicted by the FBI for alleged involvement in a $1.1 million online fraud.\n\nThe PSC has the authority to decide Kyari\u2019s fate if he was found guilty of the claims, according to the commission.\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal complaint lodged at the United States District Court in California had listed Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, and Kyari among six suspects indicted in the international fraud conspiracy.\n\nThe other suspects include AbdulRahman Juma (Abdul); Vincent Kelly Chibuzo (Kelly); Rukayat Motunrayo Fashola (Morayo); and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka (Bolamide).\n\nOn Wednesday, however, an unsealed 69-page court document showed that he had been under investigation by the FBI for his alleged link to Hushpuppi, who had pleaded guilty to fraud.\n\nSpeaking to Punch on Friday, the Commissioner in charge of Media on the board of the Police Service Commission, Mr Austin Braimoh, said the PSC would not be bound by the IG\u2019s review of the allegations against Kyari, noting that the commission would carry out further probe on whatever findings the police authorities made on Kyari.\n\nBraimoh stated that the commission\u2019s findings would determine Kyari\u2019s future in the police force.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe commission won\u2019t say anything until we get the official report. We are the final decision-maker on his fate as a police officer. Everything concerning his indictment can be investigated and the criminal aspect of it can be sent to the law court but on the official aspect concerning discipline; no other body has power to do anything to him as a police officer, it is only the commission that has such powers.\n\n\u201cSo, the commission is awaiting the full report of investigation and his indictment and we will treat it officially; we would apply the law. The law will determine the various punishments that we can award against him. He can be dismissed depending on the gravity of the offence; we can demote him, reduce his rank; we can suspend him.\n\n\u201cMany things are laid out before us pertaining to various offences and after that, the criminal aspect would be referred to the court for prosecution. It depends on how the report is coming; whether it is coming to us directly for us to extricate the criminal aspect and treat it or they want to treat it and refer the official one to us to discipline him.\u201d\n\nAsked if the police could be trusted to carry out a thorough, unbiased investigation, the commissioner disclosed that the PSC investigation department will subject the findings of the police review to further investigations.\n\nGiving an insight into the disciplinary process the embattled DCP would go through, Braimoh explained that Kyari would be queried after which he would be interrogated by the Force Disciplinary Committee.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe don\u2019t always believe the police should investigate the police (personnel) except through the commission. But the important thing is that whatever thing they decide to do, we are not obliged to accept their investigations. So, our investigation department would still go further to get the facts.\n\n\u2018\u2019What we know they would do is that a query would be issued based on the complaints against him, he would be asked to defend himself and then, he would face what we call the Force Disciplinary Committee which would interrogate him and the report is passed to the DIG in charge and from there to the IG.\n\n\u201cThe IG would basically forward the final findings and recommendations to the commission. The commission would now carry on with their own investigation; we have to re-investigate what they have done to ensure that they comply with the rule of law and what is expected.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our lawyer would look into it, he would check the facts and if we feel there is negligence and that some things are not done, we would do a thorough job and eventually, we would have recommendations from the standing committee to the plenary for a final decision and our decision is final on his career.\u2019\u2019",

Godswill Akpabio, has appealed to indigenes of host communities at the Eleme and Onne axis of the East-West road in Rivers State, to support ongoing efforts of the government aimed at completing the road project as scheduled.\n\nThe minister made this call during his meeting with Stakeholders and Management of Reynold Construction Company, RCC in his office, on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nAkpabio noted that the Federal Government has not abandoned the road as being insinuated in some quarters, explaining that the ministry has been working with the construction company in charge of the road project and has gotten an assurance that the 338KM project will be delivered by 2022.\n\n\u201cThe road, particularly the Eleme Junction and the Onne Port junction area is in a deplorable state, noting that the road when it was first awarded in 2006, was still in very good shape and was therefore excluded from the original contract, however, 15 years after that section has gone bad.\n\n\u201cWe have had some apotheosis that has come up within the road corridor, which was not in the original plan, for instance, the Ministry of Power has built a major power Sub-Station by the Eleme junction, and a lot of other structures have also come on board while a section of the bridge at Aleto also collapsed due to erosion at the embayment of the bridge and due to these unforeseen circumstances a section of the road was to be redesigned to preserve the sub-station which is germane to the sustenance of economic activities within the region,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added that the government has released N2.5bn to RCC as part of outstanding payment and also made available N1.17bn to enable the payment of compensation to property owners affected in the road construction.\n\nThe minister further disclosed that due to the volume of traffic on the road, it has become imperative that the road be expanded to six lanes, with additional flyovers. These, according to him, were not captured in the initial contract and design.\n\nIn the aspect of funding, Akpabio hinted that the ministry had to suspend funding over 300 projects to enable it to cater for the East-West road, adding that the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has also budgeted N35bn towards the completion of the road, while the Ministry of Finance has also earmarked funds to be committed to the same project.\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of RCC, Engr. Nader Yusuf noted that the main issue in the Eleme Junction is in the delay of compensation to the indigenes that have properties on that axis of the road. He advised that once relevant funds are made available, payment of compensation would commence immediately.",

          "title": "Inside the \u2018Hushpuppi\u2019 Operation That Indicted DCP Abba Kyari",
          "text": "In October 2019, a businessperson started looking for an investor who could provide a $15 million loan to build an international school in Qatar.\n\nBy November, the businessperson was on a plane to Kenya, to meet a potential facilitator \u2013 Abdulrahman Juma, a 28-year-old parading as the \u2018Chairman\u2019 and \u2018Funding Officer\u2019 of Westload Financial Solutions Limited.\n\nJuma was able to convince the businessperson to sign a contract that mandated the payment of a $225,000 consultancy fee before the loan could be disbursed.\n\nOf course, there was no loan. But the businessperson didn\u2019t know that at the time.\n\nAfter the businessperson wired a first tranche of $164,450, Juma provided a forged document showing a wire transfer of $15 million from a Barclays Bank account in the United Kingdom to the businessperson\u2019s bank account in Qatar, according to documents from the US Department of Justice seen and reviewed by Channels Television.\n\nWhen the businessperson reached out to the bank to confirm the funds, there was no $15 million. The businessperson contacted Juma, who said the businessperson had to pay another \u201cpayment of release order\u201d to release the funds.\n\nIn early December, the businessperson wired another $150,000, hoping that would be the final payment for the release of the $15 million. The businessperson was wrong.\n\nBecause the dance had just begun.\n\nEnter Hushpuppi\n\nOn December 7, 2019, Juma reached out to Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, an Instagram celebrity who took pictures with expensive cars and watches and wrote motivational captions before his July 2020 arrest in Dubai.\n\nJuma and Hushpuppi, apparently, belonged to a global fraud syndicate that has fleeced numerous individuals and organisations of millions of dollars.\n\nIn July, Hushpuppi pleaded guilty to multiple counts of money laundering before a US Federal Court and now faces up to 20 years in jail.\n\nThe December 2019 conversation, too, revolved around how they could siphon more money off the businessperson seeking a $15 million loan.\n\nHushpuppi told Juma that he would pretend to be a Bank Director \u2013 with the moniker Malik \u2013 when communicating with the businessperson. The duo agreed on profit sharing and Hushpuppi created a new Whatsapp account, using an American phone number.\n\nTexting the businessperson, Hushpuppi introduced himself as Malik, \u201cthe director of the bank responsible for crediting you the funds\u201d working with \u201cMr Rahman (Juma) from Kenya.\u201d\n\nJuma and Hushpuppi shared, with each other, screenshots of their messages with the businessperson, as the conversations progressed.\n\nTo begin to tempt the businessperson to part with more money, Hushpuppi said there was a need to open a bank account in the United States, to transfer the $15 million loan because Qatar had apparently been sanctioned by the US government.\n\nThe initial agreement was that the funds will then be credited from the US account to the businessperson\u2019s bank account in London.\n\nApparently, Hushpuppi had a \u2018white guy\u2019 from America call the businessperson to boost the legitimacy of the scheme. The businessperson \u201cis so happy\u201d, Hushpuppi reported to Juma.\n\nUsing the resources at his disposal, Hushpuppi created a fictitious business name statement (carrying the name of the businessperson\u2019s company) in the US. He then used the business name to open a bank account, in the name of the businessperson\u2019s company.\n\nHe was also able to generate a \u2018Durable Power of Attorney\u2019 form. Fraudulent, of course.\n\nOn December 20, Hushpuppi sent the account and online login of the Canoga Park Wells Fargo account to the businessperson, who must have felt, once again, that the loan was palpable.\n\nBut when the businessperson sent Hushpuppi the information for a UK bank account where the loan funds should be deposited, the latter balked.\n\nHushpuppi told the businessperson that it would not work to send funds to a \u201cpersonal account\u201d in the UK. Instead, the businessperson should open an investor\u2019s account with his own private banking service.\n\nTo open the account, Hushpuppi said, the businessperson would have to fund it with a minimum of 250,000 pounds.\n\nAt this point, the businessperson started to smell a rat. But the allure of imminent victory was too strong.\n\nOn December 23, after some back and forth between Juma and Hushpuppi, (the former apparently wasn\u2019t convinced that it was the right time to ask for more money) the businessperson agreed to open the investor\u2019s account.\n\nGame, set . . . match?\n\nAmerican money launderers\n\nTo receive and launder the proceeds of the Qatar operation, Hushpuppi relied on two other individuals living in the United States \u2013 Rukayat Fashola and Bolatito Agbabiaka.\n\nHe also used part of the loot to purchase a luxury Richard Mille watch and St. Kitts citizenship.\n\nOn December 24, Hushpuppi sent the businessperson two bank account details, one belonging to Agbabiaka, and the other to the Richard Mille watchseller.\n\nThat same day, the businessperson transferred $330,000 to the accounts and sent Hushpuppi photographs of the wire transfer confirmations.\n\nNow, the businessperson must have been agitated. \u201cCan you please let me know when I can receive the fund as agreed and promised?\u201d The businessperson said in a text to Juma after forwarding the $330,000.\n\nJuma forwarded the businessperson\u2019s messages to Hushpuppi with a note: \u201cI need your advice before I get back.\u201d\n\nHushpuppi must have smiled. He had another trick up his sleeve.\n\nThe money call\n\nOn January 4, 2020, Vincent Chibuzo, another of Hushpuppi\u2019s associates, sent the Instagram celebrity a message containing a \u201ctelephone banking\u201d number.\n\nThis will \u201cblow the client\u2019s mind,\u201d Chibuzo said in his message to Hushpuppi.\n\nThe next plan had been to create a fake Wells Fargo bank website and a fake banking automated telephone number that could deceive the businessperson that, indeed, the promised funds had been deposited into the Canoga Park Wells Fargo account Hushpuppi had opened for the Qatar business.\n\nWhen the \u201ctelephone banking\u201d information was eventually sent to the businessperson, it was so convincing that the businessperson wrote back to Hushpuppi: \u201cOMG, I can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nAfter calling the businessperson, Juma sent Hushpuppi a voice note.\n\nThe businessperson \u201ccan\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe businessperson \u201cis really excited.\u201d\n\nThe businessperson \u201cis crying tears of joy.\u201d\n\nThe businessperson \u201cis thanking me.\u201d\n\nIn response, Hushpuppi said, \u201cAre you proud of me or not? It\u2019s a perfect job, bro.\u201d\n\nThe tax plan\n\nAfter raising the businessperson\u2019s hopes, Hushpuppi reached out and claimed there was a need to pay a tax of $575,000 to have the loan cleared.\n\n\u201cSorry but this is too much,\u201d the businessperson replied.\n\nThe next day, the businessperson contacted Juma, asking him to find a way to avoid paying the $575,000 tax. Juma sent screenshots of this conversation to Hushpuppi.\n\nOn January 10, Hushpuppi and Juma discussed reducing the amount the businessperson should be asked to pay. Later, they communed on how to stop the businessperson from flying to the UK to confirm that there were funds in the purported Wells Fargo account.\n\nJuma said he had told the businessperson to keep things quiet, and to not tell anyone or ask anyone about the status of the loan.\n\nOn January 13, the businessperson agreed to pay $440,000 in taxes.\n\nThe Kyari connection\n\nThe saying that \u2018there is no honour among thieves\u2019 began to manifest among the Hushpuppi syndicate.\n\nFirst, Juma was able to secure $299,983.58 from the businessperson, perhaps as part of the tax payments. But he refused to share it with Hushpuppi because he (Juma) had not received a share from the earlier $330,000 sent by the businessperson.\n\nThen Chibuzo, who was based in Nigeria at the time, accused Hushpuppi of not paying for the work that was being done on the fake Wells Fargo website.\n\nAs a way to get back at Hushpuppi, Chibuzo contacted the businessperson directly and, claiming he was \u201ctrying to help\u201d, said Hushpuppi was a scammer.\n\nWhen Hushpuppi got wind of Chibuzo\u2019s actions, he was livid. \u201cI will deal with him,\u201d he told Juma.\n\nHushpuppi reached out to Abba Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner in the Nigeria Police Force, and sent him Chibuzo\u2019s phone number.\n\nIn one text to Chibuzo, Hushpuppi said in pidgin: \u201cI swear with my life that you will regret messing with me, you will even wish you died before my hands will touch you.\u201d\n\nNow, Hushpuppi\u2019s relationship with DCP Kyari is contested.\n\nThe police officer has said he received no payment to arrest Chibuzo and that he was only responding to a violent threat complaint raised by Hushpuppi.\n\nBut there is overwhelming evidence \u2013 including screenshots of receipts sent by Hushpuppi to Kyari \u2013 that the arrest of Chibuzo was influenced by DCP Kyari\u2019s chummy relationship with Hushpuppi and not credible intelligence. (The Nigeria police has said it is investigating the matter)\n\n\u201cPlease sir, I want to spend money to send this boy to jail; let him go for a very long time,\u201d Hushpuppi said in one text to Kyari.\n\n\u201cOk bro, I understand,\u201d Kyari texted back. \u201cI will discuss with my team who arrested him . . . we will do something about it.\u201d\n\nHushpuppi said he was ready to send money to the team, so they can deal with Chibuzo like an \u201carmed robber.\u201d Kyari said he would send the team\u2019s account details.\n\nWhen Hushpuppi said \u201cI want him to suffer for many years,\u201d Kyari responded, \u201chahahaha . . . hahahaha.\u201d\n\nChibuzo was released about a month later after contracting a skin disease in jail.\n\nA litany of doubts\n\nChibuzo\u2019s whistleblowing had apparently not deterred the businessperson. Too much money had been sunk into acquiring the $15 million loan, the businessperson must have reasoned. Too late to now throw in the towel.\n\nBut after paying Juma $299,983.58, the businessperson was beginning to doubt the Kenyan financier and turned to \u2018Malik\u2019, the Wells Fargo banker.\n\nThe businessperson told Malik \u2013 Hushpuppi \u2013 that they believed Juma had been scamming them, after spending over $1 million to acquire the loan.\n\n\u201cI know that you think I am stupid but I trust (Juma) and now I\u2019m going bankrupt,\u201d the businessperson said.\n\nEver the conman, Hushpuppi said, \u201cWow, over one million?\u201d\n\nThen he promised to help the businessperson.\n\nLater, he claimed to have spoken to his supervisor who was willing to reduce the tax amount that the businessperson would pay to $180,000. But he asked the businessperson to keep their discussions confidential, especially from Juma.\n\n\u201cTry and get the $180,000 sent before the end of the month and (Juma) will be put to shame and God will deal with him also,\u201d Hushpuppi told the businessperson.\n\nAt the same time, Hushpuppi was deflecting enquiries from Juma about what the next move to get more money from the businessperson was.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the businessperson wired the $180,000 to Hushpuppi, a bulk of it to an account provided by Agbabiaka, the alleged American co-launderer.\n\nOn March 11, the businessperson contacted Hushpuppi to ask about when she would receive the $15 million loan to build the international school. Hushpuppi claimed to have gone to the IRS to pay the tax and that his boss would be able to send the wire the next day.\n\nThe next day, Hushpuppi told the businessperson that his boss, Yousif, would contact the businessperson.\n\nThe bogus Yousif identity contacted the businessperson via Whatsapp and demanded payment for additional \u201ctransfer charges.\u201d\n\nBut the businessperson, exhausted and defeated, reached out to Hushpuppi instead.\n\n\u201cSorry Mr Malik but I\u2019m not gonna pay more and I\u2019m out of this game,\u201d the businessperson said. \u201cI\u2019ll stop all my communication with you . . . You are doing what exactly Juma did . . . I\u2019m now 100% sure that you and Juma and Yousif are all one team.\u201d",

You can recall we had a memorandum of action on March 31, 2021, and had an addendum to it on April 9, and since then, we still have had irregularities in the payment of salaries to the house officers.\n\n\u201cWe had issues with them being non-regular payment and as part of the memorandum of action, it was said that they should be captured back into the IPPS platform,\u201d he said.\n\nUyilawa added, \u201cYou are aware that we lost 19 members to COVID-19 and death in service insurance was supposed to be paid to their next of kin.\n\n\u201cThe last time we met the minister of labour and minister of health, we were told that our members are part of those to be given the insurance benefit, but we found out that their names are not even their.\u201d\n\nHe cited the inability of the Federal Government to meet the demands of the doctors as part of the reasons for the decision to go on strike.\n\nThe NARD president, however, apologised to Nigerians for the decision which he insisted was a result of the government\u2019s failure in its responsibilities.\n\nThe resolutions reached at the end of the meeting read,\n\nAfter critical appraisal of the performance of both Federal and State Governments on all the issues affecting the welfare of our members as observed above and the insincerity of government in implementing the memorandum of action after One Hundred and Thirteen (113) days, the NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite\n\nstrike action from 08.00hrs Monday 2nd August 2021. The NEC in particular demanded the immediate withdrawal of the circular removing House Officers from the scheme of service. Finally, the NEC stated unequivocally especially to the members of the public that the NARD is committed to the smooth running of the health sector; however, can only do so when our welfare is given the desired attention.\n\nThe doctors had embarked on industrial action in April, leaving many patients unattended across various government-owned hospitals in the country.\n\nThey later suspended it 10 days later following a virtual meeting with members which lasted about 15 hours on April 10.\n\nSome of the issues raised by the medical practitioners as of then included the immediate payment of all salaries owed to all house officers, including March salaries (regardless of quota system) before the end of business on March 31.\n\nThey also sought an upward review of the hazard allowance to 50 per cent of consolidated basic salaries of all health workers and payment of the outstanding COVID-19 inducement allowance, especially in state-owned-tertiary Institutions.\n\nThe doctors called for the abolishment of the exorbitant bench fees being paid by their members on outside postings in all training institutions across the country.",

          "text": "The United States imposed sanctions on the Cuban police force and two of its leaders on Friday in response to the Havana government\u2019s crackdown on protesters, and President Joe Biden promised Cuban-American leaders more actions were coming.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions, which appeared to be largely symbolic, were a reaction to \u201cactions to suppress peaceful, pro-democratic protests in Cuba that began on July 11.\u201d\n\nTargets of the sanctions are two Cuban police force leaders, as well as the Cuban interior ministry\u2019s national police force, the department said.\n\n\u201cThere will be more, unless there\u2019s some drastic change in Cuba, which I don\u2019t anticipate,\u201d Biden said during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders at the White House.\n\nHis meeting came as the politically important community calls for more support for protests here in Cuba that represent the biggest populist outpouring against the government on the Communist-run island in decades.\n\n\u201cThe United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people,\u201d said Biden.\n\nBiden said he had asked the Treasury and State departments to report back in a month on how to allow remittance payments from Americans to Cubans without the Cuban government profiting.\n\nIn addition, Biden has been working on a plan to try to provide wireless communications to Cubans and augment U.S. embassy staff in Cuba, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe protests erupted this month amid Cuba\u2019s worst economic crisis since the fall of its old Soviet Union ally and a record surge in coronavirus infections. Thousands took to the streets, angry over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties, and the authorities\u2019 handling of the pandemic.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has blamed the unrest on the United States, which in recent years has tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island. He has said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions here on Cuba\u2019s defense minister and an interior ministry special forces unit over allegations of human rights abuses in the crackdown that followed the protests, which saw hundreds of activists detained.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged more measures.\n\nParticipants in Friday\u2019s meeting included Yotuel Romero, a hip hop musician and author of \u201cPatria y Vida,\u201d a song that has become the anthem for the protesters; Ana Sofia Pelaez, founder of the Miami Freedom Project; and former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz.",
