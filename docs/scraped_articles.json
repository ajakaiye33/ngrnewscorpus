          "text": "Twelve people were crushed to death in a stampede at an Indian religious shrine in the early hours of Saturday as tens of thousands of pilgrims massed to offer prayers, officials said.\n\nThe disaster unfolded in darkness at around 3:00 am (2130 GMT) on the packed route to the Vaishno Devi shrine in Indian-administered Kashmir, visited by millions every year as one of Hinduism\u2019s most revered sites.\n\n\u201cPeople fell over each other\u2026 It was difficult to figure out whose leg or arms were tangled with whose,\u201d survivor Ravinder told AFP by phone.\n\n\u201cI helped pick up eight bodies by the time ambulances arrived after about half an hour. I feel lucky to be alive but am still shaking with memory of what I saw,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo footage showed terrified pilgrims clinging onto metal rafters to escape the rush and the blue lights of small minivan ambulances flashing in the darkness as they tried to rush to hospitals through huge crowds.\n\nOfficials sought to blame an alleged altercation between two groups of youths and a rush of people for New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cPolice and officials\u2026 were quick to respond (after the altercation), and the order within the crowd was immediately restored,\u201d local police chief Dilbag Singh told the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\n\u201cBut by that time, the damage had been done,\u201d he said.\n\nBut witnesses said that the authorities were badly organised, something denied by the shrine\u2019s management.\n\nAround a dozen people were also injured.\n\n\u2013 Holy sites \u2013\n\nMillions of shrines dot Hindu-majority India\u2019s cities, towns and villages as well as remote sites in the Himalayas and jungles in the south.\n\nSome are hugely important pilgrimage sites, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government has invested heavily in improving infrastructure to ease access.\n\nBefore the pandemic, every day about 100,000 devotees would trek up a steep winding track to the narrow cave containing the shrine to Vaishno Devi.\n\nRead Also\n\nAuthorities had capped the daily number to 25,000 but witnesses and press reports said that this may have been exceeded several times over.\n\n\u201cThere were at least 100,000 people there. No one was checking registration slips of the devotees,\u201d said Ravinder, who only gave one name.\n\n\u201cI have been there many times but (I have) never seen such a rush of people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was only when some of us managed to lift a dead body up with our hands that people could see (what was happening) and made space for moving the bodies out.\u201d\n\nAnother witness who came from Ghaziabad outside New Delhi with a group of around 10 people said there was clearly \u201cmismanagement\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf (they had known) that so much crowding was happening, they should have stopped the people,\u201d the man said without giving his name.\n\n\u2013 Horse or helicopter \u2013\n\nIn 2008, two stampedes in as many months in India left more than 370 Hindus dead. Others in Kerala in 2011 and in Madhya Pradesh two years later each killed more than 100.\n\nThe shrine to Vaishno Devi, a manifestation of Hindu goddess Vaishnavi, is in the hills some 60 kilometres from the city of Jammu. It saw 8.5 million visitors in 2018.\n\nPeople travel to the nearby busy town of Katra and then trek upwards for around 15 kilometres on foot or by pony \u2014 there is also a helicopter service \u2014 along a winding track lined with stalls as well as monkeys.\n\nOnce they have reached the cave entrance they often have to wait for hours.\n\nModi, wearing a saffron scarf, rode a pony up to the shrine shortly before being elected in 2014.\n\nHe said on Twitter that he was \u201cextremely saddened\u201d by the tragedy.\n\nAFP",

From January to December, our administration touched every area of human endeavours, aimed at improving the standard of living of the residents.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu stressed further that: \u201cIn the year 2022, our administration will continue to work with the residents to deliver more on our promise of a greater Lagos, in line with the Appropriation Bill, which I just signed into Law. The citizens will witness more infrastructural renewals, school rehabilitation and construction, hospitals, roads and improved security as well as social welfare.\n\n\u201cI acknowledge the perseverance and resilience of our people in the face of the current socio-economic challenges that were brought upon the nation by the coronavirus pandemic. In the true spirit of Lagos, we will remain resolute with a renewed vigour to face the new year, more determined to succeed together as a people.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all residents to shun acts of divisiveness and embrace true love for our nation and our dear State. Let us work together to bequeath a great legacy for our teeming youth and the coming generation.

Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal paid a courtesy call on His eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto in his palace over the weekend.\n\nWike expressed dismay over the wanton killing of innocent citizens by bandits in Sokoto and other parts of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have had a long-standing relationship and so the people of Rivers State have told me to commiserate with you and the people of Sokoto State. I\u2019m sorry for what happened and we believe God will give the families that have lost their loved ones the courage, give them the strength to bear this unnecessary loss of lives.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was accompanied by a delegation of Rivers\u2019 elders, also thanked the Sultan for the role he has been playing to ensure the stability of the country\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to stabilise all the religious groups, all the ethnic groups, to understand we have no other country than our country call Nigeria. You have always spoken out irrespective of whether he touches on Moslems, whether it touches on Christians, on whether it touches on those who don\u2019t have religion.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always spoken out and you have admonished government where necessary in terms of insecurity, in terms of other crisis, in terms of poverty. You have always spoken out and to advise the government on the best way to try and see that things get better for the citizens of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said it takes somebody who has passion and undying love for the country to play the kind of role the Sultan has been playing to ensure stability and unity of the nation\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThis character in you is rare. If all leaders can exhibit this kind of trait, then we will have a future, then we can know that our country is going somewhere. You\u2019re exhibiting the character that is expected of leadership.\n\n\u201cYou have had sleepless nights talking to Christians, talking to Moslems, talking to the North, talking to the South, talking to everybody to see ourselves as one Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHowever, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, in his response thanked Governor Wike and the Rivers\u2019 delegation for the brotherly visit, blaming lack of love for the prevalence of killings, confusion and acrimonious relationship in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there is love, all the acrimonious we hear, all the confusion all over the place, the killings won\u2019t have taken place. People kill without any motive. Bloodthirsty people kill anyhow because there is no love, and there is no godliness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever we have done, it is what our forefathers and religion ordered us to do, and we will do more to strengthen our relationship so that we can have a peaceful society.\n\n\u201cSo that we can have a country that we can be proud of and say yes, this is the Nigeria that we dream of.

          "text": "As the world celebrates the start of a New Year today, January 1, 2022 Archbishop Prof Sam Zuga who is the world\u2019s first professor of digital economy and founder of Samzuga Business Empire Ltd has penned his New Year message to all Nigerian Youths on how to achieve tremendous financial breakthrough with Zugacoin.\n\nThe Cleric also known as Jehovah\u2019s Field Marshall had created Zugacoin on December 1, 2020 with the aim of providing ways to help every willing, average Nigerian to have financial liberation and earn a better living.\n\nThrough his Social media platforms, Sam Zuga penned his lengthy New Year message.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cA Teacher doesn\u2019t teach Students what they want to hear, he teaches them what they need to know. I am not going to tell you what you want to hear but I will tell you what you need to know. Take your time to read many times.\n\nBefore I go into the message, I want to remind you that, Politicians only think about the next election, State Men always think about the next generation. I am not preparing you for the next meal, I am teaching you how to feed your generation. Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu fought for the freedom of South Africans, but they are no more. It is the duty of South Africans to sustain and maintain that freedom. I am only doing what I can do while I am alive, if you refuse to do what you need to do because you have me to mock and complain, one day, you will not see me again to complain, then you will learn how to face reality.\n\nI want to start by saying; the best way to solve a problem is to identify that problem. Everyone says the problem of Nigeria and Africa is poverty, but I identify the problem of Nigeria as Nigerians and Africans as the problem of Africa. I will use this medium to redirect you on how to enjoy the best country Nigeria and the richest continent Africa.\n\nThe major problem of Nigerians and Africans is ATTITUDE The way they think, the way they talk and the way they act. Your ATTITUDE will determine your ALTITUDE.\n\nI relocated to Dubai and was doing very well. Got the license to become an importer of gold, got my resident permit and was ready to tour the whole world using my private jet, before I saw what young Nigerians were going through in Dubai and changed my mind to return to Nigeria and create another NIGERIA inside Nigeria.\n\nThe vision of Nigeria and African Liberation was given to me on 02/02/2020 by 7am at house no 7, 7th Street, Hamariah area in Dubai. I took a decision to return to Nigeria. I addressed the few young Nigerians in Dubai by 10am on 10/02/2020. I moved to Nigeria and launched this vision at Ribadu square, Jimeta-Yola Adamawa State by 2.00pm on 20/02/2020.\n\nI knew very well that I cannot change the whole Nigeria because not everyone will believe in me. Therefore, I decided to gather few Nigerians and teach them a complete new way of life, have our own community where my voice will be the final voice, nobody will argue with me to enable me release my potentials without hindrance, we will have our own currency and I will bring Dubai in their lives. The same way I saw indigenes in Dubai living in financial freedom at the expense of non indigenes. That is why I established SAMZUGA FOUNDATION MULTI PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETY LTD, also known as SAMZUGA FAMILY, registered it to be operating within the confines of the law. ZUGACOIN was created to be used by only the members of this family for goods and services. Members were supposed to be selling it to non members who may also want to enjoy like members and get cash anytime they need cash That is why ZUGACOIN was mined only 1 Million pieces but with the capacity of taking care of the whole Africa. This was meant to be possible only through strict obedience to my instructions, not what I am seeing today. That is why ZUGACOIN was given free to registered members according to their registration. I didn\u2019t sell ZUGACOIN ERC20 to anyone till now. I was expecting to control only 1% of Nigerian population, change them to go and change others.\n\nBefore you score a goal, you must have a goal post. 24 months was our goal post beginning from 1/12/2020 to make ZUGACOIN known and accepted. 5 years was our target to see everyone who believe in my vision in Nigeria and Africa to be financially stable.\n\nWhen non members started buying from members, misunderstanding of my vision and misinformation set in. People started having misinterpretation and misconception which followed by misconduct. They want ZUGACOIN to be swapped to other Cryptocurrencies but the foundation was not like that. ZUGACOIN BEP20 was later created for people who want cash out, withdrawal to local bank accounts. Pressure still continue till we decided to create manual withdrawal of ZUGACOIN ERC20, pressure didn\u2019t stop, they insisted on automatic withdrawal, we have to go back and drag our brains and come up with a means to achieve automatic withdrawal. All these struggles was to make unbelievers of the vision to see ZUGACOIN as money and start using it for goods and services. After achieving automatic withdrawal, everyone stop selling ZUGACOIN as they have been selling, 98% of ZUGACOIN holders come and settled for withdrawal and forgot about the spread of ZUGACOIN which is the only way that can give them the financial freedom they are looking for. At the time of this publication, many people are confused except me. At this point, I want you to obey the following instructions strictly for your own good.\n\nStop thinking, talking and acting evil against ZUGACOIN. Start thinking, talking and acting good about ZUGACOIN. Know that ZUGACOIN project is a success already. Stop forcing me to see problems in ZUGACOIN the same way you are seeing it. Stop bringing suggestions because I started the journey and know where I am going, you just relax and enjoy yourself. When you notice a glitch, report immediately, don\u2019t take advantage of it. Understand that ZUGACOIN ERC20 is a unique product that is incomparable to any other Cryptocurrency. It is the first 3 in1 Cryptocurrency in the world. (A) you can use to buy things.( B) you can keep it as a commodity or property to appreciate and sell it for cash.( C) you can withdraw it to your local bank account when you need cash. ZUGACOIN ERC20 is not for trading, it will keep growing in value until it will reach 1 billion dollars and above. This is the only project that can liberate Africa. ZUGACOIN BEP20 is like any other Cryptocurrency. It can grow in value when people are buying it, it will drop or dip when many people are withdrawing or selling off. This is purely for trading. Green ZUGACOIN is for investors who wants their money to grow and they will use it in future. It is tradeable as soon as it is released to private wallets It is supported by United Nations climate change program.\n\nMany trainings will take place to let you understand the workings of this project. You will be told what to do from time to time.\n\nIn conclusion, 2022 is our year of Stability and rest. You shall be winning without sweat. Think of 7 things. Write down the 7 things that you want God to do for you through ZUGACOIN and place on the wall in your bedroom. Say them out every morning before going out and say them out before sleeping everyday. Take steps towards achieving those 7 things every single day. Many of them will happen before the 7th month of the year. This is my secret of success since 2005.\n\nREMEMBER TO BE FOLLOWING MY INSTRUCTIONS STRICTLY WITHOUT ARGUMENT, YOU WILL LIVE A STRESS FREE LIFE.\n\nWelcome to your year of Stability and rest, you shall be winning without sweat.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nArchbishop Prof Sam Zuga.\u201d",

          "text": "The Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Mr. Tony Adun, popularly known as Tony Kabaka, who made fame as a die-hard loyalist of former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, is in the news.\n\nThis time, he is not been reported for standing up for the former APC national chairman or taking another swipe at Governor Godwin Obaseki and or the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as he is known to do, rather all eyes are on him as he makes peace with Obaseki, the man with whom he fought endlessly, leading to the demolishing of his hotel in Benin City\u2019s GRA by the state government.\n\nIt will be recalled that Kabaka and the government had been at logger heads over the location of his hotel. The Obaseki administration eventually demolished the facility on the ground that it was located on land acquired by the government. A Benin City High Court recently ordered the government to rebuild the hotel.\n\nWhile Oshiomhole and Obaseki were at war over control of the APC in the state, Adun led many other party chieftains to dare the governor in open support of the then APC National Chairman.\n\nDuring the week, following the governor\u2019s invitation, Kabaka showed up at the Government House, Benin City, to receive gift items to celebrate the festivities with his family. Not a few of his critics and supporters expressed surprise at the appearance of the APC Youth Leader at the Government House. Sources however said his visit to Obaseki was actually the culmination of weeks of reconciliation talks between the two parties.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nReceiving Kabaka, Obaseki said despite belonging to a different political party, he was not an enemy but friends with Adun, adding, \u201cI am governor to all Edo people, irrespective of political affiliations. I welcome Tony Kabaka to the Government House. In the mood for Christmas and reconciliation, this cow and bags of rice are for you and your family to celebrate Christmas. Obaseki was represented by his Chief of Staff, Osaigbovo Iyoha.\n\nKabaka thanked Obaseki for his kind gesture and forgiving spirit, adding that politics is not a do-or-die affair.\n\nSpeaking on the past, he said his earleir criticism of Obaseki\u2019s government was aimed at putting the administration on its toes to deliver quality projects to the people of the State.\n\nHe said: \u201cYour Excellency, may God bless you for these gifts. I thank you for having mercy on me. I never expected this from you; I am happy with what you have done for me today.\n\n\u201cPolitics is a game; the opposition party criticizes the government to enable them work effectively for the people of Edo State and also develop the State. Politics is not a do or die affair. I am happy; this will show a good example to others that despite our various political divides, we are still brothers and family. The governor is my brother and this kind gesture of Christmas gift from him shows that politics is not a do or die affair; this move is encouraging, as I am learning from him.\u201d\n\nAfter the speeches, Kabaka, the popular APC enforcer, left Government House with one big cow and some bags of rice, courtesy of the now PDP governor and political archrival of Oshiomhole; the same Obaseki who approved the demolition of Kabaka\u2019s hotel.\n\nWhat many are waiting to see is whether Adun is about to forget about the government rebuilding his hotel after the rice and meat meal or he will still fight the governor after savouring his delicacies.\n\nWhat is also not clear is the state of the once-feared activist\u2019s ties with the erstwhile APC chair who he and other supporters often hail as \u2018Oshio Baba.\u2019 Was this reconciliation with the knowledge of Kabaka\u2019s longtime political boss, or are we about to witness a seismic shift in political loyalties in Edo State?

          "text": "New jobs are on the way for Nigerians in the new year, according to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe President, in his New Year message, said his administration would deploy ICT (Information and Communications Technology) platforms for the purpose of job creation and also ensure the diversification of the economy to support other emerging sectors.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan asked Nigerians to continue having faith in the country and its democratic institutions while National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said that given the way Nigerians fought to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no doubt that they can equally \u201cstand up to problems that seek to shackle us.\u201d\n\nThere were similar goodwill messages from other political leaders.\n\nBuhari hailed Nigerians for their resilience in facing \u201csignificant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn the security challenge, he promised that government would not relent in tackling the problem citing the \u201cnumber of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our security forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n\u201cGovernment, however, realises that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens.\n\n\u201cTo this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, Buhari said the 4.03% growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in the economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies the government has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges we have faced as a nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t lose faith in Nigeria, democracy, says Lawan\n\nIn a similar new year message, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said Nigerians should not lose faith in the country and its democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cThe current challenges will be overcome and become mere footnotes in our glorious national history,\u201d he said\n\nDescribing 2021 as a challenging year for people all over the world, the Senate President said: \u201cIt is praiseworthy that beyond the challenges, we can see the rays of a bright future from the new year.\n\n\u201cAs your elected representatives, our new year pledge is to continue to pursue our common desire of a just, peaceful and prosperous country.\n\n\u201cWe promise to continue to discharge this responsibility without fear or malice, confident that by working in harmony, Nigerians will build the great country that is their abiding dream and manifest destiny.\u201d\n\nLawan spoke of the determination of the National Assembly to \u201cdeliver an Electoral Act that stands the test of time in safeguarding democracy and the electoral process in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are also looking forward to receiving the report of our Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution upon our resumption from recess. We believe that the outcome of this very important exercise will promote unity, stability and peaceful coexistence in our country.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act amendment bill and review of the 1999 Constitution will be topmost on our agenda as we reconvene for Legislative business in the new year.\u201d\n\nOmo-Agege challenges Nigerians on nation building in 2022\n\nDeputy President of the Senate Ovie Omo-Agege urged Nigerians to use the New Year to renew their commitment to nation building.\n\nThe Delta Central lawmaker said though the outgone year 2021 was challenging, complicated by the surge of Coronavirus, he was optimistic that the new year 2022 would be a year of recovery.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to continue to adhere strictly to COVID-19 safety guidelines in order to be insulated from the pandemic.\n\nOn the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, which President Muhammadu Buhari vetoed, the Deputy President of the Senate assured Nigerians that legislators would consult widely with their constituents before the National Assembly resumes on January 18, 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cStakeholders agree that the 2010 Electoral Act is no longer in tune with current realities, hence the need for new legal framework for our elections.\n\n\u201cConsultations with our constituents will start immediately after the New Year festivities to feel their pulse on the President\u2019s decision to decline assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and chart a way forward.\n\n\u201cWe assure Nigerians that within the first week of resumption, we will come up with a workable solution to resolve the impasse.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t throw away the baby with the bath water. Without a doubt, the amended bill has so many innovations that would improve our electoral fortunes in line with best democratic practices globally.\u201d\n\nReps Minority Caucus says enough of borrowing\n\nMinority Caucus in the House of Representatives told the Federal Government to stop what it called reckless accumulation of debts, and borrowing spree which have placed a huge economic burden on the nation.\n\nThe Caucus in a statement by its leader, Ndudi Elumelu, said government should take urgent steps in the new year to tackle poverty, unemployment, high costs and infrastructural retrogression by growing the productive sector and allowing hard working and creative Nigerians, especially the youths to meaningfully engage.\n\nThe Minority Caucus also said the government should end its lip service and adopt proactive measures to decisively tackle escalating acts of terrorism in the country, saying \u201cour citizens have suffered a lot and the New Year should usher in a new lease of life\u201d.\n\nIt said further that the government should be remorseful for its failures, use the New Year for deeper introspection, change its corrupt ways and focus on the wellbeing of the people ahead of its exit in 2023.\n\nMark preaches unity\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, pleaded with Nigerians to harp on those things that bring peace and unity to Nigeria in the new year rather than ruminating on issues that tend to undermine the cohesion of the country.\n\nMark said Nigeria has gone through turbulent times in the recent past; a situation he said must of a necessity be reversed for good.\n\n\u201cThe grim reality is that the harsh economy, insecurity in the land and political crises are taking a huge toll on the citizens. The deterioration is unacceptable and cannot continue,\u201d he stated.\n\nSenator Mark added: \u201cWe must avoid those fault lines and work towards cementing the fragmented culture and tradition of brotherhood in the coming years\u201d.\n\nEkweremadu charges FG to tackle insecurity\n\nFormer Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, urged the Federal Government to rescue Nigerians from insecurity by prioritising the decentralisation of policing, starting with state police in the New Year.\n\nEkweremadu regretted that a vast nation like Nigeria that should thrive on the strengths of agriculture and industrialisation was being overrun by multifarious criminal cartels, which have been exploiting the country\u2019s hugely unpoliced territories.\n\nAccording to him, the much needed development, good governance, and credible 2023 elections would rely overwhelmingly on security of the lives and properties of Nigerians.\n\nThe lawmaker noted that whereas more political leaders were coming to terms with the imperativeness of state police, the political will was still gravely lacking.\n\nKalu cautions against hate speech\n\nFormer Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu, said Nigerians should be steadfast, patriotic and optimistic in the new year.\n\nThe former Governor insisted that leaders at all levels of government must ensure the welfare of the people is a top priority on their agenda.\n\nHe added that the government and the governed must play complementary roles in building a prosperous, united and indivisible Nigeria.\n\nKalu made these remarks at his Igbere country home during the distribution of end of year gifts to his constituents as part of his annual end of year activities, according to a statement by his media office, in Abuja.\n\nEquity, justice, fairness will guarantee unity, says Nnamani\n\nA former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, said that a deliberate effort to promote equity, justice and fairness in the allocation and management of national resources would guarantee peace and unity among the diverse segments of the federation.\n\nNnamani (Enugu East Senatorial District) said perceived injustices in the country could be reversed if political leaders would make equity, justice and fairness the cardinal principle of governance.\n\nHe urged leaders at all levels to make conscious efforts to contain the escalating insecurity and restiveness in the land by doing the right thing.\n\nSylva: Let\u2019s keep hope alive\n\nMinister of State Petroleum Resources Chief Timipre Sylva predicted that 2022 would be better than 2021 in the nation\u2019s socio-political environment and therefore, urged Nigerians to keep hope of a better Nigeria alive in the new year.\n\n\u201c2022 is going to be a good year for Nigeria. Things have started shaping up and with our collective support and prayers, we will achieve the Nigeria of our dream. This is not the time to despair but to rekindle our hope of a great and prosperous Nigeria,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep hope alive and dream big in 2022. The outgoing year was a challenging one especially with the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said adding that despite the challenges that characterised the year, \u201cthe government of President Buhari was able to make some remarkable achievements in the different sectors of the nation\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s hope in 2022, says Ortom\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has praised residents of the state and Nigerians generally for their resilience in the face of daunting security and economic challenges in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe year 2021 was no doubt challenging.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said that notwithstanding the threat of insecurity in the country, his administration remains resolute to continue with its programmes and plans.\n\nHe said this in his New Year message to Nigerians as the country joins the rest of the world to welcome 2022.\n\nThe President, who commended the nation\u2019s security agencies for the efforts to restore peace, stressed that the issue of security will remain at the front burner, adding that as a follow up to his promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, his administration has invested heavily in re-equipping the military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that to win the war on insecurity, the hearts and minds of the affected citizens must be won. To this end, he said working with international partners and neighbouring countries, the Federal Government would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nWhile commiserating with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country, he assured that every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to him both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\nHe assured that his administration remains fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\nOn job creation, the President said in the New Year, his administration would leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of the economy creates more support to other emerging sectors.\n\nThe New Year Message reads thus:\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous nation of our dream.\n\nI salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\nThe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\nThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nThere is no doubt that the issue of security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nThe net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our security forces and continue to do so through various channels and the safe corridor created for that purpose.\n\nGovernment, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nOnce again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant military, police officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWe equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\nWe remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\nOn the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our nation.\n\nThe major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\nDespite the challenges we have faced as a nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\nJust like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the New Year.\n\nIn year 2022 and going forward, our administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\nWe have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offences, which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our administration is succeeding.\n\nIn the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the nation\u2019s anti-corruption agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\nDespite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\nAs we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nAs it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\nI wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.",

          "text": "New Year: Jonathan preaches peace\n\nAs the world prepares to usher in the new year, former President Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has charged Nigerians and other Africans to continue to work towards building inclusive, just and peaceful societies.\n\nDr. Jonathan stated this in his new year message in which he noted that 2022 presents new opportunities to \u201cbuild our nation for ourselves, our children and grandchildren .\u201d\n\nThe message read: \u201cI congratulate fellow Nigerians, Africans and friends across the world for the opportunity of entering into the New Year, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe past year was characterized by many global challenges amid the ravaging effect of COVID -19 and its variants.\n\n\u201cWe have continued to live with the new realities imposed by the pandemic and consequences resulting from existing problems such as insecurity, poverty and climate change.\n\n\u201cAcross the world, there is a global demand for justice, peace, hope, security and sustainable development.\n\nThe attainment of these global and national aspirations should occupy the hearts and minds of citizens and leaders in our nations in this New Year 2022, if we are to rebuild a better world for the upcoming generations.\n\n\u201cBuilding an inclusive, just and peaceful society is a task that we must prioritize in 2022, as we cannot afford the luxury of a nation with endless agitations. 2022 presents to us new opportunities to build our nation for ourselves, our children and grandchildren.\n\n\u201cLet us therefore live in love and unity, pursue peace and justice in all spheres and in all our engagements,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nAtiku tasks Nigerians on peace, unity\n\nFrom Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nFormer Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has charged Nigerians to commit themselves to the pursuit of peace and unity in the New Year.\n\nAtiku, in a New Year message, yesterday, noted that hate and strive do not build a nation, rather they destroy individuals faster. He noted that in the New Year, Nigerians must seek to do \u201csomething different and, in doing so, let us become peace ambassadors of God.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cthe outgone year came and went with challenges, especially with the second, third and fourth waves of the dreaded Corona Virus Disease; sundry upsets that troubled the peace and security in different parts of the country; a depressing economy and many touching stories of tragedies.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians, who lost dear ones to these calamities, it is my prayer that God shall continue to comfort the bereaved families.\n\n\u201cBut this New Year, 2022 promises to be a remarkable one. It is one year that is filled with hope and optimism. It is one year that comes with a unique opportunity for us to redefine the remainder of this decade.\n\nMoving forward into the decade of the 2020s, our New Year resolution should be about eschewing divisive and parochial tendencies and embracing inclusion and general good.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to kick the same can down the road, yet again. We need a reawakening. And it is a reawakening that must invigorate our unity as one people of one good country. That is the commitment that we must pursue in this New Year.\u201d\n\nNew Year: Kalu cautions political class against hate speech\n\nFormer Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Kalu has urged Nigerians to be steadfast, patriotic and optimistic ahead of the New Year.\n\nKalu, while applauding the citizenry for their continued support for President Muhammadu Buhari, cautioned the political class against inflammatory utterances capable of polarising the country.\n\nThe former governor stressed that leaders at all levels of government must ensure the welfare of the people is a top priority in their agenda, adding that the government and the governed must play complementing roles in building a prosperous, united and indivisible Nigeria.\n\nKalu, who made these remarks in his Igbere country home, during the distribution of end of year gifts to his constituents as part of his annual end-of-year activities, called on well meaning Nigerians to embrace philanthropy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we approach the new year, it is imperative to reflect on our achievements and challenges as individuals and as a nation.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, 2021 was a year of sober reflection and celebrations. For the country to attain enviable heights, we must shun acts that will divide the country.\n\n\u201cThe time is now for Nigerians, regardless of political, ethnic and religious differences, to sustain peace and harmony in a bid to build a just society. No country can thrive in an atmosphere of disharmony.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s cultural, ethnic and religious diversity must be harnessed for growth and progress of the country. We must not allow political or religious sentiments to take Nigeria backward.\n\n\u201cLet us engage people in government in constructive criticisms as against hate speech and campaign of calumny.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIn the new year, we must imbibe good moral conduct in our daily pursuits for the sake of peace and unity.\u201d\n\nThe former governor wished Nigerians a prosperous new year.\n\nLet\u2019s enter New Year with hope, Tinubu charges Nigerians\n\nNational leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has charged Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s efforts to curtail insecurity and other challenges confronting the country.\n\nIn his New Year message, Tinubu said 2021 was a difficult year but urged Nigerians to enter the New Year \u201cwith hope and with the unyielding determination that our hope and collective toil will succeed in bringing forth a more prosperous and just nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsecurity is here in many areas. But we will battle and battle until it is subdued and extinguished from the face of the nation. President Muhammadu Buhari and our security agencies are doing their best to confront the menace. The President has vowed to end this evil. Let\u2019s us join and support him in this common cause regardless of partisan or other affiliation.\n\nWe have an economy to continue to build. Youths in need of jobs. The elderly and the sick in need of care. Infrastructure in need of building. Poverty in need of chasing away. Hunger in need of disappearing. Compassion and care in need of growing.\n\n\u201cLet us focus on these things. For in achieving these things, we achieve a better Nigeria for us all. I urge Nigerians to continue to be law-abiding, peaceful and most strongly committed to the national project upon which we have embarked and for which so many have toiled and sacrificed.\n\n\u201cLet us vow in unshakable promise to dedicate this year and our strongest effort to the welfare and progress of our people.\u201d\n\nOyetola urges Osun people to approach New Year with renewed hope, faith\n\nGovernor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun has urged the people of Osun State to approach the new year with renewed hope and faith, just as he appreciated them for their patience, support, cooperation and constructive criticism shown to his government.\n\nHe urged the people to continue to support his administration\u2019s policies and programmes so as to achieve more desired development.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press secretary, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola said: \u201c2022 is no doubt an election year for us in Osun. But I want to assure the good people of Osun that governance will not go on holiday. As we have proved in the last three years that it is not our style to mix politics with governance, we will continue to deliver on our camping promises.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to achieve inclusive socio-economic growth that is rooted in our Ten-Year Osun Development Plan (2019-2028). Our plan rests on four developmental pillars: Economic Development, Infrastructure Development, Human Capital Development and Security, and Environmental Sustainability. This plan is on autopilot.\n\n\u201cWe are resolute on gearing up the momentum of building on the achievements so far, and by so doing, delivering accelerated economic growth and development.\n\n\u201cI rejoice with Nigerians, particularly citizens and residents of Osun, on behalf of my family and the government on the celebration of the New Year \u2014 2022.\n\nAnyim felicitates Nigerians on New Year\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim has charged Nigerians to demonstrate courage and determination to pull the country back from the precipice in the new year.\n\nIn his new year message, the former Senate President noted that 2022 offers us new hope and fresh opportunities.\n\nSaid he: \u201c2021 was a challenging year. A combination of natural disasters and man-made crisis put Nigeria and Nigerians through very challenging life-tests that stretched our capacities for endurance to the limits.\n\n\u201cEconomic crisis manifested in inflation, unemployment, under-employment, job losses, weak Naira and general low earning capacities that brought Nigerians face to face with threat to their very survival.\n\n\u201cInsecurity which many citizens had wished would abate got a resurgence in 2021, compounding the already difficult life for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAgain, there was the COVID-19 pandemic which made a devastating come- back in other variants that shrank social and economic interactions further, and retarded the initial modest economic recoveries made after the first pandemic in 2019.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we all still mourn many Nigerians that died and lament for those that got dislocated, some permanently, from these sad developments of 2021.\n\n\u201cFrom the ashes of 2021, I see hope for Nigerians in the New Year 2022. God promises us hope in times of despair, strength in times of weakness, recovery after tragedies. Our maker also promised that He will never forsake us in times of trouble.\n\n\u201cI therefore charge Nigerians to key into the promises of God in this New Year and stand strong as the overcomers we are as children of God. In 2022, let us demonstrate courage and determination to pull our country back from the precipice. One way of achieving this triumph is by taking even more seriously, our duties as citizens and obligations to be our brothers\u2019 keepers. We must dedicate ourselves to building a more peaceful and cohesive society with justice and equity for all our people and neighbours.\u201d",

          "text": "From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti\n\nMr Oluwasola and Mrs Adedoyin Fadare, both from Ekiti State, are the parents of the late Demilade Fadare, the seven- year-old girl that was murdered on December 6 in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. She was allegedly killed by one Sikemi Olajiga, 31, daughter of Pastor Olajiga, a minister with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in Ado-Ekiti.\n\nFadare, a civil servant, works and resides in Lagos State while his wife, also a civil servant, and their children live at Boluwaduro Street, Adehun, in the Ekiti State capital.\n\nThe late Demilade turned 7 on October 8, 2021, about two months before she was despatched to her grave\n\nSaturday Sun reporter recently sat with the disconsolate parents of the young girl in Ado-Ekiti. And they poured out their grief.\n\nHer mother, Mrs Fadare, explained how the tragic incident happened.\n\nRelationship with my daughter\u2019s alleged killers\n\nWe have been living in that house since 2016 and our house is just a stone\u2019s throw from the house of the Olajigas. The only demarcation between our compound and theirs is just a fence. If you are at the backyard of our house you will be looking at their house directly.\n\nAs for our relationship with them, we are not cordial and we are not enemies. Pastor Olajiga parks his car in our compound. I used to drop my kids in their house, but when they started complaining of being maltreated, I stopped dropping them there. My kids call Pastor Olajiga and his wife grandpa and grandma.\n\nHow incident happened\n\nOn December 6, at 8:45am, I sent Demilade to get pap from the next street and I was doing the laundry. When by 9am I didn\u2019t see her, I told her sisters to stay inside, that I wanted to go and call Demilade and know what might be delaying her. I went there, and the man said he told her that it was only one pap that was available, and that she had returned home. I went back home, I called her name, I asked her sisters, they said she was not back. I went back to the pap seller. Then I went to Alhaja\u2019s place, as she also sells pap. Alhaja said she didn\u2019t see her but Alhaja\u2019s children said they saw her. I went back home, I didn\u2019t see her. I went back to the middle of that road and started shouting her name. Pastor Olajiga came out of his house and he said ah, God will make you see her. When Alhaja heard my voice, she joined me and some other people too. We started shouting her name together. I went her school to check, but she was not there. I ran back to the house, I picked her younger sisters and dropped them with another person on the street and I started looking for her. Seconds turned to minutes, minutes turned to hours. I called my husband who had travelled back to Lagos the previous day and he contacted the Flush department of Ekiti State. I kept on shouting that wherever Demilade was they should bring her out. From there, I was told to go to the Civil Defence office, I went there and made my report, I wrote my statement. My husband called and told me that some pastors had been praying and they said Demilade was in that street, that we should go back and start from house to house, that we would find her. I went back to the street. I thought the Yahoo boys in the area might have kidnapped her. I stood in front of their house and started shouting. People had barricaded the roads, that there should be no movement of vehicles or motorcycles out of the street. I received a call from the Civil Defence office that I didn\u2019t sign a particular document that I should come back. Meanwhile, the Flush operatives had decided that they would start a house-to-house search. I went back to the Civil Defence office, and by the time I got back home they said they had searched all the houses on the street, that nothing was found. The search went on for hours, I didn\u2019t see Demilade. I had contacted my friends that Demilade was missing, and flyers were made, the social media had been awash with her pictures in raising the alarm and people had started praying. From there, I went to the police station at Okeila, I was told it was not yet up to 24 hours, that it must be 24 hours before they would declare her missing, that we should go to the one at Okesa, that there is a control room there that they will radio the information all around in case she has been transported away from that street so that the patrol team on the road will be able to get the information. I went there. They got the information. It was radioed all around. From there, I headed to the Ewi\u2019s Palace to lay my complaints. From the palace we went to Amotekun office at Poly Road. Different search parties were going one.\n\nWhen I came back in the evening, I heard that Pastor Olajiga didn\u2019t allow the Flush operatives to enter his apartment, that his wife took the key to work. Mr Olajiga takes his wife to work every morning, and he comes to our compound to pick his car as early as 6:30 or 7:00am. Then he would return home before 9:00am. That means he was back already after dropping his wife at work when he came out to meet me. I started wondering why he would lie to the operatives that his wife took the keys to work. But I just waved it off because he had joined us in the search.\n\nMeanwhile, when Demilade\u2019s playmate came back from school that day, she said she saw Demilade that morning standing in front of our gate talking with someone. The girl said the person was wearing a blue top and black clothes. Then I remembered that on my way to the palace, I saw Sikemi on the road. What she wore was like what the little girl described. The search went on and on till late in the midnight. I could not sleep, my husband could not sleep. We were out on the street. I said if they kidnapped her, they would probably drop her in the middle of the night and she wouldn\u2019t be able to come home on her own in the dark. We didn\u2019t go inside, we were out till 3:00 am. We were even sitting rightly opposite the Olajiga\u2019s house.\n\nI did not even know they were not at home. When Mr Olajiga\u2019s wife came back from work, she joined us in prayers that we would see Demilade, she was speaking in tongues and praying, the husband was praying too.\n\nBut I noticed something, in the morning when I was looking for Demilade, Pastor Olajiga was putting on a blue shirt when he came out. Later when I saw him, he was putting on an orange shirt. It was the second day when I heard that my daughter was killed by the Olajigas that my instinct went there. Perhaps it was after they killed and cleaned her blood, probably his shirt was stained that was why he changed it. Sikemi did not change her clothes till she was found the next day.\n\nThere was no stain of blood on her clothes. Now he is claiming that Sikemi is mad, that she is the one that killed Demilade. She did not change her clothes, there was no stain of blood on her. So, his lies are so transparent and I still want to see them and ask what my family has done to them to deserve this horrible thing. I don\u2019t know why they have done this to my family.\n\n\u201cIt was on Tuesday, December 7 that I was told that my daughter was murdered by the Olajigas. I didn\u2019t know people in the area had known late in the evening on the day of the incident and nobody told me anything. People had told me in the afternoon that all of them were going to do a vigil, that nobody was going to sleep. But I noticed that they all just dispersed and went home. They all left and I was wondering what happened. It was me, my husband, my husband\u2019s friend and Alhaja, the four of us that sat in the middle of the road, waiting for the kidnapper to drop Demilade. My husband said we should go inside at 3:00am, and we went inside. When it was 4:30am, I ran out again and started looking for Demilade, in fact, I was throwing stones on gates that neighbours should come out, that they were not even bothered anymore and they all could sleep overnight. I was so furious. I sat in front of Joy Estate till 8:00am then they stylishly took me away from there and took me to a friend\u2019s place, from there to my in-laws place. That was when they told me that my daughter had been murdered.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cNow, Mr Olajiga is claiming that Sikemi is mad. Sikemi that I know has her full senses in check. Sikemi grinds pepper. She still ground the pepper and moin-moin that we ate at home. She sews clothes. Sikemi once came to my house about some months ago to borrow my laptop and I refused to give her. It was my husband that said I should lend her after she told my husband that she wanted to use it to type church programme. Only God knows what she did, may be she took the pictures of my children from my laptop I don\u2019t know.\n\nThey said Sikemi is mad, there were some neighbours that did drop their children in their house until they left our street. Those people were dropping two children with them every day until they moved out of our street some months ago, but before they moved out, those children were staying in that house from morning till night until their parents come back, Sikemi didn\u2019t kill those children. Sikemi is not mad at all.\n\n\u201cWill Mr Olajiga say he didn\u2019t know when Sikemi brought Demilade inside? Because there is only one entrance to their house. Will he say he didn\u2019t know when Demilade came inside? Will Mr Olajiga say he didn\u2019t know someone was inside? After it happened and I was shouting my daughter\u2019s name, will he say he didn\u2019t know what was going on? All this period Pastor Olajiga had taken his wife to the office and was back home. So, saying that Sikemi is mad is a big lie. I want justice for my daughter. I want nothing but Justice. Demilade did not deserve this at all. Demilade was loved by everybody. She was an innocent girl. She wanted a good life. She said she wanted to be an actor, that she wanted people to see her on the television and in movies. She just learnt a new dance step and she was showing me on Saturday before the incident happened on Monday.\n\nDemilade\u2019s father speaks\n\nDemilade\u2019s father, Mr Oluwasola Fadare also spoke with the reporter. His words: I had been in Ado-Ekiti to see my family and had spent some days with them. I left on Sunday, December 5. I work in Lagos State and I come on a visit periodically to see them. On Monday morning, which was December 6, I had called them earlier that morning because I used to call them every morning before they went to school, when they get back from school, that is if they are in session in school and before they sleep at night. Even while I was around with them I was the one who drove them to school for their Christmas Carol, which came up on Thursday December 2.\n\nOn Monday morning, my wife called me, that she sent Demilade on an errand and that she had been looking for her, that she was nowhere to be found. Immediately, I called my friends here in Ado-Ekiti who are security agents. I called the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and Flush department and I called some officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) that I know in Ado-Ekiti.\n\nThough, before I left Lagos that Monday morning for Ado-Ekiti, I had called a pastor and the pastor said Demilade was somewhere close to our house where we live, that we should be swift about it, that she was held hostage. Later, one of my friends called me back that they had searched all the houses, and barricaded every entrance and exit to the street. Because we stay around Yahoo boys, the search was focused on Yahoo boys on the street. When my friend called me, he said they went to a house, that they met a man sitting outside that they told the man that they had been searching around, they identified themselves, that they wanted to search his house but the man told them that the wife had taken the key to the whole apartment to work. My friend said someone was passing by and the person said this man is a pastor, so, they left the place and conducted a recheck on other houses.\n\n\u201cMuch later, I was worried while I was on my way from Lagos. When I got to Ekiti around past five or to six in the evening, I told my friend who came to pick me up from the park that I wanted to drop in front of Joy Estate. So, immediately I dropped in front of Joy Estate, I sighted Pastor Olajiga.\n\nHis house is not far from Joy Estate. I was at the building after Joy Estate. Immediately he saw me, he fidgeted. This was somebody that parked his car in our house. We call him grandpa. I even felt he wanted to sympathise with me but instead, he went to his car. He didn\u2019t say anything. But I noticed inside his car were his wife in the front seat and his two female children at the back. Upon sighing me, he went towards his car, entered it and drove off.\n\n\u201cIt was the following day that I got to know that Pastor Olajiga went to report at the police station at Okeila that his daughter had murdered Demilade. It was the following day in the morning that they called me. Immediately I got to the street, I was driving and my friend said why would I be driving by myself? They told me to come down. I saw a police van stationed in front of Pastor Olajiga\u2019s house. There is a prison officer that stays on our street. So we all went \u2013 myself, my cousin, the prison controller and the police officers to the police station. From there, we went to the state CID. That was where they narrated everything to me that Mr Olajiga came to report on Monday evening that his insane daughter murdered Demilade, I wept.\n\nSo, at the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) homicide department, I requested that I needed to see Mr and Mrs Olajiga since they told me that they came to report and were detained, to ask some certain questions from them. They brought Pastor Olajiga and his wife out, I asked that what have I done to them to deserve this? We are neighbours, you park your car in our compound, I don\u2019t know what I have done. We are not age mates. We don\u2019t have anything in common. Mr Olajiga didn\u2019t utter a word at that point while I was asking the questions, but the wife said \u201cWe are not the ones.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with the DCP and Pastor Olajiga and his wife, my wife called that I should help her get some of her clothes. I went to the house. While leaving the house, someone called me that Sikemi had been accosted. Pastor Olajiga\u2019s daughter, the alleged killer of Demilade, that they had accosted her at Carwash junction, Adehun, Ado-Ekiti. My cousin drove me down to the place. When I got there, the mob was so much. Sikemi was found with a brand new two edged cutlass, a bunch of keys to their house, two beef sausage rolls (Gala),and a debit card ,all in a sack. They held and walked her to her father\u2019s house. The mob was too much. On getting to their house, when I noticed the mob was about putting tyre round her neck. I went to beg the mob not to kill her so that I could get justice.\n\n\u201cAt the time I was inside the car, the police vans were already around, I think about four or five of their vans. By God\u2019s grace and with the efforts of the police, we were able to arrest the situation. We got her into the van and drove her off.\n\nQuestions\n\n\u201cBut I am still left with some questions. They said Sikemi is not mentally stable, but she grinds pepper, she sews clothes. If she is mad, why is she staying with her parents? Mr Olajiga\u2019s grandchildren do come around. If she is mad, she should have in one way or the other attacked them. No sane person will live with someone who is mad. You claim she is insane, I believe anyone who is insane should be confined or maybe should be going through a psychiatric treatment. I am still trying to wrap my head round the whole scenario. We see him as a man of God and accorded him that respect. He parked his car in our compound and even had a portion where he parked his car.\n\n\u201cI went to the mortuary to see Demilade on Tuesday. I saw her body. With what I saw, she struggled with her killers. They slit her throat and they stabbed her. I want justice on this matter. My family wants justice.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2018We remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to building the great and prosperous Nation of our dream\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians to welcome the year 2022 with hope and envisions a year of continued progress against combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nThe President, in his New Year message to the nation, said the persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country might have threatened the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress.\n\nAccording to him, the path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nBuhari, while noting that the issue of security remains one of the priority areas that his administration had given utmost attention, said as a follow up to its promise to re-energise and reorganise the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, his administration had invested heavily in re-equipping the military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nThe net results of these efforts, according to him, have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\nThe President said his government realised that victory on the battlefield was just one aspect of sustainable victory, \u201cas to fully win this war, the government must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens.\u201d\n\nTo this end, he said his administration would be working with international partners and neighbouring countries, as well as deploy multi-faceted solutions that would be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nBuhari lauded the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which according to him, was evident in 2021 as the nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the gallant military, police officers, and other security agents who had lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of the nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\nBuhari equally remembered and commiserated with Nigerians who had lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country, noting that every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to him both as a citizen and as the President.\n\nOn the economy, he said his administration had shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterised the nation\u2019s economy and the global economy.\n\nBuhari stressed that the major wins recorded could be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), with a 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021, indicative of the recovery being recorded in the economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that his administration had put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\n\u201cWe have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our administration is succeeding.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the accomplishments so far can be traced to the dedication of the nation\u2019s anti-corruption agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n\u201cAs it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says lawmakers will find way forward on direct primary clause\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan yesterday announced that the Senate would review the rejected Electoral Act Amendment Bill and the 1999 Constitution immediately it resumes plenary on January 18.\n\nThe National Assembly transmitted the Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari on November 19, last year, with recommendations on electronic transmission of results and direct primaries for political parties, among others.\n\nBut in a letter addressed to the upper and lower legislative chambers, Buhari kicked against the recommendation of direct primaries for political parties on the grounds that it \u201cviolates the spirit of democracy\u201d and subsequently declined to sign the Bill.\n\nIn a New Year statement he personally signed, titled \u201cLet\u2019s keep faith in Nigeria,\u201d Lawan said the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was handled with the spirit of patriotism, even though it was rejected by the President.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe believe that sustainable democratic governance requires a transparent and credible electoral process. Following the decision of President Buhari to withhold assent to the Bill, we shall make further consultations on the issues on our resumption of plenary in January.\n\n\u201cWe shall find a way forward on this critical legislation in the new year. We are determined to deliver an Electoral Act that stands the test of time in safeguarding democracy and the electoral process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to receiving the report of our Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution upon our resumption from recess. We believe that the outcome of this very important exercise will promote unity, stability and peaceful coexistence in our country.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act Amendment Bill and review of the 1999 constitution will be topmost on our agenda as we reconvene for Legislative business in the New Year.\u201d\n\nLawan also revealed that the promises made to Nigerians with respect to focusing on legislation had been kept by the ninth National Assembly.\n\nPointing out the gains of the Assembly, Lawan stated that the jinx of the Petroleum Industry Bill, which had defied passage for about two decades, was broken by the Assemblywhich got it signed last year.\n\nHe stated that the Assembly was focused and would never be distracted from the implementation of its Legislative Agenda as spelt out following its inauguration in 2019.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Year 2021 was challenging for people all over the world. It is praiseworthy that beyond the challenges, we can see the rays of a bright future from the New Year.\n\n\u201cAs your elected representatives, our new year pledge is to continue to pursue our common desire of a just, peaceful and prosperous country. We promise to continue to discharge this responsibility without fear or malice, confident that by working in harmony, Nigerians will build the great country that is their abiding dream andmanifest destiny.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, insecurity is today one of our biggest challenges. However, I can attest that the government is resolutely addressing these challenges. As a critical contribution to that effort, the National Assembly has appropriated more funds in the 2022 budget to enhance the operational capabilities of our security agencies.\u201d\n\nLawan urged Nigerians not lose faith in the country and its democratic institutions.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s challenges would be overcome and become mere footnotes in the nation\u2019s glorious national history.\n\nThe President of the Senate said the ninth National Assembly was focused and would never be distracted from the implementation of its Legislative Agenda as spelt out following their inauguration in 2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithin the context of that Agenda, we have passed many critical bills and have many more to roll out in the New Year.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of 2021, we made specific promises to the Nigerian people with respect to our legislative focus. We are proud that we have kept those promises.\n\n\u201cFor instance, breaking the jinx of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which had defied passage for about two decades, was high on our agenda in 2021. With the cooperation of the Executive and the support of the key stakeholders, we were able to break the jinx. We passed the Bill and got it signed into law in 2021.\n\n\u201cThis piece of legislation will significantly impact the Nigerian economy and propel a significant turnaround in our oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nOn the annual national budget, Lawan said: \u201cUpon our inauguration in 2019, the ninth National Assembly had promised to reset the national budget calendar to January to December cycle, to make our fiscal system predictable and consistent with international best practice. We have since 2019 passed the national yearly budget every December to enable the President to sign it into law before the New Year. In accordance with this, on Friday 31st December 2021, we witnessed the signing into law by the President, the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\n\u201cTimely passage of the budget enhances the performance of the economy and has specifically aided our recent quick recovery from recession. We are determined to sustain this trajectory to act as an impetus to our economic planning and projection.\n\n\u201cThe much that we have been able to accomplish this far can be attributed to the commitment and dedication of my fellow distinguished colleagues and honourable members and the prevailing atmosphere of cordiality between the National Assembly and the Executive. We intend to sustain and even improve on this in the New Year and beyond.\n\n\u201cI appeal for the continued understanding and support of all Nigerians for the government at all levels. As your legislators at the federal level, we will continue in the true spirit of our mantra to \u201cwork for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ready to submit amendment bill early 2022, assents to 2021 finance bill\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nAfter expressing deep concern about changes effected on the 2022 budget by the National Assembly, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday reluctantly signed the N17.127 trillion 2022 Appropriation Bill into law.\n\nThe presidency had submitted a N16.391 trillion proposal to the national assembly but the lawmakers increased the budget size to N17.127 trillion.\n\nThe President, who also assented to the 2021 Finance Bill at a brief ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja, further hinted of the readiness of his administration to submit an amendment to the 2022 Appropriation law to the legislative arm early in 2022 to take care of the alterations by the National Assembly.\n\nBuhari, while signing the two documents in the presence of Senate President, Ahmed Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), expressed strong reservations about the \u2018\u2018worrisome changes\u2019\u2019 to the budget.\n\nBuhari said the lawmakers reduced the amount allocated to some projects, but added 6,576 projects of their own to the 2022 budget.\n\nHe announced that he would revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment as soon as the Assembly resumed, to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to the administration did not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018I signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022. \u2018\u2018It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\n\n\u201cSome of the worrisome changes are as follows: Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances;\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification.\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed concern about the reductions in provisions for some critical projects, including N12.6 billion in the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing Rail Modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from Power Sector Reform Programme under the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\n\nThe President expressed his reservations about the \u2018\u2018Inclusion of new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reductionbin the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, the 2022 Budget provides for aggregate expenditures of N17.127 trillion, an increase of N735.85 billion over the initial Executive Proposal for a total expenditure of N16.391 trillion.\n\nThe President explained that N186.53 billion of the increase however came from additional critical expenditures that he had directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to forward to the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Minister will provide the public with the details of the budget as passed by the National Assembly, and signed into law by me,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari announced that as the 2023 Budget is going to be a transition budget, work would start in earnest to ensure early submission of the 2023-2025 Medium-Term\n\nExpenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper, as well as the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nHe, therefore, directed Heads of MDAs to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance,\n\nBudget and National Planning, more specifically with the Budget Office of the Federation, to realise this very important objective.\n\nOn COVID-19 and budget implementation, the President said despite the lingering adverse effects of the pandemic, he was happy with the success recorded in the implementation of the 2021 Budget.\n\nPresident Buhari commended the understanding and speedy action of the National Assembly on this matter.\n\nTo achieve the laudable objectives of the 2022 Budget, President Buhari pledged that the federal government would further intensify revenue mobilisation efforts.\n\nHe expressed optimism in the ability of the government to finance the budget considering the positive global oil market outlook and the continuing improvement in non-oil revenues.\n\nBuhari said: \u2018\u2018I also appeal to our fellow citizens and the business community at large to fulfill their tax obligations promptly.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, being a deficit budget, the specific Borrowing Plan will be forwarded to the\n\nNational Assembly shortly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I count on the cooperation of the National Assembly for a quick consideration and approval of the Plan when submitted.\n\n\u2018\u2018All borrowings will be judiciously utilised and invested in our future growth and prosperity.\u2019\u2019\n\nLawan Defends Lawmakers\n\nThe President of the Senate has said the National Assembly was correct in its judgment by tampering with Budget 2022.\n\nLawan spoke at the Presidential Villa shortly after the President signed the budget.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the most important thing is that Mr. President is happy with the majority of what the National Assembly has done. That is the most critical thing that we need to focus on.\n\n\u201cAs for the observations Mr. President has raised, this is a natural and logical tendency between the executive and the legislature. Sometimes, our views on certain issues may not be the executive\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think what the President did, by raising some observations, is something we should worry about. I\u2019m happy that the President signed the budget in the first place. And he said it\u2019s going back to the National Assembly to seek amendments or virement. This is a natural, logical legislative process.\n\n\u201cI believe that the National Assembly was right in its judgment, but there is nothing wrong in the executive arm of government coming back to the National Assembly to see how we\u2019re able to dialogue and go through the process and see where the misunderstanding is. But I don\u2019t think that is supposed to be a worrisome development for us.\u201d\n\nLawan further explained that government-owned enterprises should contribute double the N500 billion revenue reflected in the budget.\n\n\u201cThis is based on judgments why we asked for more resources coming from the independent sources, especially from the government-owned enterprises of about N400 billion to N500 billion is because we believe that these government-owned enterprises should contribute even much more. In fact, I hold the opinion that they should have contributed about a trillion, at least, not N500 billion or so.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Petroleum Trust Development Fund Boss Accused Of Corruption, Nepotism, Fraudulent Contract Award",
          "text": "The Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Trust Development Fund, Dr Bello Aliyu Gusau, has been accused of awarding fraudulent contracts without recourse to procedure and due process.\n\nHe was also accused of nepotism, marginalisation and diversion of agency funds into private pockets.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that since the appointment of Gusau in 2016, it had been a regime of indiscriminate awards of contracts to persons that either did not bid for contracts that the PTDF did not advertise.\n\nAccording to them, Gusau has abused all known procurement regulations in the agency.\n\n\u201cDr Gusau has turned the PTDF to an extension of his state where only his kinsmen are seen clutching files and folders from the procurement department. There are also instances where the ES kinsmen recommend who gets what from the PTDF. It is such an eyesore as it stands. If urgent steps are not taken, the PTDF might end up in a not too pleasant manner considering the strategic importance of its operations in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nHe further added that the Executive Secretary has formed the habit of bragging about his untouchable status in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\n\"He usually brags about his connection in the corridors of power and how he also has unhindered access to the President. It is quite sad because Yusuf has turned tyrant in the administration of the PTDF.\u201d\n\nAnother source stated that the Executive Secretary has been using resources from the PTDF to finance political activities in his home state.\n\nHe added that Yusuf has turned to a political cash-cow for politicians from his state.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, it seems the ES has political ambition, or he is sponsoring a political party or candidate in his home state. This is largely responsible for how he has turned the PTDF into an extension of his state. He has also formed the habit of awarding scholarships to select people, mostly from his state,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going at the PTDF, Nigeria might soon experience an embarrassment from foreign institutions where Nigerian students are on scholarship due to non-payment of tuition.\n\n\"We are on the verge of experiencing an embarrassment of unimaginable proportion. You won't believe that the PTDF has not met her obligations with foreign tertiary institutions where you have our students. The ES has diverted monies meant for tuition payment as it stands.\n\n\u201cSince the ES was reappointed, the PTDF has defaulted severally on these payments, not because of lack of funds, but rather the mismanagement of resources by the ES and his cronies. I am afraid that things are not going to change anytime soon with the attitude of the ES with regards to the resources of the organization,\u201d the source added.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that recruitment into the agency had been contracted to a firm owned by some cronies of Yusuf.\n\n\u201cI know one of those recently employed that didn't attend any interview, but her dad, a close friend of the ES of PTDF, brought home her letter of employment and asked her to resume work.\n\n\"She told me she didn\u2019t apply for a job at the PTDF. But her dad came home with a letter of employment and asked me to resume, which she did.\u201d\n\nAnother staff added that the Executive Secretary has succeeded in rubbishing \u201cwhatever structure left in the organisation\u201d.\n\nHe noted that Yusuf runs the PTDF as a private company where he decides who gets what and when.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that a man could be so brazen in recklessness. He does whatever he wants with the finances of the organisation. He dishes out overinflated contracts to only his kinsmen and many other anomalies that defeat common sense,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Dr Bello Gusau is a monumental embarrassment. The general public should not be deceived by his media grandstanding. We gathered that he has recently engaged the services of a public relations firm to launder his image in the media, all in a bid to cover up for his gross abuse office.\n\n\"I think the honourable thing for him to do is to resign from office because his atrocities are innumerable, as well as despicable. Nigerians should watch out in the days ahead; I am sure more of the rot in the TDF under Dr Bello Gusau would come in the public space,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari had in September 2020 renewed the appointment of Gusau.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Petroleum Trust Development Fund Boss Accused Of Corruption, Nepotism, Fraudulent Contract Award",
          "text": "The Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Trust Development Fund, Dr Bello Aliyu Gusau, has been accused of awarding fraudulent contracts without recourse to procedure and due process.\n\nHe was also accused of nepotism, marginalisation and diversion of agency funds into private pockets.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that since the appointment of Gusau in 2016, it had been a regime of indiscriminate awards of contracts to persons that either did not bid for contracts that the PTDF did not advertise.\n\nAccording to them, Gusau has abused all known procurement regulations in the agency.\n\n\u201cDr Gusau has turned the PTDF to an extension of his state where only his kinsmen are seen clutching files and folders from the procurement department. There are also instances where the ES kinsmen recommend who gets what from the PTDF. It is such an eyesore as it stands. If urgent steps are not taken, the PTDF might end up in a not too pleasant manner considering the strategic importance of its operations in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nHe further added that the Executive Secretary has formed the habit of bragging about his untouchable status in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\n\"He usually brags about his connection in the corridors of power and how he also has unhindered access to the President. It is quite sad because Yusuf has turned tyrant in the administration of the PTDF.\u201d\n\nAnother source stated that the Executive Secretary has been using resources from the PTDF to finance political activities in his home state.\n\nHe added that Yusuf has turned to a political cash-cow for politicians from his state.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, it seems the ES has political ambition, or he is sponsoring a political party or candidate in his home state. This is largely responsible for how he has turned the PTDF into an extension of his state. He has also formed the habit of awarding scholarships to select people, mostly from his state,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going at the PTDF, Nigeria might soon experience an embarrassment from foreign institutions where Nigerian students are on scholarship due to non-payment of tuition.\n\n\"We are on the verge of experiencing an embarrassment of unimaginable proportion. You won't believe that the PTDF has not met her obligations with foreign tertiary institutions where you have our students. The ES has diverted monies meant for tuition payment as it stands.\n\n\u201cSince the ES was reappointed, the PTDF has defaulted severally on these payments, not because of lack of funds, but rather the mismanagement of resources by the ES and his cronies. I am afraid that things are not going to change anytime soon with the attitude of the ES with regards to the resources of the organization,\u201d the source added.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that recruitment into the agency had been contracted to a firm owned by some cronies of Yusuf.\n\n\u201cI know one of those recently employed that didn't attend any interview, but her dad, a close friend of the ES of PTDF, brought home her letter of employment and asked her to resume work.\n\n\"She told me she didn\u2019t apply for a job at the PTDF. But her dad came home with a letter of employment and asked me to resume, which she did.\u201d\n\nAnother staff added that the Executive Secretary has succeeded in rubbishing \u201cwhatever structure left in the organisation\u201d.\n\nHe noted that Yusuf runs the PTDF as a private company where he decides who gets what and when.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that a man could be so brazen in recklessness. He does whatever he wants with the finances of the organisation. He dishes out overinflated contracts to only his kinsmen and many other anomalies that defeat common sense,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Dr Bello Gusau is a monumental embarrassment. The general public should not be deceived by his media grandstanding. We gathered that he has recently engaged the services of a public relations firm to launder his image in the media, all in a bid to cover up for his gross abuse office.\n\n\"I think the honourable thing for him to do is to resign from office because his atrocities are innumerable, as well as despicable. Nigerians should watch out in the days ahead; I am sure more of the rot in the TDF under Dr Bello Gusau would come in the public space,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari had in September 2020 renewed the appointment of Gusau.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assessed his administration\u2019s performances in various sectors of the economy in the outgoing year 2021, declaring that the recovery of the nation\u2019s economy remained on a steady path throughout the year.\n\nBuhari disclosed this in his January 1, 2022 message to Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the President, the country recorded some significant achievements in the year despite the turbulence that characterised the economy.\n\nThe message, obtained by SaharaReporters, partly read, \u201cWe equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n\u201cOn the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterised our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n\u201cThe major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn August 16, 2021, I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n\u201cJust like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n\u201cIn year 2022 and going forward, our administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\u201d\n\nAmidst the President\u2019s claim, the country\u2019s dwindling finances had come under intense pressure as the government is broke and has been amassing foreign loans.\n\nFor example, Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, while doctors were on strike over poor allowance, had in September 2021 confirmed that the Nigerian government under President Muhammadu Buhari borrowed funds from international sources to pay salaries of workers because of a shortfall in the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nNgige had said the government took borrowed funds from foreign institutions like the World Bank to offset some recurrent expenditures.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had in April 2021 admitted that Nigeria\u2019s economy was facing a difficult time, saying borrowing was inevitable.",

          "title": "QUESTION: With Osimhen, Dennis out... who'll score for Eagles at AFCON?",
          "text": "Austin Eguavoen, Super Eagles interim coach, will be without two of the most in-form Nigerian strikers at the moment when he leads the team out in Cameroon for the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) early this month. This will certainly be a major headache for a coach who will be trying to impress with his short spell of opportunity before handing over to Jose Peseiro in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Osimhen and Emmanuel Dennis were replaced in the Super Eagles 28-man provisional list by Henry Onyekuru and Peter Olayinka respectively over controversial reasons.\n\nOsimhen, who plays for Napoli, pulled out of the squad after testing positive for COVID-19 \u2014 a few days to AFCON. His COVID-19 status came amid the disagreements between the Italian side and the NFF over his match fitness.\n\nDennis, on the other hand, was withdrawn from the Eagles provisional list after Claudio Ranieri, his coach at Watford, claimed that the NFF sent the player\u2019s invitation later than the deadline stipulated by the English club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir absence at the tournament, which kicks off on January 9, 2022, means that Nigeria will arrive in Cameroon with a depleted vanguard.\n\nOsimhen\u2019s explosiveness was significant to the Eagles\u2019 modest success in 2021. The 22-year-old was involved in nine of the team\u2019s 13 goals last year; scored seven times and set up another two. He was the Eagles\u2019 highest goal scorer as the team secured an AFCON ticket and qualified for the final round of qualifiers for the Qatar 2022 World Cup.\n\nAlthough Dennis is yet to make his mark in the green and white jersey since his debut in 2019, his resurgence in the English Premier League (EPL) this season makes his absence a huge miss for Nigeria. The 24-year-old has been in a blistering form since his underreported move to Watford from Club Brugge in the summer. He joined the Hornets off an unimpressive loan spell at FC Koln, but he bit into the opportunity like a kid handed his favourite candy. His name that was known only by a handful of journalists a few months ago is now one of the most feared by defenders across England.

          "text": "Austin Eguavoen, Super Eagles interim coach, will be without two of the most in-form Nigerian strikers at the moment when he leads the team out in Cameroon for the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) early this month. This will certainly be a major headache for a coach who will be trying to impress with his short spell of opportunity before handing over to Jose Peseiro in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Osimhen and Emmanuel Dennis were replaced in the Super Eagles 28-man provisional list by Henry Onyekuru and Peter Olayinka respectively over controversial reasons.\n\nOsimhen, who plays for Napoli, pulled out of the squad after testing positive for COVID-19 \u2014 a few days to AFCON. His COVID-19 status came amid the disagreements between the Italian side and the NFF over his match fitness.\n\nDennis, on the other hand, was withdrawn from the Eagles provisional list after Claudio Ranieri, his coach at Watford, claimed that the NFF sent the player\u2019s invitation later than the deadline stipulated by the English club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir absence at the tournament, which kicks off on January 9, 2022, means that Nigeria will arrive in Cameroon with a depleted vanguard.\n\nOsimhen\u2019s explosiveness was significant to the Eagles\u2019 modest success in 2021. The 22-year-old was involved in nine of the team\u2019s 13 goals last year; scored seven times and set up another two. He was the Eagles\u2019 highest goal scorer as the team secured an AFCON ticket and qualified for the final round of qualifiers for the Qatar 2022 World Cup.\n\nAlthough Dennis is yet to make his mark in the green and white jersey since his debut in 2019, his resurgence in the English Premier League (EPL) this season makes his absence a huge miss for Nigeria. The 24-year-old has been in a blistering form since his underreported move to Watford from Club Brugge in the summer. He joined the Hornets off an unimpressive loan spell at FC Koln, but he bit into the opportunity like a kid handed his favourite candy. His name that was known only by a handful of journalists a few months ago is now one of the most feared by defenders across England. Only Mohammed Salah (15 goals, 9 assists) has more contribution than Dennis (8 goals, 5 assists) this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOTHER OPTIONS IN ATTACK?\n\nThe absence of the duo will be felt at the edge of the Eagles\u2019 attack at the AFCON, but the team has not become totally flaccid in the final third.\n\nThe powerful and dogged Taiwo Awoniyi finally has the opportunity to replicate his promising performances for Union Berlin in the shirt of the Eagles.

          "text": "With 3,598 deaths recorded from 107,911 suspected cases, Nigeria lost more persons to cholera in 2021 than it has to COVID-19 since early 2020. But despite the startling statistic, communities worst hit by cholera are struggling to respond to the disease, mostly due to state and federal government\u2019s failure to equip them with the necessary resources. According to findings by TheCable\u2019s JAMES OJO, residents are still living in unsanitary conditions, bereft of access to clean and safe water \u2014 even as the outbreak lingers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has been seven months since Safiya Mohammed lost her first child, Jamilu, to cholera but the pain is still as fresh as the day he died in May 2021 in Gaya LGA of Kano.\n\n\u201cHe already paid the bride price of his fianc\u00e9e and was in the process of finalising the marriage before he passed away,\u201d she said of 32-year-old Jamilu who was the backbone of the family.\n\nIn faraway Bauchi state, Asiya Umar can also relate to such pain, only that she risks losing more. Wakili Umar, her husband, died of cholera earlier in the year and now, all she can think of is how best to keep her children safe from the disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has genuine reasons to be afraid: At a section of the unkempt building where she lives in Bakin Kura lies stagnant water accumulated from leaking roofs; beside it, there\u2019s a dirty, dimly-lit room housing an uncovered well where they fetch water for drinking and other domestic use; and just behind their kitchen is a pit latrine left open, oozing putrid stench with houseflies having a feast.\n\nThe story is not so different in many households in states worst hit by cholera across northern Nigeria.\n\nAmid a struggle to contain a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, TheCable found that many states are grappling to adequately respond to the outbreak of cholera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUNDERFUNDED AND OVERSTRETCHED: FIGHTING CHOLERA WITH A HELPLESS SYSTEM\n\nAt the general hospital in Warji LGA of Bauchi, an official in charge of the outpatient department (OPD), who is addressed as Alarafe, was the centre of attention for many who had come for medical treatment. This reporter, posing as a patient with cholera symptoms, waited for more than three hours until it got to his turn to meet Alarafe.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get his (Alarafe\u2019s) attention easily like that, there\u2019s always a lot on him,\u201d said a trainee health official at the dilapidating hospital which also lacks water supply.\n\nWith 19,558 cases, Bauchi is the state worst hit by the cholera outbreak. And although the general hospital is an important facility for treating such diseases, the delay in getting assistance mirrors a common challenge \u2014 a dearth of health workers responding to the outbreak in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe hospital is in a terrible state,\u201d Haruna Abdulahi, a staff member, said. \u201cYou must have noticed that the environment was smelling when you entered. The staff is also small.\u201d\n\nFrom the general hospital and primary health centre (PHC) in Warji to the government facility in Kafi Madaki in Ganjuwa LGA, where more than 500 cases of cholera are said to have been treated, the conditions are similar: inadequate personnel, poor sanitation, and dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nAs is the case in Bauchi, several health facilities visited in Kano \u2014 the third most affected state in Nigeria with 12,116 cases \u2014 also lack sufficient resources to combat the cholera outbreak in the state.\n\nAt the general hospital in Sumaila \u2014 the LGA with the highest number of cases in Kano \u2014 Muhammad Abdullahi huffed and puffed as he sat close to his three-year-old daughter who was recently admitted. She needs urgent and proper medical attention but the ill-equipped cholera unit of the hospital is giving him little room for optimism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you look at where we isolate those with cholera cases, it is not convenient. It\u2019s just a shade instead of a proper building,\u201d said Aminu Ibrahim Gala, the administrative secretary of the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe need equipment, drugs, and other materials because a lot of the cholera patients are suffering,\u201d he lamented. \u201cBefore cholera started, we were buying a litre of IV fluids less than N500 but since the outbreak, it\u2019s more than N2,000 and you can\u2019t get it easily unless you visit black markets.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the lack of manpower and poor infrastructure in several health facilities visited by TheCable, access to healthcare is also a challenge in some communities \u2013 typical of Nigeria\u2019s health sector over the years.\n\nIn spite of many strikes embarked upon by health workers \u2013 often to protest issues such as poor welfare and inadequate funding \u2014 the sector still suffers with the government often failing to walk its talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, has failed to reach the 15 percent allocation of the annual federal government budget to the health sector \u2014 20 years after the African Union (AU) members jointly made the resolution at a summit in Abuja. The country\u2019s highest allocation to the health sector has been seven percent, which is a far cry from the 2001 declaration.\n\nApart from inadequate manpower and poor welfare of the health workforce, communities struggling to contain the cholera outbreak are littered with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) projects \u2013 a key component in NCDC\u2019s response strategy to the disease. But most of the projects were either abandoned before completion or have stopped functioning.\n\nAcross Bauchi, Warji, and Ganjuma LGAs in Bauchi state, residents live in unhygienic conditions while some of the WASH projects that could have helped tackle the outbreak are mostly not operational.\n\nAt Marji Tuya district in Warji LGA, for instance, residents find it difficult to get clean and safe water, but ironically, at the heart of the area is a motorised borehole project being taken over by bush, just like another tagged \u2018Hygiene, Sanitation Facility, and Solar Borehole\u2019 in Kafin Madaki, Ganjuwa LGA.\n\nIn Kano as well, a number of WASH projects initiated by the state and federal governments are rotting away, including a solar-powered borehole at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) sponsored by Ibrahim Shekarau, the lawmaker representing Kano Central at the senate.\n\nThe ripple effects leave a sour taste in the mouth: In Sumaila LGA in Kano, \u201chuman beings and cattle drink from untreated dams in some communities,\u201d said Auwalu Mohammad, a resident of the area.",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween January and September 2021, African fintechs raised up to $1.4 billion, signalling an increasing investor appetite for Africa\u2019s growing fintech space, and Nigeria has taken centre stage.\n\nWhen Paystack and Flutterwave launched in 2016, it was a massive game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s financial sector, enabling thousands of other businesses to receive payments for their services.\n\nSince then, each year has presented an interesting trend as people look to plug different perceived gaps in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Intelligence by Techpoint, Nigerian fintech startups raised almost $800 million in 2021. This was 120% higher than what fintechs raised in the last three years combined ($360.7 million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, it took the lion\u2019s share of funding across sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this success, our analysis showed that fintechs were merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Africa. But, so far, there\u2019ve been massive improvements in the fintech space beyond smartphone apps.\n\nLooking back at 2021, we touch on some notable points, and, once again, we had the honour of discussing the space with Adedeji Olowe, Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nIn January 2021, Olowe made some interesting predictions which, in the real sense, are educated guesses based on the trends from past years, and we created a little analysis.\n\nInterestingly, some predictions came to pass, reminding us that no one sees the future. At least, we haven\u2019t met anyone who does, have you?\n\nWhat did not happen?\n\nVisa and Mastercard to acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, we placed what was perhaps the most daring and exciting prediction front and centre in our analysis of Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions. Visa could acquire Interswitch with Mastercard responding by acquiring eTranzact.\n\nThis obviously did not happen, but several building blocks are in place to make it possible.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Visa invested $200 million in Interswitch, making one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech companies a full-fledged Unicorn. That investment brought several conversations about Visa\u2019s play for the Nigerian market, and that of its biggest competition, Mastercard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth companies have invested in many Nigerian fintechs, most notably Paystack and Flutterwave, and seemingly took their battle for market share to Africa\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cI made the prediction because I think it made perfect sense for both companies to go through that route, and I think it\u2019s still a possibility in the future,\u201d says Olowe.\n\nMajor banks to implement free transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest selling points Digital banks like Kuda have used to take the market by storm is free transfers. Unfortunately, no major bank took up the gauntlet to implement free bank transfers in 2021.\n\nAccording to Olowe, giving free transfers for transactions below a certain amount would greatly aid Nigeria\u2019s drive for a cashless society. This, he says, would bring in several people performing low-value transactions daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something the CBN should push for. Over 20 years ago, a SIM card cost \u20a620,000, but now it\u2019s completely free. Today, some people don\u2019t mind buying \u20a650 recharge cards ten times in a day, but tell them to load \u20a6500 at once,\u201d he states.\n\nOlowe believes that once a cap is set, it would be very helpful and will not be abused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling people to send their own hard-earned money. Even if it\u2019s free, It won\u2019t be so easy. If the accounts are linked with the BVN, then it would be easier to catch those who might want to abuse the policy,\u201d he argues.\n\nCould we see another game-changing CBN circular soon? Let\u2019s watch out.\n\nMonthly inter-bank transactions to hit $500 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fintech stalwarts tout Nigeria\u2019s payment sector as one of the fastest globally. This was made possible by the introduction of the NIBSS Instant Payment by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System. This speed, as well as several other factors like increasing Internet penetration, has increased monthly inter-bank transactions in recent years.\n\nAs of December 2020, the numbers had almost hit $300 million, but so far, in 2021, it hasn\u2019t come close to $500 million.\n\nAccording to data from the NIBSS, the average monthly inter-bank transactions stayed a little over $250 million for the better part of 2021, finally crossing $300 million in October and November.\n\n\u201cTransactions will likely go up during the festive season, but I doubt it will hit $400 million.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that free inter-bank transfers could encourage more inter-bank transactions, but it might not always be so straightforward. Let\u2019s watch out for any triggers in 2022.\n\nWhatsApp to make a payment play in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, all it would have taken was a virtual account attached to every WhatsApp number, and that would have been a game-changer, Olowe opined in January 2021. However, WhatsApp payment struggled to lift off during the year.\n\nIts launch in Brazil met with stiff opposition, and regulatory parties all but quelled any traction it plans to gain. However, the team at Meta-owned WhatsApp is not deterred, and it announced a relaunch in Brazil and testing in the United States in December 2021.\n\nOlowe believes they\u2019re not out yet, stating that future developments would most likely tie in with Meta\u2019s recent crypto play.\n\nImagine being able to make transactions from a crypto wallet in your WhatsApp account. That would be something, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSignificant progress\n\nThe growth and relevance of agency banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency banking burst onto the scene in 2020 with the reported successes of OPay and TeamApt. In 2021, it grew to unprecedented levels as more players like Kudi and Paga began to show immense growth in Agency banking services.\n\nOlowe predicted that Agency banking locations would surpass one million. Though we tried collating data from different players, this could amount to double-counting as most agents are company agnostic. So we\u2019ll try to lay our hands on official data.\n\nIn January, Olowe argued that if KYC issues were resolved, most agents would be able to perform services such as offering loans, customer KYC verification, e-commerce deliveries, and other non-cash transactions.\n\nThis idea has not been fully realised, but some of the players in the space have made some significant strides.\n\nTeamApt, OPay, and Paga, for example, offer bill payments and other social services, but a little talked about company, Kudi, has struck some interesting initiatives.\n\nIn August 2021, it revealed a partnership with Aella App and Reliance HMO to allow customers access loans and health insurance through their network of agents.\n\nYou see, mobile money providers do not have the licence to provide loans or insurance, but that\u2019s where Aella comes in to provide loans to customers, and Reliance comes in for health insurance.\n\nAccording to Nifemi Akinwamide, Head of Marketing at Kudi, the goal is to bring millions of Nigerians who are offline into the financial market, and such a partnership would help Aella and Reliance reach thousands of people who do not have smartphones.\n\nThis deserves a closer look, and its success might help make this prediction get a more favourable outcome in 2022\n\nWhat happened\n\nMTN finally got its PSB licence\n\nIn January, Olowe stated that MTN would finally get its PSB licence, and he based his prediction on the fact that Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO, who has a history of execution, would make it happen.\n\nAt the MTN anniversary event, we tried getting some juice from Toriola, but he simply stated that the company had completed all the requirements and was waiting for the CBN\u2019S final decision.\n\nIn November 2021, MTN and Airtel finally received approval in principle (AIP) to operate as a payment service bank in Nigeria. They joined 9mobile and Glo that got the AIP in 2019.\n\nWhile a telco-driven mobile money operation has worked wonders in Kenya and Ghana, it has not hit the mark in Nigeria.\n\nMost mobile money providers use PoS machines that require cards and mainly deal with cash, but a telco-led mobile money could make things completely cashless.\n\n\u201cAn AIP gives many financial institutions the power to operate fully. They\u2019re basically telling you to put actions behind all you\u2019ve been boasting that your company would do. They\u2019ll then come back in a few years to see that everything is functioning well.\n\n\u201cI must admit that MTN would find it really tough to play in the financial space. They would have two regulators, the NCC and the CBN, and would experience what banks and other fintechs have been facing in the space,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHowever, he also insists that MTN has a track record of execution, and they would come with the right strategy to take the market.\n\nMTN is the largest telecom company in terms of network coverage, voice subscribers, and Internet subscribers, and the launch of its PSB could bode well for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nVirtual accounts are coming of age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe predicted that virtual accounts, led by innovators from TeamApt, Rubies, Zenith, Sterling, Wema, and Sparkle would become increasingly popular.\n\nSo far, most of these fintech companies have led the charge as predicted, but not without a few hiccups.\n\nWhen the CBN banned crypto transactions in March 2021, it placed sanctions on Providus Bank, which enabled virtual accounts for several fintech companies playing in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, the issues have since been resolved, and Olowe states that activities have resurged to the levels attained just before the crypto ban.\n\nLocal investors are stepping up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from previous years showed that foreign investments have dominated funding for Nigerian startups, and Olowe predicted that this would change with the FOMO caused by Paystack\u2019s acquisition in 2020.\n\nRecall that Stripe acquired Paystack in 2020 for $200 million, a truly momentous milestone for Africa\u2019s startup scene.\n\nIn 2021, there\u2019s been a massive improvement in the participation of local investors, but differently than expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that several Nigerian investors don\u2019t really understand the business of startups. They think it\u2019s just, \u2018Put your money and expect constant returns.\u2019 What we\u2019re now seeing is startup founders who truly understand the space funding upcoming founders,\u201d Olowe points out.\n\nRecent funding rounds have featured the likes of GB, Flutterwave CEO; Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, Paystack\u2019s Co-founders; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO, and other notable names.\n\nOlowe, however, maintains that Nigeria has boasted a good number of local investors in recent years. Most notable are Gbenga Oyebode, Founder of Aluko and Oyebode, one of MTN\u2019s first supporters in Nigeria.\n\nOther names like Idris Ayobello and Olumide Soyombo also warrant significant mention.\n\nAccording to Olowe, the successes of three investors has created FOMO among their peers who are getting more interested in the startup space.\n\nIt was a bright year for fintech companies and a year of Unicorns. What do you expect to see in 2022? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "In New Year message, Buhari promises to seek support to tackle insecurity",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would seek collaboration with international partners and neighboring countries by exploring diverse strategies at addressing security at the grassroots to check the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nBuhari stated this Saturday during his 2022 New Year broadcast to Nigerians, saying though his administration had made significant gains against insurgence, he was aware of the challenge ahead.\n\nThe President said the spate of insecurity in certain parts of the country had derailed gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy in recent times.\n\nHe promised that his administration would leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while the diversification of the economy is expected to aid the emergence of other sectors.\n\n\u201cTo this end, working with our international partners and neighboring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nRead Also: Buhari\u2019s 2022 New Year message to the nation\n\n\u201cOur Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nPresident Buhari has received constant criticism over his administration\u2019s failure to address the worsening insecurity in the country, check spate of killings and kidnapping which has become a daily affair.\n\nLast week, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan Kukah, in his 2021 Christmas Message titled, \u2018A Nation Still In Search of Truth & Vindication\u2019, said the President owes Nigerians explanations as to the rising kidnappings and killings in Nigeria.\n\nKukah noted that Buhari and his government must move quickly before Arewa, and the Northern part of the country descends into Arewanistan.\n\nAccording to the President, \u201cWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\n\u201cI salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n\u201cThe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n\u201cThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security \u201cApparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n\u201cThe net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n\u201cGovernment, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\n\u201cOnce again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n\u201cWe equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n\u201cOn the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n\u201cThe major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n\u201cJust like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the New Year.\n\n\u201cIn year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\n\u201cDespite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n\u201cAs we welcome 2022, let us, with hope; envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n\u201cAs it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch\u201d.",

          "title": "Apapa: An app breathes life into a \u2018Ghost town\u2019, limits extortions",
          "text": "The network of bridges in Apapa can be felt vibrating for a few seconds every few minutes while walking across or inside a stationary vehicle. The vibration is caused whenever trucks move, rather, crawl through the long bridges, either on their way to or from the ports, a journey that up until January 2021, took an average of three weeks, instead of a few hours. For years, hundreds of cargo-bearing trucks would line up for hours on the fragile bridges, getting only occasional \u2018expansion joint repairs\u2019 to avoid collapse.\n\nShipping a 40-foot container from China to the Apapa Port could cost N500,000 for the 10,540-kilometre voyage, but taking the same out of Apapa to Sango-Ota in Ogun state, cost N1 million as of 2020 for a distance of 38 kilometres.\n\nDubbed Nigeria\u2019s premier port, Apapa as a community was an enclave for elites several years ago. Expatriates and other high net worth individuals favoured it, but as order and sanity gave way to pollution, traffic congestions, and crime, those who had built their lives around the port-city gradually voted with their feet, and businesses followed suit.\n\n\u201cThere are people feeding fat from the fact that there is traffic, but now, it is affecting the generality of businesses,\u201d Paul Odey, general manager/CEO of Apapa GRA Residents\u2019 Association as at 2016 had told this reporter. \u201cApapa is more than fuel and containers as there are a lot of other businesses. We only have those two businesses surviving while everything else is dying.\u201d\n\nThis has come at a cost to the Nigerian economy. As reported by BusinessDay, a report by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) noted Nigeria loses N600 billion in Customs revenue annually, including $10 billion in non-oil export sector and N2.5 trillion in corporate earnings across various sectors due to the poor state of Nigerian ports. The congestion in Apapa meant government was losing, businesses were losing but the ultimate winners were security agents and street urchins in charge of extortions at multiple checkpoints.\n\nWhile an estimated 5,000 trucks seek access to Apapa and Tin Can ports in Lagos every day, the two ports can only accommodate 1,500 trucks, according to the LCCI. To get ahead of the queue is where things get interesting and miserable at the same time.\n\nInteresting when the magnitude of extortion, with its dramatic twists is explored, yet, miserable, when the impact of all these on the immediate economy of Apapa is considered, and even the wider Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cWe even used to gamble and pay as much as N300,000 to pass our trucks into the port,\u201d said Bala Mohammed, who owns a fleet of trucks. \u201cBy the time you access the road around a place like Eleganza, that is when they will turn your driver back, sometimes beat him and even damage the truck, and the person you paid money to will be unreachable. There is nothing you can do as the money is gone.\u201d\n\nAs different \u2018movers\u2019 are used to facilitate the movement of trucks, it could be a civilian with influence in the port-city or one of the several military officers deployed to \u2018maintain traffic\u2019. If money was paid to a uniformed personnel, and a truck still could not access the ports, they would often threaten to \u2018deal with\u2019 with the truck owner when such person calls to lament, according to Mohammed.\n\nThe gridlock, much of which was artificially created because of roadblocks where trucks were extorted, made commuting in and out of Apapa a hellish experience. With the usual Lagos traffic, while this reporter could for instance commute for 17 kilometres from Ikeja to the entrance of Apapa Bridge at Iponri within 45-minutes, the remaining 4 kilometres to Point road where BusinessDay is located could take an average of 3 hours depending on how fast the trucks move. The impact affected both individuals and businesses.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, an interview conducted by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) on critical challenges facing the sector, showed 94 percent of the CEOs had said congestion at the ports had a significantly negative effect on their productivity and cost of production.\n\n\u201cMost worrisome are the issues of deliberate delay in cargo clearing time, raising of technical barriers, rejection of relevant documents by officers of the agency that approved import documents, multiple agencies with duplicated functions and other rent-seeking activities of vested interests at the port that excessively fleece operators,\u201d they said.\n\nRead also: National Development Plan 2021-2025 will spur robust growth \u2013 APC\n\nEven at the point of entering the port after spending two weeks (on the road), and paying at multiple checkpoints, Mohammed explained that a truck could still be turned back. \u201cWe have multiple cabals, so if the mover you pay doesn\u2019t share the money to all the checkpoints, once you get to a particular checkpoint, they will ask your driver \u2018how far?\u2019 If the mover is not there or the driver doesn\u2019t know the code to clear his truck, they will turn him back,\u201d he said.\n\nEven though truckers like Mohammed no longer spend as much as N300,000 to access the ports, multiple checkpoints remain sources of extortion, and they still spend up to N30,000 per trip\n\nTechnology to the rescue?\n\nAfter a decade of what appeared to be a hopeless situation, the introduction of an electronic call-up system known as Eto App by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and its technical partner, the Trucks Transit Parks Ltd (TTP) in February 2021, was welcomed with cautious optimism.\n\nA Presidential taskforce, the Police, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), the Nigerian Army, and the Nigerian Navy had at different times failed to curb the traffic gridlock in Apapa. To observers, it was doubtful that a mobile app, which could also be accessed through web browsers, would fix the situation.\n\nFive months into the deployment of the electronic call-up system, the cost of transporting containers from Apapa and Tin-Can Ports to importers\u2019 warehouses in Lagos, started declining and currently, has dropped by 75 percent on a year-on-year basis, from N1, 600,000 to N400, 000, according to BusinessDay\u2019s findings.\n\nIn addition, the amount paid to shipping companies by cargo owners as demurrage for delay in taking delivery of their consignments has also reduced, since the minimum two-week delay that came with congestion on port roads has been eliminated for now, and hopefully, permanently.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant improvement in terms of access to the ports without much stress or having to pay camp boys, cabals, movers, etc the sum of N250 or up to N300 thousand without any assurance of getting to the port,\u201d said Mohammed, who has about 40 trucks already registered on the tech platform.\n\nThe Eto App, is used in generating electronic call-ups for trucks, and it has enabled better control and management of port bound trucks. With its introduction, there has been relief for port users, motorists, and Apapa residents from the pains of a decade-old traffic congestion in the entire local government area.\n\nAs BusinessDay learnt, fleet owners can register multiple trucks under a single account for either export or import. From the app, they can schedule any truck going to the ports, pay the required fees only and with this, the need to have multiple trucks competing for the roads appears to have been solved.\n\nOnce a truck enters the satellite park, they would be booked into the park through the Eto platform, following which the system would batch the truck under 24 hours. If the truck is batched to leave the satellite park, on the same day, it moves to the pre-gate and from there depending on traffic, can be batched out within two days. There are times the process can be completed within 24 hours and a truck would access the port, while in the past, the process took at least 2 weeks.\n\nOnce a truck is issued a call up ticket from the gate, it is supposed to move straight to the port without any interference, but with multiple checkpoints cropping out, the automation system is being affected.\n\nThis is because once 100 trucks are released from \u2018pre-gate\u2019, after one or two hours, another batch of 100 trucks are expected to be released but as multiple checkpoints cause delays, trucks could gradually build up on the roads.\n\n\u201cFrom Apapa to Ikeja we are now loading for N150,000 to N170,000 which used to cost N500,000 to N1 million before the coming of Eto App,\u201d said Mohammed, highlighting the impact of the technology on the haulage business.\n\nTraces of extortion persist\n\nEven though truckers like Mohammed no longer spend as much as N300,000 to access the ports, multiple checkpoints remain sources of extortion, and they still spend up to N30,000 per trip. A fraction of what was paid before, but still extortion.\n\nMultiple checkpoints, which according to him are illegally mounted by some policemen, joint task teams like LASTMA, FRSC, and NPA, sometime insist drivers \u2018give them something\u2019, despite having an Eto ticket.\n\nRecalling an experience earlier this week, one of his trucks was coming from Ijora-Olopa, and the driver had a valid Eto ticket but a policeman stopped him, demanding for N2,000.\n\n\u201cI spoke to the officer and told him the driver is having a valid Eto ticket that qualifies him to access the ports without any interference, and he replied that the Eto ticket is not for him, as long as he is on the road,\u201d Mohammed recounts.\n\nThis, he says, highlights the kind of entitlement mentality by uniformed personnel, who remain adamant that if not given money, trucks will not pass. \u201cIf you call the area commander or superior police officer, he will tell you that they are not aware and that they did not send those people to do such, yet we have made complaints several times but those people on the field refuse to change their attitude,\u201d he says.\n\nThe multiple checkpoints affect not only truckers, but also the automation system, which should not have human interference.\n\nFrom Ijora-Olopa, security agents are said to demand N2000 or sometimes N5000 per checkpoint, on the bridge they ask for as much as N1500, and all of these add up to N30,000 or N50,000 to load a job of N150,000.\n\nBusinessDay learnt there are some drivers who know their rights, fight for it and will pass through without paying bribes. There is another twist to those who fight for their rights. When security agents trying to extort a truck driver see such a person is unyielding, they could tell them to park somewhere and let other trucks pass. The moment the driver agrees to park the truck, they call LASTMA officers to come and arrest the truck on the claim it has been \u2018wrongly parked\u2019. This would end up with the truck being towed away by LASTMA, which then imposes heftier fines on the truck. All of these, just to keep truck drivers pliant and to keep paying bribes, which the Eto App should have eliminated completely.",
          "summary": "Shipping a 40-foot container from China to the Apapa Port could cost N500,000 for the 10,540-kilometre voyage, but taking the same out of Apapa to Sango-Ota in Ogun state, cost N1 million as of 2020 for a distance of 38 kilometres.\nDubbed Nigeria\u2019s premier port, Apapa as a community was an enclave for elites several years ago.\nThe congestion in Apapa meant government was losing, businesses were losing but the ultimate winners were security agents and street urchins in charge of extortions at multiple checkpoints.\nAs BusinessDay learnt, fleet owners can register multiple trucks under a single account for either export or import.\nThe multiple checkpoints affect not only truckers, but also the automation system, which should not have human interference.",

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

          "title": "For the Record: Text of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s New Year Speech",
          "text": "PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI\u2019S STATEMENT TO THE NATION ON JANUARY 1, 2022\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\n2. I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n3. The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n4. The path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n5. There is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n6. The net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n7. Government, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\n8. Once again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n9. We equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n10. We remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n11. On the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n12. The major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n13. We may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n14. Despite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n15. On August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n16. Just like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n17. In year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n18. We have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n19. In the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\n20. Despite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n21. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n22. As it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\n23. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

Whatever economic challenges may confront us as a government, we shall continue to be resilient and consolidate on our financial ingenuity to survive any inclement economic climate and continue to deliver on all promises made.\n\n\u201cAs I wish you all the very best that this year will bring, I promise to rededicate myself to the social contract with you, the good people of Osun\u201d, Oyetola said.",

          "title": "Shisha: The Irresistible Lethal Killer Wrapped In Flavour",
          "text": "Few months ago, five female pupils of the Oreyo Senior Grammar School, Igbogbo, Ikorodu area of the State, was caught in a video expertly smoking \u201cShisha\u201d while in school uniform. The trending video simply sends a message to the spine of Nigerians, parents, guardians and school authorities and the government of the looming shisha pandemic in the country, where the dream of most teenagers in the country is to have a feel of shisha smoke.\n\nSoon after the video went viral on the internet, the state government, through the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Youth and Social Development, described the act as heart-wrenching and also sent the girls on rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cThe appropriate ministry is already intervening. You see why the role of parents is so critical. We can\u2019t leave everything to the government and school. This is heart wrenching,\u201d he said.\n\nTruth must be told, the lust for shisha is hardly a joke in modern Nigeria as young Nigerians, mostly teenagers, plummet into addicts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor some young girls even as low as 13 years old, smoking shisha is always a thing to try after discussion with their peers and they don\u2019t care going any length to have a feel of it.\n\nAmid warnings from global health bodies like World Health Organisation (WHO), young smokers are not deterred. A single hookah is enough for a group of 10 to smoke tobacco to their satisfaction. Some smokers claim shisha is good to keep the body warm during the cold. But in all weathers, the smoking instrument is not far away from teenage-smokers in Nigeria.\n\nA shisha is a water pipe used to smoke tobacco. It is also called a hookah, hubble-bubble and narghile. The word \u201chookah\u201d refers to the pipe, not the content of the pipe. It was invented hundreds of years ago in the Middle East. Today, hookah smoking is also popular in the United States, Europe, Russia, and around the world.\n\nAccording to WHO, the volume of smoke inhaled in an hour-long shisha session is estimated to be equivalent to smoking between 100 and 200 cigarettes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFirstly, the top two most common reasons for smoking shisha LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered were: \u201cno specific reason, shisha is trendy\u201d \u201cI want to have a feel of it\u201d , implying shisha is gaining popularity among nightclub patrons and flavour. It appears that shisha smoking has become a contextual norm in nightclubs in Nigeria. The trend cuts across adolescents and the older population in restaurants and hotels and at social gatherings.\n\nFindings show that to the surprise of many, shisha smokers are not limited to men as female teenagers including undergraduates also engage in it.\n\nRecent findings in Abuja, Kaduna, Kano, Anambra, Benin, Ekiti, Sokoto, Benue, Borno, Plateau, Lagos, and Ogun states reveal a high incidence of addiction among the youth. The relative cheapness and accessibility to the shisha items make it easy for the youth to acquire them.\n\nFor instance, a small pack of fruit-flavoured tobacco sells at N500 or more depending on the point of purchase, while the cost of smoking shisha at a bar ranges from N1,000 to N20,000 depending on the location and associative drugs used to spice the stash.\n\nWhen this reporter visited a lounge where he disguised as a customer at Equinox Abacha road, Nasarawa state, 15 kilometers to the city centre in Abuja, it was gathered during the investigation many teenage girls with their boyfriends were seen patronising the place and taking Shisha.\n\nIt was also observed that users tend to expose themselves to dangerous diseases. It\u2019s a common trend in most nightclubs and shisha joints to see youth sharing shisha pots and pipes among five to even eight persons. The smoking equipment is rarely cleaned before being passed from one user to the other. That is very dangerous, users may contract deadly diseases in that manner.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking on why she cannot resist smoking shisha, Blessing Johnson noted she cannot resist smoking shisha as it gives her joy and she loves smoking it.\n\nWhen asked if she was aware of the medical implication of smoking shisha, she said she know someone, a friend who has never smoked in his life; he has never taken any alcohol, exercises well, drinks a lot of water, he doesn\u2019t go clubbing, if they say someone knows how to take care of himself, it is this friend. But he was diagnosed and sadly he has lung cancer.\n\n\u2018\u2019If I should die today. I believe that it is God\u2019s plan for my life. But I won\u2019t die now by God\u2019s grace,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nSpeaking to the Shisha don Samuel at Equinox Lounge, he said a mixture of shisha goes for N1,500.\n\nHe said the prices of shisha pots range from N10, 000 to N75, 000 depending on the source.\n\nSamuel said the imported pots are more expensive, stressing that this is because they depict class and sophistication of the user.\n\nA medical practitioner at Rehoboth Hospital, Dr. Sanni Abdullahi while speaking to LEADERSHIP Weekend decried that shisha smoking has emerged as a prevalent public health issue in Nigeria.\n\nHe said contrary to the general belief, uranium that is inhaled will most likely damage your kidneys rather than your lungs. Dr. Abdullahi said there is a need for an immediate response from policy providers towards shisha smoking intervention in Nigeria.\n\nDr. Abdullahi said shisha does damage the respiratory tract, creates respiratory irritation and accumulation of fluid in the lungs as well. He noted that people smoked shisha for much longer than they smoked a cigarette, adding that with one puff, shisha smokers inhaled the same amount of smoke as they got from a whole cigarette.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019Shisha smoking is gaining increasing acceptance and appeal all over the world; Shisha smoking is generally perceived as less harmful than cigarette smoking and it is more prevalent among older men and younger women this is not true.\n\n\u2018\u2019The lust for shisha is hardly a joke in modern Nigeria. The discussion about the glass-bottomed water pipe in which fruit-flavoured tobacco is coated with foil and heated with charcoal makes it more highly resistible.\n\n\u2018\u2019Teenagers who smoke hookah are being influenced by people who are supposed to guide them. It is now everywhere on campuses today. We even have hookah competitions, where people in various schools post on social media their pictures on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. They even compare the thickness of the smoke. This is the reality of the menace in our society. We need to strategic move to end this scourge.\u2019\u2019\n\nUnlike cigarette smoking, statistics show that there is no gender or age difference in the rate of shisha smoking.\n\nHowever, findings show that shisha smoking is now rampant and addicted users have graduated from visiting nightclubs and shisha cafes to ownership of shisha paraphernalia in their homes.\n\nA report published by the Pan African Medical Journal, entitled: Shisha smoking in selected nightclubs in Nigeria\u2019\u2019 shows that shisha smoking is prevalent in nightclubs and has peculiar demographic correlates different from cigarette smoking. Although men were more likely to be regular users, the early age at initiation into use in women is an important epidemiological finding, especially regarding their reproductive health.\n\nThe report noted that the \u2018\u2019high prevalence of shisha smoking in our sample is also a major public health issue, given our findings that none of the shisha smokers were ready to quit and also considering that the majority of the users were high-level professionals in their productive stage of life.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our findings call for an immediate public health response from policy providers towards shisha smoking intervention in Nigeria.\n\nThe report found that men were significantly more frequent Shisha smokers than women, despite the lack of significant gender differences in the overall prevalence of shisha use in the past three months.\n\nIt said there are indications of an alarmingly high rate of shisha use among both men and women in some Arab countries and frequent shisha smoking is found in nightclubs, where it is often consumed along with alcohol.\n\n\u2018\u2019Nevertheless, despite the frequent use of shisha among these nightclub patrons, there was a general lack of readiness to quit using it, irrespective of gender. This finding is similar to reports of studies carried out in some other parts of the world. It is possible that the general misconception that shisha is not hazardous could be responsible for this finding. Shisha smokers usually believe that it is less harmful than cigarettes because the smoke is filtered through water.\n\n\u2018\u2019This misconception may be reinforced by marketing tools and social pressures. Unlike cigarette packaging, which carries mandatory health warnings, shisha products are commonly sold with no such health warnings. Labels on shisha packs claim their product is \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cfree of chemicals\u201d and powered by inviting varieties of flavours, suggesting there is a risk for continued use and exploration by non-users.\n\n\u2018\u2019This has huge public health implications and carries an additional risk for women with regard to their reproductive health and is particularly pertinent considering our finding that significantly more women compared with men reported \u201cflavour\u201d as their commonest reason for shisha use and also that a significantly higher proportion of women had a younger age of initiation into use than men,\u2019\u2019 the report added.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), up to 17 percent of high school senior boys and 15 percent of high school senior girls have used a hookah.\n\nThe CDC notes that hookah smoking is slightly higher among college students, with about 22 percent to 40 percent having tried it. This might be because it\u2019s typically a group event and done in special cafes, tea houses, or lounges.\n\nA hookah is made up of a rubber hose, pipe, bowl, and smoke chamber. Tobacco is heated on coals or charcoal, and it may have flavors added to it, like apple, mint, licorice, or chocolate.\n\nA common myth is that hookah smoking is safer than cigarette smoking. This isn\u2019t true. Hookah smoking won\u2019t get you high, but it does have other health risks and can be addictive.",

Dr Alfred Adewale Martins has enjoined Nigerians to be optimistic and to embrace a positive mind-set as they enter the New Year 2022, filled with renewed trust in God Almighty.\n\nIn his New Year message signed by the Director of Social Communications, Rev. Fr. Anthony Godonu, the prelate admitted that there were indeed numerous challenges that characterized the outgoing year for the country as a whole and for majority of Nigerians. He, however, urged Nigerians to look beyond the shortfalls and negatives of the past and approach the New Year with optimism and positive expectations.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to shun every attempt to create fear and apprehension by the predictions of doom that are being circulated in the social media space. He counselled that we should simply be full of prayers, committing all our experiences to God rather than dwell on such predictions that can only lead to depression and further mental anguish.\n\n\u201cWe thank the good Lord for making it possible for us to see the New Year. As we celebrate, let us remember our brothers and sisters who passed on during the year, thereby ending their earthly journey. We pray that their souls find lasting peace with God.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLet us remember the admonition of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace to us: not to fret or fear over tomorrow, but to live with the courage and belief that each day is in the hands of God, and He has the blueprint by which He will make our lives better in the coming year. On our part, we must do that which is right and good towards our neighbours, living in peace and harmony with everyone. We must not allow the predictions of doom and other challenges that we face to lead us question the presence of God even in our circumstances.

          "title": "SEVEN TIPS on: 2022 NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS AROUND THE WORLD",
          "text": "GREGORIAN NEW YEAR (MOST OF THE WORLD)\n\nJanuary 1st is when most of the world\u2019s governments and business institutions recognize the beginning of the New Year. This is largely due to the Gregorian calendar\u2019s adaptation across Europe and the Americas about 250 years ago, and the subsequent emergence of the Western powers setting the stage for the global marketplace.\n\nHIJRI NEW YEAR \u2013 ISLAMIC NEW YEAR (2.4 BILLION)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Islam, the first year was 610 AD, when Muhammad traveled from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijra. However, the Islamic year is about 11-12 days shorter than a Gregorian year, which means that the Hijri just passed on Nov. 14-15 for the year 1435 AH. Part of the reason that the New Year shifts is due to when the moon is sighted, which means that the first day of the New Year could shift.\n\nROSH HASHANAH \u2013 JEWISH NEW YEAR (14 million)\n\nWhile there are many countries with a larger population than the entire Jewish faith combined, Judaism is still incredibly well-known and spread out everywhere. For this reason alone, it would be illogical not to mention the Jewish New Year \u2013 Rosh Hashanah, the first of the High Holy Days. Their New Year\u2019s Day is typically celebrated in the fall, around the middle of September.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCHINESE NEW YEAR (1.3 billion)\n\nThe Chinese New Year has set the standard for many nations in the Far East for millennia. A lunisolar calendar, the beginning of the New Year is never the same, and can vary up to almost a month between January and February. But once that day hits, there are about 15 days of celebration.\n\nSONGKRAN (115 million)\n\nCelebrated April 13-15, the Songkran Festival marks the New Year for not only Thailand, but for many Southeast and Southern Asian countries including Cambodia, Laos, and Burma. While Thailand officially recognizes the Gregorian New Year as the start of the new calendar year, the Songkran Festival marks the traditional Thai New Year, observed as a civic holiday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNOWRUZ (300 MILLION)\n\nThe \u201cNew Day\u201d (in Syrian) is celebrated through many Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Afghanistan, to name a few. Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster, and has been celebrated by the Persian peoples since at least the 2nd Century AD, though some records could indicate it was celebrated about half a millennium earlier. This New Year\u2019s Day shifts yearly, based on the March equinox, marking the day when the hours of night and day are roughly equivalent.\n\nHINDU/INDIAN NEW YEAR (.9-1.2 billion)\n\nIndia is not completely comprised of people of the Hindu faith, and not all areas of India celebrate the same New Year. Therefore, pinning down a specific new year\u2019s celebration for India and/or Hindu celebrations is problematic-at-best. That said, many of the different regions\u2019 and sects\u2019 celebrations revolve around the beginning of spring \u2013 usually around the middle of April.\n\nCulled From: www.toptenz.net",

          "text": "The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Malam Muhammad Musa Bello has commended residents for exhibiting the virtues of unity, tolerance and peaceful co-existence in the outgone 2021.\n\nIn his new year message issued on Saturday January 1, 2022, the Minister assured that the current administration remained committed to the wellbeing and welfare of Nigerians resident in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHe said so far, the FCT administration has made tremendous achievements in education, health, economy and other sectors of infrastructural development within the capital territory.\n\nBelow is his full New Year message obtained by Blueprint;\n\nNEW YEAR MESSAGE TO RESIDENTS OF THE FCT, BY THE HONOURABLE MINISTER, FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY, MALAM MUHAMMAD MUSA BELLO, JANUARY 1ST\n\n\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Capital Territory Administration it is my immense pleasure to wish all residents of the Federal Capital Territory a very happy and prosperous New Year\n\nAs we commence our journey into the year 2022, I wish to begin by congratulating and commending residents of the Territory, for living up to, and exhibiting the virtues of unity, tolerance and peaceful co-existence which are the ideals on which the FCT is founded.\n\n\n\nThe FCT Administration remains committed towards the wellbeing and welfare of every resident and our efforts at maintaining very high standards in the administration of the Territory yielded positive results in the preceding year.\n\n\n\nThis was manifest in the education sector with the establishment of 6 junior secondary schools, 6 primary schools and 11 senior secondary schools across the 6 Area Councils of the FCT.\n\n\n\nIt is equally worthy to mention that the principal of Government Secondary School Kubwa, Mr Nuhu Musa Zuru, was adjudged the best school administrator in Nigeria while a private school in the FCT, the Blooming Heritage School was adjudged the 3rd best private school in the country.\n\n\n\nEqually, students of the FCT School of Nursing scored a perfect 100% pass in the final Nursing Council examinations. These are pointers to the high academic and management standards of our academic institutions.\n\n\n\nOur health facilities remain some of the best in the country and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been exemplary, largely due to the dedication and commitment to duty of our frontline health personnel and I salute all of them.\n\n\n\nWe have not allowed the experience of the COVID-19 crisis go to waste as we have leveraged it to improve our health facilities including upgrading our hospitals and health centers and the establishment of a molecular diagnostic laboratory by the Ministerial Expert Advisory Committee.\n\n\n\nFellow residents, our efforts at repositioning the FCTA for better service delivery is yielding dividends as staff of the Administration have become more alive to their responsibilities and largely keyed into the public service reform agenda of the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari. To our credit, four of our staff bagged the 2021 Head of Service Award for Excellence.\n\n\n\nAlso, in 2021, the Administration was adjudged the best across the country in the Ethics, Integrity and Compliance Scorecard of the ICPC for the year 2020. We intend to continue along this path to rekindle public confidence in our institutions of governance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FCT is currently the second highest IGR earner amongst the sub nationals in the country. We are however convinced that we have the potentials to be the first, especially so as to augment allocations from the federation account which has been dwindling in the past years.\n\n\n\nThe creation of the Economic Planning, Revenue Generation and PPP Secretariat is intended to actualize our ambitions in this direction. We will continue to leverage our PPP options in the development of the city which has begun with the Land for Infrastructure Swap programme for the provision of world class city infrastructure in the Gwagwa District of the city.\n\n\n\nIt must however be mentioned that building a robust economy requires the active participation of the citizenry. While we are working hard to eliminate the issues of multiple taxation, I also implore residents to be exemplary citizens and perform their civic responsibilities by paying their taxes.\n\n\n\nYou all must admit that the preceding year was also quite challenging as the Territory experienced some unfortunate incidents, many of which were avoidable. These include the incidents of flooding caused largely by the flouting of development control regulations on construction, arson in a major business establishment and fire disasters at Kubwa market and just last week, the fire incident at Next Cash and Carry Supermarket.\n\n\n\nThe fire incident at Next Supermarket however, brought out the best of residents of the city as they rallied to salvage goods from the burning building. Their actions were heroic and selfless and should be emulated in all circumstances.\n\n\n\nWe also faced security challenges in some parts of Territory characterised by kidnapping and other violent crimes and in most cases the Security agencies have been able to solve the crimes and make arrests.\n\n\n\nI therefore wish to commend the efforts of our security agencies and military formations in keeping the Federal Capital Territory safe over the last 12 months.\n\n\n\nI must however remind residents that security is everyone\u2019s business. We must imbibe the spirit of saying something when we see anything or anyone suspicious.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, we have persevered and by the grace of God, we will also surmount other hurdles that we may encounter in future.\n\n\n\nFellow residents, the year 2022 will be a very politically active year, beginning with FCT Area Council elections which will take place in February, a little over a month from today.\n\n\n\nI call on you all to exercise your franchise by turning out to vote in these local government elections which are very crucial, as they represent the level of government that is closest to the people.\n\n\n\nActivities for the conduct of the 2023 general elections will also commence in earnest and I hereby enjoin all residents to please engage in these happenings in an atmosphere of peace, unity and togetherness for which the FCT is known.\n\n\n\nFellow residents, we have sadly, over the last few weeks witnessed a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 positive cases and fatalities in the FCT and around the country.\n\n\n\nI enjoin you, therefore to abide by all extant COVID-19 prevention protocols of hand washing, facial covering, physical distancing and vaccination. This is not the time to be complacent.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 testing and vaccination are available at designated health centers and strategic locations across the city at no cost.\n\n\n\nYou are enjoined to join the fight against this disease by making yourself available for testing and vaccination. That is the only way we can attain herd immunity and truly turn the tide against COVID-19.\n\n\n\nFellow residents, while thanking you all for your continuous prayers and sacrifices towards the development of FCT, we also solicit your continuous partnership and support in the New Year by maintaining the peace, and imbibing the virtues of peace, unity and care for each other in our collective quest of building the FCT of our dreams.\n\n\n\nOnce again, I wish you all a happy, peaceful and prosperous 2022.",

          "text": "\n\nThe Bishop of Anglican Communion, Kaduna Diocese, Timothy Yahaya, has urged Nigerian leaders to lead and carry out their duties to the people with fear of God, as they must render account to God.\n\nBishop Yahaya in a New Year message to Nigerians on Saturday, scored President Muhammadu Buhari zero on campaign promises he made in 2015 while running for the presidency, noting that fight against corruption, insecurity and economy where Buhari promised to bring sanity, are now worse than the President met them.\n\nThe cleric noted that the nation\u2019s leaders are behaving as if they are not accountable to the citizens, warning that no one can escape giving an account of stewardship before God on judgement day.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to lose hope, while predicting that there will be recovery and transformation in the New Year as God will show the people mercy.\n\nHe said, \u201cthey campaigned to stamp out corruption, but so far everybody on the street knows factually that there is corruption everywhere. They have not succeeded in fighting corruption. The fight against corruption should not be only when people have looted the country. What are we doing to nip corruption right from the desk it is found, right from where the contract will be awarded. So for me the fight against corruption has not even gone average.\n\n\u201cThe next campaign promise was security; when this government came to power we knew that the only part of the country that was seriously challenged security wise was the North East. But today can the Katsina people say they are experiencing security when the governor said the people should buy guns and defend themselves? Can the people in Sokoto where some travelers were burnt alive said there is security?.\n\n\u201cThe worrying thing is that when Nigerians are killed it becomes a number. It doesn\u2019t look like human beings. I expected that power-that-be should visit every scene that killings happened in this country to show how affectionate they are to the people. Can we calculate how many Army generals, not talking of soldiers that were killed in the last six years now, how many policemen were killed, how many Air Force men were killed.\n\n\u201cThe third pillar of their campaign in coming to office is the economy. How much was the naira to the dollar, how much was the pump price of petrol when they came to power, how much was the bag of rice? Let us also score the economy, and I want to pray that the year 2021 is gone with propaganda. But the year 2022 will be a year of reality, pragmatism and turn around for out great nation, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMy new year message to Nigerians is that there is still hope, in this year, we should not lose hope. In this year, there will be recovery and transformation. In this year, God will show us mercy. In this year, God will visit us in a special way. In this year, His grace will be sufficient for us. In this year, there will be peace in this country. As we call upon the Lord and depend upon Him, He shall restore our land to a place where there is peace and unity.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria has joined the rest of the world in ushering in 2022 after another tumultuous and pandemic-ridden year capped by soaring case numbers, insecurity, economic challenges, and a slight glimmer of hope for better times ahead.\n\nFrom fireworks cracking up in the air to worshippers in church to mark the crossover, many are optimistic that the coming year would provide a softer landing than 2021.\n\nReligious bodies such as the Christian Association of Nigeria had earlier called on citizens to pray for God\u2019s mercy in 2022.\n\nRead Also: World Rings In New Year Under COVID Cloud\n\nIn a New Year message signed on Friday by the CAN President Samson Ayokunle, the group said Nigerians irrespective of their religious affiliations should \u201ccry for the mercy of God\u201d that can preserve the nation and bring an end to all insecurity.\n\nAlso wishing citizens a happy new year, President Muhammadu Buhari urged them to envision a year of continued progress against the nation\u2019s combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n\u201cThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also called on the people, irrespective of their religious and political affiliation, to come together in the fight to keep the country united against all odds.\n\nHe admitted that the persistent insecurity in parts of the country may have threatened the overall objective of his administration to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress.\n\nPresident Buhari, however, assured that the government would remain resolute in its commitments and would continue to press ahead with its programmes and plans.\n\nMeanwhile, as the festivities are still ongoing, the Federal Government has declared January 3, 2022, as a public holiday in celebration of the New Year.\n\nElsewhere across the world, 2022 was ushered in with scaled-back celebrations due to new restrictions aimed at slowing soaring Covid cases \u2014 although hope remained for a better new year.\n\nThe past 12 months saw a new US president and a fresh Adele album, the first spectator-free Olympics, and dreams of democracy from Afghanistan to Sudan and Hong Kong crushed by authoritarian regimes.\n\nBut the pandemic \u2014 now entering its third year \u2014 still dominated life around the globe.\n\nMore than 5.4 million people have died since the coronavirus was first reported in central China in December 2019.\n\nCountless more have been sickened or subjected to outbreaks, lockdowns and a slew of virus tests.\n\nThe year 2021 started with hope as life-saving vaccines were rolled out to around 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population, although many of its poor still have limited access and some of its rich falsely believe the jabs are part of some ill-defined plot.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the emergence of the Omicron variant pushed the number of daily new Covid-19 cases past one million for the first time, according to an AFP tally.\n\nFrance on Friday became the latest country to announce Omicron was now its dominant coronavirus strain.\n\nIn Britain, the United States and even Australia \u2014 long a refuge from the pandemic \u2014 the variant\u2019s prominence is driving record new cases.\n\nTo Party, or Not?\n\nFrom Seoul to San Francisco, celebrations were again cancelled or curtailed in the face of the surge in infections.\n\nAbout 7,000 people in Madrid\u2019s Puerta del Sol \u2014 half the usual capacity due to Covid restrictions \u2014 rang in the new year by eating grapes, one for each time the clock chimed up to 12.\n\nThe glitzy Gulf city state of Dubai went ahead with its celebrations despite the surge in infections, with 36 firework displays at 29 locations.\n\nBut authorities warned they would fine anyone in attendance not wearing a protective mask.\n\nPolice officers patrolled the Champs-Elysees in Paris, lit with glittering red lights and festooned with \u201c2022\u201d balloons, also on the lookout for people without masks.\n\nMost people were simply asked to wear one, but some who argued were fined.\n\n\u201cIt is constraining to put on the mask\u2026 but it\u2019s no problem\u201d to follow the rule, said Antoine Pham, smiling. The 38-year-old and his partner came from Belgium to Paris for the evening.\n\nIn Sydney, which normally bills itself as the \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve capital of the world\u201d, the vast harbour where people gathered to watch the city\u2019s fireworks was notably uncrowded.\n\nWith tourists still unable to enter the country and many residents fearful of the rapid spread of Omicron, tens of thousands were estimated to have attended, rather than the usual one million-plus.\n\nStill, the city saw New Year\u2019s Eve in with a bang \u2014 igniting six tonnes of technicoloured fireworks that lit up the Opera House and floating barges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to focus on the positive things that happened this year,\u201d 22-year-old medical student Melinda Howard told AFP ahead of the show.\n\nIn Tunis, authorities cited the \u201crise in cases\u201d of coronavirus for the last-minute cancellation of festivities.\n\nIn contrast, South Africa \u2014 the first country to report Omicron back in November \u2014 lifted a curfew late Thursday to allow festivities to go ahead.\n\nHealth officials said that a dip in infections in the past week indicated the peak of the current wave had passed \u2014 crucially without a significant increase in deaths.\n\n\u2018This is Serious\u2019\n\nIn Rio, celebrations on Copacabana Beach went ahead in a scaled-back format, although crowds of revellers still arrived at the traditional party spot.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s festivities were cancelled due to Covid, it was a comparatively muted return for Rio, as health measures restricted the numbers of revellers to a fraction of the record three million people from two years ago.\n\nA ban on musical performances, traffic and public transport made for a more diluted atmosphere on the city\u2019s iconic beach.\n\n\u201cI was expecting many more people, and stress, but it\u2019s calm, I like it,\u201d saidColombian neuroscientist Alejandra Luna, 28, whose hope for 2022 is to \u201ckiss and cuddle without thinking much about it.\u201d\n\nIn Mexico City, authorities canceled a number of planned mass outdoor events, including a music concert on one of the capital\u2019s main boulevards, following an increase in coronavirus cases.\n\n\u201cHealth comes first and the cancellations are sending a kind of message that this is serious,\u201d Victor Arturo Madrid, a 59-year-old teacher, told AFP.\n\nTrying Times\n\nThe World Health Organization has warned of trying times ahead, saying Omicron could lead to \u201ca tsunami of cases\u201d.\n\nMany Western leaders have been hesitant to reimpose strict controls seen in 2020, for fear of sparking a new economic downturn.\n\nBut on-again-off-again restrictions have still prompted frequent, vocal and occasionally violent anti-lockdown, anti-vaccine and anti-government protests.\n\nUS President Joe Biden urged unity for the new year in a video message, during which he also praised \u201cextraordinary\u201d Americans.\n\n\u201cAs we head into 2022, I want folks to remember: There\u2019s not a single thing America cannot do when we do it together,\u201d he said on Twitter alongside the video.\n\nExperts and non-experts alike hope that 2022 may be remembered as a new, less deadly phase of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cHopefully 2022 is going to be better for everyone,\u201d said 31-year-old reveller Oscar Ramirez in Sydney.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the world needs a big change.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has asked Nigerians to envision a year of continued progress against the nation\u2019s combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nHe gave the charge on Friday in his New Year message to Nigerians to usher in the year 2022.\n\nThe President also urged the people, irrespective of their religious and political affiliation, to come together in the fight to keep the country united against all odds.\n\nREAD ALSO: World Ushers In 2022 After Another Pandemic-Ridden Year\n\nHe admitted that the persistent insecurity in parts of the country may have threatened the overall objective of his administration to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress.\n\nPresident Buhari, however, assured that the government would remain resolute in its commitments and would continue to press ahead with its programmes and plans.\n\nTo achieve this, he stressed that standing together against all odds, was by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to highlight some of the efforts made so far by his administration, and what Nigerians should expect in the areas of security, economy, and anti-corruption fight, among others.\n\nRead the full text of President Buhari\u2019s New Year message below:\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous nation of our dream.\n\n2. I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n3. The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n4. The path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n5. There is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n6. The net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n7. Government, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\n8. Once again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n9. We equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n10. We remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n11. On the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n12. The major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n13. We may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n14. Despite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n15. On August 16, 2021, I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n16. Just like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n17. In year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n18. We have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n19. In the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\n20. Despite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n21. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n22. As it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\n23. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria has called on Nigerians to pray for God\u2019s mercy in 2022.\n\nIn a New Year message signed on Friday by CAN President Samson Ayokunle, the group said Nigerians irrespective of their religious affiliations should \u201ccry for the mercy of God\u201d that can preserve the nation and bring an end to all insecurity.\n\n\u201cI call on all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious affiliations, to rise up and cry for the mercy of God that can preserve us and bring an end to all these pains. It appears as if our governments have got to their wit end over the menace of insecurity. Their major focus now is on the 2023 general election. Can the 2023 election happen if the nation is overrun by criminals? Our nation must survive first and be at peace before an election can take place.\n\n\u201cExcept for the mercy of God to intervene divinely and miraculously, we would be like Sodom and Gomorrah. It is only God who can make the 2023 general election a reality. It is only God in his own way who can teach our leaders the right step to take. It is only God who can send us help from above. Because of the desperate situation, we are in, some governors are already calling for self-defence and declaration of the state of emergency! This is unprecedented,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2022 Budget: Why Buhari Is Unhappy With Changes By NASS\n\nLooking back to the activities of 2021, Ayokunle said, \u201cGlory be to our God who helps us to escape all dangers and threats of the Year 2021 occasioned by the criminal activities of the bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and other unscrupulous elements amidst us.\u201d\n\n\u201c2021 was one year too many as a result of the ways and manners these criminals have been operating with impunity as if this is not the country, we have been all these years. It is as if they have taken over the country. They invade communities, markets, churches, and schools. They kill, maim, destroy, and kidnap without much resistance or hindrance.\n\n\u201cThey have turned our roads into death traps where they now kidnap for money, apparently due to the poor conditions of our roads and suddenly kidnapping has become a big business as the innocent people are being kidnapped and ransom in millions are being demanded and paid.\n\n\u201cFamilies of kidnapped people are at the mercy of the criminals! Some were not even fortunate as they were killed after the ransom has been paid! Our security agencies have been overstretched and the best done by our government is far from being enough if we must say the truth without deceiving ourselves. The Police have been parading the arrested kidnappers on the television but surprisingly, it appears as if they are too busy with their investigations to prosecute them!,\u201d the CAN President lamented.\n\nHe stressed further that the call for help from the developed world and the United Nations over rising insecurity got little attention as \u201cthey seem to be more occupied and busier with COVID-19 than pay attention to the daily destruction of lives going on in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe called on denominational and church leaders to use the opportunity of the New Year Fasting and Prayers programme of churches to rescue Nigeria from those who are hell-bent on destroying it by deliberately praying for the mercy of God over our unfortunate situation.\n\n\u201cFor the Lord, our God is a merciful God. He will not leave us or allow these heartless criminals to destroy us. We serve a God who is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.\n\n\u201cIt was in His mercy that He rescued the family of Noah against the Great Flood; He delivered Lot and his family in Sodom and Gomorrah shortly before the destruction of those cities. By his mercy, he delivered Israel from Egyptian captivity without Israel fighting any battle. The list of God\u2019s merciful intervention in human affairs is endless. That same God will surely have mercy on our country in Jesus\u2019 name,\u201d he said.\n\nHe prayed that 2022 be the year of total deliverance from all manners of insecurity challenges in the country.",

I wish speedy recovery to those injured,\u201d he added.\n\nThe office of the Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir said that a \u201chigh level inquiry\u201d has been ordered\u201d to look into the incident.\n\nDeadly stampedes are fairly common during Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with few safety or crowd control measures.\n\nIn October 2016, at least 24 people were killed and dozens injured in a stampede at a Hindu religious ceremony on the outskirts of Varanasi, a city in Uttar Pradesh state known for its temples.\n\nIn October 2013, a stampede in Madhya Pradesh state in central India killed more than 110 people, mostly women and children.\n\nTwo stampedes in as many months in India in 2008 left more than 370 Hindus dead. Others in Kerala in 2011 and in Madhya Pradesh two years later each killed more than 100.",

President Macron said the next few weeks would be difficult, but he was \u201coptimistic for the year to come\u201d\n\nIsrael has become one of the first countries in the world to approve a fourth Covid vaccination.\n\nIn his comments, Dr Tedros also alluded to low vaccination rates.\n\nWhile most of the population in Europe and the Americas have received at least one dose, a WHO target of full vaccination rates in 40% of every country by the end of 2021 has been missed across most of Africa.\n\nDr Tedros has previously criticised wealthier nations for \u201cgobbling up\u201d the global vaccine supply, fully vaccinating much of their populations while others wait for their first doses.\n\nThe WHO has set a new goal for 2022: vaccinate 70% of people in all countries by July to end the pandemic.",
