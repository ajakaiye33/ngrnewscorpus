The state government led by Governor Hope Uzodimma acknowledges this fact as well. This can be seen by the novel approach the Government is adopting to holistically tackle the challenge.\u201d\n\nGACIY said in August 2019, media reports indicated that thousands of people were displaced and houses submerged in floodwater in communities in Oguta LGA, Ohaji/Egbema LGA and Owerri.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cThe National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) put the figure of the displaced people in Orsu Obodo alone at 2,000, and that 70 houses were submerged by the flood.\n\n\u201cThe impressive flood control works going on in Owerri, especially the novel Balloon Technology with four collection centres at Dick-Tiger, MCC/Chukwuma Nwaoha, Trans-Egbu and Mbaise Road Park, is commendable.\n\n\u201cThe recent flooding witnessed in some parts of Owerri was therefore as a result of ongoing construction works, which the Government is addressing urgently. Government has also commenced another round of de-silting the drainage and would soon address the menace of flooding in Akwakuma and other areas.\n\n\u201cImo people, we need not see the challenge of flooding as a political problem. It is a natural disaster that spares no nation, state or political party. Flooding is no respecter of developed nations, it is no respecter of underdeveloped nations either.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of flooding will not go away with a wave of the hand. Government will do a lot to address it. Understanding this will not only help us plan better, it will as well equip us to respond better in such times.\n\n\u201cWe can be patient with the Government, because construction work takes time. As it is, the Government is adequately addressing the problem. With the paucity of funds, the government is juggling a lot of competing responsibilities to address the challenge, because flooding could be life threatening. That is why the Government has prioritized it.\n\n\u201cWe are Imo people and we love our state. We should not allow bitter politicians to drive us crazy with false claims and false alarms. Government is working. And the flooding we see today in some parts of Owerri, we shall see them no more.\u201d",

          "text": "NEC to decide embattled chairman\u2019s fate\n\nMark panel may meet Secondus, NWC\n\nThe crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may have worsened following a disagreement between the two main gladiators \u2013 Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and the suspended National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus \u2013 over a peace term proposed by the governor.\n\nThe governor, in the peace plan he gave the eight-man reconciliation panel headed by Chief David Mark, insists that Secondus must quit as national chairman; his tenure expires on October 31; he can no longer attend meetings of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC), National Executive Council (NEC) Board of Trustees (BoT) and National Caucus henceforth; and should withdraw his case at the Kebbi State High Court which had restored him to his position as PDP chairman.\n\nBut the embattled chairman and his backers regard the conditions as \u201cawkward, one-sided and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nSecondus is said to believe strongly that his mandate remains sacrosanct and that his suspension by court from his ward in Rivers State is illegal.\n\nHe is also of the firm conviction that no individual is empowered by the PDP Constitution to remove a party officer and that Wike cannot excise him (Secondus) from NEC, NWC other statutory meetings of organs of the party.\n\nWhile he is willing to withdraw court case, Wike must show concrete commitment to peace by withdrawing the court case against him (Secondus) too.\n\nWith both sides unwilling to compromise, party sources hinted last night that it was becoming obvious that the only option left for the aggrieved parties to settle the crisis is litigation.\n\nElders of the party are however said to be worried that leaving the crisis for the courts to resolve could cost PDP the 2023 elections.\n\nConsequently, the Mark committee may meet with Secondus and members of the National Working Committee (NWC) tomorrow or Tuesday.\n\nThe panel is expected to submit its report on or before the meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NEC is expected to take a final decision on the crisis in the party.\n\nThe Nation gathered that Wike gave his terms when he met with David Mark\u2019s committee in Port Harcourt.\n\nAccording to a source, the governor restated his commitment to peace and stability in the party but declared that Secondus should not be allowed to be part of the meetings of the NWC, NEC, Board of Trustees and National Caucus meetings.\n\nHe insisted on October 31 as the date for the National Convention.\n\nHe said if the conditions were met, PDP\u2019s problems and cases would be over.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe governor listed his terms which he felt will help resolve the PDP crisis and pave the way for a smooth, free and fair national convention.\n\n\u201cAfter listening to his terms, members of the panel promised to get back to the governor.\n\n\u201cBut his options were untenable to Secondus and his backers because they amount to technical removal of the PDP chairman.\n\n\u201cThey alleged that Wike has not conceded anything other than lip service commitment to end legal disputes.\u201d\n\nA source in Secondus\u2019 camp dismissed Wilke\u2019s terms as unacceptable.\n\nThe source said: \u201cHe is desperate to ensure that Secondus does not complete his term in office. And we know he has no genuine case in court. The so-called restraining order is unfortunate; it cannot stand.\n\n\u201cOn our part, Secondus is willing to withdraw his case in court but without conditions. Wike has not shown any commitment to peace.\n\n\u201cA few days after Mark panel\u2019s members left him, Secondus was suspended at the Ward level in a kangaroo manner when the PDP constitution is clear on the procedures to follow.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the intervention of the Chief Justice of Nigeria has made Wike\u2019s camp to be jittery. No court will issue an ex parte order again or recklessly.\n\n\u201cWere it not for his respect for the party and elders, Secondus would have preferred to go the whole hog of the legal process. There is no way the suspension can stand. But in politics, one must learn to concede.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that party leaders are worried over the consequences of lingering court cases on the chances of the party in 2023.\n\n\u201cYou can see how leaders like ex-Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso are already raising the red flag on how the party is sliding into brinkmanship.\n\n\u201cAll our leaders believe that judicial process cannot solve the problem at hand. This was why the Mark committee was set up,\u201d a BOT member said.\n\nIt was similarly gathered that Mark panel members will meet with NWC members between Monday and Tuesday.\n\nA source close to the panel said: \u201cNWC members have been put on notice that Mark and his team will have audience with them and Secondus.\n\n\u201cThe committee is actually expected to submit its report for NEC consideration. So, as critical stakeholders, the panel opted to seek their inputs too.\n\n\u201cNEC is going to meet on Thursday in Abuja to take a definite position on the crisis in the party.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Kano State, Dr. Rabiu Kwankwaso, on Friday warned the warring parties in the PDP that their conduct is capable of tearing the party apart.\n\nThe PDP chieftain said in a BBC Hausa interview that the party does not need any crisis at this time it is losing members.\n\n\u201cNow the strength of the party has reduced and in the end what will happen is that it will tear us apart,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou see, the result will not help us since we do not have a president and we do not have many governors.\u201d\n\nHe urged party members to wait and let the chairman end his tenure as he has only one month left. Kwankwaso also advised party leaders to focus on their people and see ways they can help them.\n\nSecondus on Wednesday expressed willingness for an out-of-court resolution of the crisis that led to his suspension from office.\n\nThe embattled chairman told the Mark Committee that he was forced to approach the Kebbi High Court for a counter-injunction in response to the one initiated in Rivers State.\n\nSecondus is said to have backed up his claim with Article 59 (3) of the party\u2019s constitution which stipulates that no executive committee, whether at ward, local government, state or zonal level, can remove or sanction any member of the party\u2019s National Executive Council.",

He reportedly returned to Nigeria last year after his PhD programme.\n\nHis abduction has thrown the Wawa community into confusion, bringing all activities to a halt.\n\nAlhaji Aliyu is the fifth district head to be abducted in the state by gunmen in the last six months.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Guber poll: Zoning tears Southeast apart",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Geoffrey Anyanwu (Enugu), Okey Sampson (Umuahia), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri) and Obinna Odogwu (Awka)\n\nDifferent political blocs and cultural zones in the Southeast states are already positioning for the plum governorship seat of the respective states in the build up to the 2023 general elections.\n\nOne factor that has been recurrent in the permutations is the issue of charter of equity. Sunday Sun investigation showed that there is no written agreement in the states except in Abia, spelling out power sharing arrangement. At best, what is referred to as charter of equity is \u201ca mere gentleman agreement that turned into some form of convention\u201d overtime in those states.\n\nFor that reason, when it favours a section, they bandy the so-called equity charter and in another breathe, the same people will turn around to say that the purported charter is meaningless.\n\nSo, ahead of the 2023 election, tension is rising particularly in Enugu and Abia states where groups are divided on the issue of charter of equity.\n\nAnambra\n\nBut before then, the Anambra governorship slated for November 6 is around the corner and the question is what role will the charter of equity place in who succeeds Governor Willie Obiano?\n\nSunday Sun gathered that there was no official agreement among stakeholders in the state for a zoning arrangement. In fact, the issue of zoning was never on the table until former Governor Peter Obi began to shop for his successor in 2013/2014.\n\nObi was said to have opted to get his successor from Anambra North Senatorial District so that people from that area could have a taste of the Agu Awka Government House.\n\nOther reasons given by those within the corridors of power in Anambra while Obi reigned said that because of the limited development projects in the northern part of the state, a governor from that area would make it a duty to develop there and make it more economically viable.\n\nHowever, those who seemed to have a better knowledge of the politics behind that move said that there was more to it than met the eye.\n\nRegardless of whatever the reason was, Obi succeeded in installing Obiano as his successor with the help of other eminent persons, including the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Senator Victor Umeh and wife of the late leader of the party, Mrs Bianca Ojukwu.\n\nToday, the Obiano-led APGA government, not only made it clear that power would shift to Anambra South Senatorial District, but had gone ahead to elect its governorship candidate, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo from the zone as its candidate.\n\nBut APGA\u2019s argument has been faulted by many political commentators in the state who made it clear that Anambra has no certified zoning arrangement whatsoever. In addition, candidates of major political parties had always emerged from the three zones in the state .\n\nThey equally argued that even if there was a charter, the governorship seat has rotated amongst the three Senatorial Districts of the state, and a fresh round could start from any of the zones.\n\nAnambra South has produced four governors of the state in the persons of Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju and Dame Virgy Etiaba. Senator Andy Uba\u2019s stint was punctured by the court that threw him out of office.\n\nFor Anambra Central, there are Senator Chris Ngige and Peter Obi, while the incumbent governor, Obiano, represents Anambra North.\n\nInterestingly, most of the political parties that have fielded candidates for the November 6 election in the state, elected their candidates from Anambra South. What is not clear at the moment, is if the electorate in the state would vote based on zones or quality of candidates. The latter may be the case.\n\nEnugu\n\nIn Enugu state, there is fierce disagreement on how zoning arrangement started with a group claiming that it started with the present democratic experience that commenced in 1999 and the other saying it was from the Second Republic.\n\nThe two groups also hold different opinions as to its smooth running in the state. While the post-1999 group feels it has been faithfully observed, the other holds that there was a hijack of the process that needed to be corrected if zoning must continue in the state.\n\nOf interest is that these views were not just held by a particular zone, in other words, there are people and groups from each of the three Senatorial Districts supporting either of the views.\n\nWhile the people of Enugu East zone are laying claim that 2023 is their turn and had the support of some groups from the two zones especially Enugu West zone, some groups are saying that now the governorship has rotated and gone round, the next round of rotation could start from any zone as there was no ballot cast to choose the first beneficiary zone.\n\nJust like in Anambra, people from major political parties had at every governorship election contested from zones not favoured by the ruling party. So, it is only the ruling party in Enugu that could have the power to zone the position.\n\nA proponent of zoning, Ernest Nweze, senior special assistant to the governor of the state, said that as one of the foundation members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu State, he was aware that the gubernatorial zoning in the state started \u201cin 1998 during the preparation for the transition we are in now.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cBy 1999, there was this hustling and bustling on the zone through which the governor will come from and by then a lot of guber aspirants were in the race. A meeting was held at the late Igwe Nnaji palace, at a time the settlement was to be done, it was agreed that any zone that first produced the governor will hand over to another zone at the expiration of their tenure and subsequently to the remaining zone.\n\n\u201cSo, it happened that the lot fell on Enugu East and Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani was chosen to run for the PDP. Constitutionally, you cannot ask anybody not to contest, but what we have said that this thing will be coming from this zone, you as a Nigerian can contest, but Enugu State people or the electorate have their eyes on the ball; which is the zone chosen. So, at the end of the day, other parties bought the same idea as it was good and all fielded their candidates from that zone.\n\n\u201cSo, Chimaroke won the election and at the end of his tenure it moved to Enugu West and Enugu West people chose Sullivan Chime and towards the end of his tenure the same scramble that is going on now started again and Sullivan said it is going to Enugu North. We are talking of post-1999, so he handed over to the Nsukka man who is the current governor (Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi). So, the first segment of the circle has been completed. Now, it goes back to Enugu East zone for us to maintain the clockwise. The zoning has been faithfully observed here in the state and as it is, the lot will fall on Enugu East to produce the next governor.\u201d\n\nBut countering him, Chekwas Okonkwo who feels it is the turn of Enugu West said: \u201cIn Enugu State politics, we see Chief Ifeanyichukwu Nwobodo, the former governor of old Anambra State as our political father in the state. In 1999, Nwobodo said it was the turn of Enugu West, because he and Chief C.C. Onoh from East had been governors, Dr. Okwy Nwodo from North had also been governor. Then he said it was the turn of Enugu West and former Minister of State for Health, the late Silas Iloh was penciled down for it. Then along the line something happened, they did a coup through the wife of Nwobodo and twisted the hand of Enugu West; taking their turn to Enugu East for Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani. And Enugu West walked out of Jim\u2019s house then.\n\n\u201cSo, because of this thing that happened then, I don\u2019t think there is anything like zoning in Enugu State. If there should be zoning, Enugu West is the zone that should produce the next governor because if you come to the equation of the three senatorial zones, Enugu East, Enugu North and Enugu West; Enugu West has only been governor once in the person of Sullivan Chime. Enugu East has gone thrice, Chief C.C. Onoh, Jim Nwobodo and Chimaroke Nnamani, and then Enugu North has two in the persons of Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo and the present governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. So, you can see that it is Enugu West that is being cheated, but what we are saying now is not zoning, it\u2019s how we can redeem Enugu State and make it work again.\u201d\n\nAlready, all manner of scheming is going on including rallies with Governor Ugwuanyi in attendance where endorsements are publicly made in support of power shift to Enugu East zone.\n\nBut the organizers of the Enugu West solidarity rally tagged: \u201cIfe-Emelumma Enugu West Unity Rally for Gburugburu\u201d, got more than they bargained as elder statesman, Senator Hyde Onuaguluchi mounted the podium and declared that there is no zoning arrangement for the governorship election in the state.\n\nHe challenged all the key stakeholders present at the rally held at Awgu Local Government Area Secretariat, on Saturday, August 7, 2021, to state the specific details of such an alleged zoning arrangement, that he, himself was not privy to.\n\nOnuaguluchi who likened what is happening to Ndigbo in Nigeria to exactly what greater Awgu people are passing through in Enugu State, however, urged the governor not to mind those talking of zoning the governorship as there had never been such an agreement.\n\nGoing memory lane, he said: \u201cIn 1990/1991, when I contested for governorship, there was no zoning. In 1999, when Chimaroke Nnamani from Enugu East, Victor Nduka Agu from Enugu West and Gbazueagu (Nweke Gbazueagu), also from Enugu West contested, there was no zoning. In 2003, Hon. Fidel Ayogu from Enugu North, Ugochukwu Agballah, Anayo Onwuegbu and Alex Obiechina, all from Enugu West contested against then incumbent, Chimaroke Nnamani, there was no zoning. In 2007, it was Okey Ezea from Enugu North versus Sullivan Chime and Ugochukwu Agballah from Enugu West. In 2011, it was Okey Ezea from Enugu North and then incumbent, Sullivan Chime from Enugu West. It has always been so.\n\n\u201cMy father was a major political player and he was not aware of such. Myself, I have been involved in Enugu governorship politics before any of you here.\u201d\n\nSunday Sun learnt that at a point, the organizers had to switch off the microphone, but Onuaguluchi held on to it, refusing to leave the stage without finishing his speech. He also vowed to lay a curse on whoever switched off the microphone.\n\nHowever, Governor Ugwuanyi intervened by asking that the political war horse be allowed to finish his \u201ctable-shaking\u201d speech.\n\nEbonyi\n\nDuring the last stage of the struggle for the creation of Ebonyi State, its founding fathers made spirited efforts to entrench a power rotation system that will ensure that no part of the state monopolised the governorship.\n\nFounding fathers of the state operating under the aegis of Ebonyi State Creation Movement led by Chief Martin Elechi on October 2, 1994 set up a committee known as Charter of Equity Committee to outline modalities for rotation of power in the then emerging state. The Committee chaired by Chief Okeagu Ogada submitted its report to the leaders of Ebonyi State Creation Movement on July 21, 1996, three months before the creation of the state.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that the report was never adopted by members of the state creation movement as the two major blocs in the state: Abakaliki and Afikpo; failed to reach agreement on the choice of the state capital and which zone should produce the first governor of the state.\n\nSpeaking recently in Abakaliki, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, recounted the incidents of that period, noting that he was among the Igbo leaders sent to intervene in the matter by the then Head of State, the late General Sani Abacha.\n\nIwuanyanwu disclosed that it was in his house in Owerri that the last meeting on the matter was held.\n\nAccording to Iwuanyanwu who was in Ebonyi for Governor David Umahi\u2019s 58th birthday celebrations, the Ebonyi State Creation Movement led by Chief Martin Elechi, the late Dr Offia Nwali, Chief Francis Orji and Dr Agom Eze finally agreed at the meeting in his house that Abakaliki should be the state capital while Afikpo zone should produce the first governor of the state.\n\n\u201cWe resolved that the headquarters should be in Abakaliki and that the first governor will come from the old Afikpo zone. That was the decision we took. Then we didn\u2019t know the dynamics of politics. When the political activities started, parties were formed; APP selected a candidate from the Afikpo zone while PDP selected a candidate from the Abakaliki zone and when the election was conducted the PDP man from Abakaliki, Dr Sam Egwu won,\u201d he said.\n\nIwuanyanwu\u2019s story correctly explained how PDP took over the governorship of Ebonyi and rotated power among the three Senatorial Districts of the state for 21 years, from 1999 to 2020.\n\nThe first governor of the state, Dr Sam Egwu (Ebonyi North) in 2007 handed over to Chief Martin Elechi (Ebonyi Central). Martin Elechi governed the state from 2007 to 2015 and handed over to Dave Umahi (Ebonyi South).\n\nHowever, in October 2020, Governor Umahi did the unthinkable when he defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC). He became the first governor in power in the state to leave PDP for another political party.\n\nFollowing Governor Umahi\u2019s defection to the APC, there has been fears and anxiety over the fate of zoning ahead of the 2023 governorship election.\n\nSome political actors argue that since the governorship has rotated amongst the three zones of the state that the next round of zoning could start from any zone of the state. But some others argue that the next round of zoning should go back to Ebonyi North where it started in 1999.\n\nBut the Ezza clan in Ebonyi Central are clamouring that 2023 is their turn to produce the governor of the state given that they are the oldest and largest in population in the state.\n\nReacting to the arguments recently during stakeholders\u2019 meeting with leaders of Ezza clan at the Christian Ecumenical Centre in Abakaliki, Governor Umahi said that the next governor of the state would come from the Abakaliki bloc, consisting of Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central.\n\nMeanwhile, natives of the state under the aegis of Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in Diaspora (AESID) have rejected the zoning agreement, saying that competence, capability, and credibility should be the standard for anyone to succeed Umahi. In a recent statement by its President, Paschal Oluchukwu, the group said that the campaign in the media by some interests to respect \u2018charter of equity\u2019 does not exist.\n\n\u201cThe calls in some quarters for the mediocre acts of zoning of political offices have once again been brought to bear in the debate over who succeeds Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi in 2023.\n\n\u201cThose who engineer this premise their position on what they term equity and fairness in their delusional fantasy to keep an \u2018equity bond\u2019 that neither exists nor has ever been manifest in Ebonyi politics,\u201d he stated.\n\nAbia\n\nThe situation in Abia State is not any different, though its founding fathers enshrined \u2018zoning\u2019 in the Article of Association known as \u201cAbia Charter of Equity\u201d, proceeding the creation of the state. The major plank of the Abia Charter of Equity was that the governorship seat must be rotated among the state\u2019s component parts.\n\nZoning could be said to be on course in Abia, even recent happenings indicated attempt to torpedo the whole sequence. It started in 1999, when Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Chief Whip of the Senate, who is from Abia North, became governor of the state.\n\nAfter Kalu\u2019s two terms in 2007, Senator Theodore Orji, from the Central Senatorial District assumed the mantle of leadership.\n\nIn line with the zoning arrangement, the governorship seat shifted to Abia South, where the current governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu hails from, when Orji finished in 2015.\n\nHowever, the opposition political parties in the state mainly the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) have at various fora said that they would have nothing to do with zoning presently until they grab power before they could thinker with any zoning idea. So, with this, zoning has majorly domiciled with the PDP that has been ruling the state since 1999.\n\nRegardless, within the PDP fold itself, the zoning arrangement appears threatened with recent developments which brewed crisis of interest in the Abia chapter of the party.\n\nA group, Ukwa La Ngwa Elders\u2019 Council made up mostly of PDP faithful from the Ngwa extraction, stirred the hornet\u2019s nest on June 23, when they met at Isialangwa-North Local Government Area, and came up with a communiqu\u00e9 which read in part: \u201cThat the people of Ukwa La Ngwa remain conscious of the indisputable fact and truth that Abia State is basically made up of two different geo-political zones, Old Aba Division and Old Bende Division.\n\n\u201cThat the good people of Ukwa La Ngwa, in pursuit of justice, equity and fairness, knowing that the people of old Bende have governed the state for an unbroken 16 years, 1999 to 2015, unequivocally demand and insist that they will also govern for 16 consecutive years, that is from 2015 to 2031.\n\n\u201cThat, by virtue of justice, equity and fairness, the people of Ukwa La Ngwa will collectively and ceaselessly work for the democratic enthronement of Abia State governor of Ukwa La Ngwa extraction, from any of the three Ukwa La Ngwa Local Government Areas of Isialangwa-North, Isialangwa-South and Osisioma, otherwise known as Umunne Ato Ngwa in Abia Central Senatorial District, in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat no Ukwa La Ngwa son, daughter or wife will dare accept the position of a governorship running mate in any political party for 2023 election.\u201d\n\nAmong those who signed the communiqu\u00e9 for the group are Dr. Max Nduaguibe, its leader and Chief Acho Nwakanma, (former deputy governor of the state), deputy leader.\n\nHowever, a day after the communiqu\u00e9 was issued, on June 24, another group from the same zone, the Joint Youth Council of Ukwa (JYCU), met and dissociated the Ukwa people from the communiqu\u00e9 issued by the Ukwa La Ngwa Elders\u2019 Council. They were of the view that inasmuch as they agree that the old Aba Division should retain the governorship in 2023, it must come from Ukwa area. The Ukwa youths group made her position known through a communiqu\u00e9 it issued, which read in part: \u201cThat we, the people of Ukwa East/Ukwa West, that is, Ndoki and Asa people, are unarguably, a distinct political bloc in Abia State, with a distinct histo-cultural pedigree.\n\n\u201cThat as a distinct political bloc, we, the people of Ndoki and Asa strongly believe that the governorship should be retained in old Aba Division; that is Ukwa La Ngwa in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat as a distinct political bloc, we firmly and irrevocably advocate that, like what happened in Old Bende where governorship was held for 16 consecutive years by core Bende and Umuahia group, it is the turn of Ukwa people to mount the governorship of the state come 2023.\u201d\n\nFrom the other divide, Abia North PDP reacted swiftly. A statement endorsed by Chief Abraham Amah, PDP zonal chairman, Abia North regretted the current threat to the office of the executive governor requiring him to hand over power to a section of the state by 2023.\n\nHe noted that Abia South did not secure the governorship slot in 2015 and 2019 on the basis of threats, but rather on wide consultation amongst critical stakeholders.\n\nAbraham made it clear that no section of the state can secure the governorship slot come 2023 on cheap threats and propaganda, adding that it was better to jaw-jaw than to war-war.\n\nThe polarization was going out of hand that the Abia State PDP State Working Committee met and in a statement directed \u201call our officers at all levels, but particularly at the state level, to desist from attending factional or sectional meetings aimed at the zoning of the 2023 governorship or any other position as the case may be in the state\u201d.\n\nAdvising members of the party to shun any act capable of hitting up the polity, the SWC further cautioned its officers against signing any decision, communiqu\u00e9 or press release issued at any of such meetings, warning that sanction awaits anyone that would flout the directive.\n\nAs leader of the party in the state, Governor Ikpeazu came out strongly to douse the rising tension. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka and entitled, \u201cDon\u2019t overheat the polity, I am still in charge\u201d, the governor expressed deep concern at the \u201ccurrent exchange of political brickbats by politicians and groups over who succeeds him in 2023, such exchanges are unnecessary, premature and capable of distracting my administration\u201d.\n\nIkpeazu told the political gladiators that he was still in charge of the state and would not in any way or by any means be stampeded out of office by people he described as those who want to alter the natural order of things.\n\nAlthough the governor appreciated the rights of persons and groups to canvass their political ideas and preferences, but he warned that timing was of essence and critical in the permutations, warning them that there could only be one governor at any particular time.\n\nHe, however, assured that when the time was right, his successor will emerge through a peaceful process of consensus and justice, involving all interest groups in the state, insisting that it is God that anoints leaders.\n\nImo\n\nAfter Chief Sam Mbakwe who hailed from the Okigwe zone became the first civilian governor in Imo State in 1979, the next civilian governor of the state was Chief Evans Enwerem from Owerri zone. By 1999, Chief Achike Udenwa from Orlu zone became governor and left office in 2007.\n\nZoning of the governorship became more pronounced as Udenwa\u2019s tenure was coming to an end, but by the stroke of fate, power shifted to Okigwe zone with the emergence of Ikedi Ohakim on the platform of Progressive People Alliance (PPA).\n\nBut Ohakim could not complete eight years like his predecessor, as he lost the 2011 election to Chief Rochas Okorocha from Orlu zone. He like Udenwa also had his two terms.\n\nThe second tenure denied Ohakim is believed to have altered the political arrangement in Imo. Expectation was that a governor of Okigwe zone origin where Ohakim hails from, would have balanced the equation in 2019. But that did not happen.\n\nThough Owerri zone was the beneficiary as Emeka Ihedioha succeeded Okorocha, but his victory song was cut short by the Supreme Court, which declared Hope Uzodimma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Orlu zone the real winner of the election.\n\nThe situation in Imo has no room for charter of equity given that Orlu zone has practically dominated the scene. This sets the stage for an epic battle in 2023 as Governor Uzodimma would naturally go for a second term; while the two others zones fight to have a bite of the political cake.\n\nFor State Chairman of the defunct All Peoples Party (APP) and ex-Commissioner for Information in the state, Chief Orikaeze Ajumbe, charter of equity could only be operational in the state when power reverts back to Okigwe zone to complete Ohakim\u2019s tenure that lasted for only one term.\n\n\u201cIt cannot work until Ohakim finishes his two terms, which Owerri zone supported to deny him. After that, power will go to Owerri zone. So, Okigwe zone should be supported to finish its remaining one term of four years and Ohakim is the only person assured by law to do only one term,\u201d Ajumbe said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.\n\nAs it stands, Orlu zone has held power almost consecutively for 17 years of eight years each of Udenwa and Okorocha and this present tenure of Uzodimma, thereby making nonsense of whatever charter of equity that may have existed in the state.",

Balarabe Salame told THISDAY that the faction followed the party\u2019s guidelines by obtaining the forms and electing its executives at wards and local governments\u2019 levels.\n\nHe further disclosed that \u201cthe other faction just stayed in somebody\u2019s room and write the names of their executives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m telling you, what they did in the other faction is undemocratic; you can\u2019t deny people of their right to express their franchise,\u201d he added.\n\nSalame and the Speaker of the state house of assembly, Hon. Muhammad Aminu Achida, belongs to one faction, while the former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, and the Minister of Police Affairs, Mr. Maigari Dingyadi belong to another faction led by Wamakko.\n\nAddressing the delegates and members of the party in Bodinga, the headquarters of Bodinga Local Government Area of the state, the police minister said the party in the state in its wisdom adopted consensus.\n\nThe APC congresses were marred by the crisis in Adamawa State as aggrieved party members from Yola North and Yola South LGAs faulted the distribution of election materials to members who were not supposed to handle the materials.\n\nChairman of the Congress Committee, Professor Umar Katsayal, and his committee members narrowly escaped an attack by irate youths when they were about to leave the party\u2019s secretariat.\n\nThe youths stormed the party\u2019s secretariat in their numbers demanding election materials for their zones.\n\nThe senator representing Adamawa Central, Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed Binani also stormed the party secretariat to kick against the process.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that journalists (cameramen) were forced to delete the visuals of the fracas at the party secretariat.\n\nIn Mubi North and other local governments in the state, some APC stakeholders organised their own separate local government congress in their preferred venues.\n\nThe crisis in the Ogun State chapter of the party deepened yesterday as the group loyal to Governor Dapo Abiodun and a faction of the party led by Senator Ibikunle Amosun held parallel congresses across the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s congresses, the two factions of the APC had sworn in the elected executives that emerged from the parallel ward congresses they held in July.\n\nOn the eve of yesterday\u2019s congresses, the seven-man congress committee led by Mr. Wale Ohu had cautioned the APC members in the state against holding parallel congresses.\n\nAddressing journalists after the conduct of the congresses, Ohu emphasised that any congress held outside the supervision of the committee was null and void.\n\nWhile a faction of the party in Ekiti State called Southwest Agenda for Tinubu 2023 presidential poll (SWAGA) had challenged the previous ward congresses, the Ekiti State APC yesterday insisted that the local government congresses were undertaken without violating the constitution of the party and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe Secretary of the Ekiti State APC Congress Committee, Mr. Job Femi Akindeke, said the unconfirmed report that SWAGA went to court to challenge the ward congress did not vitiate the outcome of the local government congresses.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that there wasn\u2019t any legal encumbrance to our local government congress. We followed the due process of the law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to our people to exhaust internal mechanisms before resorting to court. The process is still ongoing and the party has not received any court order stopping us from doing what the party is constitutionally empowered to do,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Rivers State chapter of the APC led by the Minister of Transportation also yesterday held what it described as peaceful local government congresses across the 23 LGAs of the state.\n\nThe congresses were boycotted by the supporters of a former Senator representing Rivers East, Senator Magnus Abe.\n\nHowever, the spokesman of the caretaker committee of the party in the state, Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, told THISDAY that the election was peaceful and smooth, adding that the party was now positioned to take over power in the state.\n\nBut a leader of Abe\u2019s faction, who spoke off record, said they boycotted the exercise because it did not follow due process. The faction had rejected the ward congresses of APC held in the state.\n\nThe faction had also submitted a petition to the national secretariat of the party on the development.\n\nIn Niger State, the consensus option adopted by the APC to choose its local government officials hit the rocks in some parts of the state following the insistence by aspirants for election to be held.\n\nThe consensus arrangement was challenged in Chanchaga, Paikoro, Bida Lapai Agaie, among other LGAs.\n\nDespite the emergence of two factions of the party in Enugu State, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama has hailed what he described as the peaceful conduct of the local government congresses in the state.\n\nOnyeama disclosed this in the Udi Local Government Area of the state while briefing journalists on the outcome of the exercise in his council.\n\nThe minister described the process as democracy-in-action, adding that the people were allowed to willingly choose their leaders.\n\nHowever, supporters of the Director-General of the Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr. Osita Okechukwu, did not participate in the exercise held by Onyeama\u2019s faction.\n\nMeanwhile, former Senate President, Dr. Ken Nnamani, has described as fake, a letter purportedly issued by the national leadership of the party, recognising Mr. Ben Nwoye as the state party chairman.\n\nNnamani spoke during the congress in Nkanu West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHe said that the letter which was circulating in the social media and purportedly issued by the Secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe was forged.\n\nIn Imo State, the congresses were conducted by supporters of Governor Hope Uzodimma without the participation of Senator Rochas Okorocha and Senator Ifeanyi Araraume\u2019s camps.\n\nImo State Chairman of the APC loyal to Governor Uzodimma, Chief Marcillinus Nlemigbo, said the exercise was free and fair.\n\nThe two APC factions in Lagos State also held parallel local government congresses across the 245 wards of the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe two congresses were held without any violence as the factions comprising the Tunde Balogun-led group and the Lagos4Lagos group held their separate local government congresses in different venues.\n\nOn the side of the Balogun-led faction, a former member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Ipoola Omisore said the Lagos chapter is returning the party to the people at the grassroots.\n\nIn Agege Local Government Area, the Vice-Chairman, Apex Committee, Lagos4Lagos, Hon. Prince Sunday Ajayi said his group remains the only faction of the Lagos APC that upholds the party\u2019s constitution in the conduct of the congresses.\n\n\u201cWe are two factions in Lagos but Lagos4Lagos is the only faction of the APC that conducted the ward congress. The other side only paraded appointed candidates but we own the population of the party.\n\n\u201cFor instance, they held local government election; Lagos APC registered 2.5 million members but less than 500,000 members voted as a result of our boycotting the election. We have over 2 million members in Lagos state and that is why the national body cannot close its eyes to us,\u201d he added.\n\nTwo factions of the party in Osun State led by Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, also battled each other in the state.\n\nThe exercise was marred by the crisis in Ede North LGA as armed political hoodlums reportedly attacked members of the party who were holding their congress in the area.\n\nThe thugs, according to eyewitnesses, stormed Film House, NITEL area, beside Pere Police Station, Ede, with guns, cutlasses, and other weapons with which they attacked members of the APC.\n\nA former Chairman of Ede North Local Council Development Area, Mukaila Uthman, confirmed the attack, saying that he was a witness.\n\nOfficers of the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Services (DSS), and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) witnessed the congress which was held at Oduduwa College Ile-Ife in Ife Central LGA.\n\nThe majority of the APC members that participated in the exercise were members of The Osun Progressives (TOP), loyal to Aregbesola\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, however, stated that the crisis rocking the state chapter of APC is an internal affair that will soon be settled amicably.\n\nIn Kwara State, the APC faction, which is loyal to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq adopted consensus for its local government congresses of the party.\n\nThe faction loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed was not part of the arrangement.\n\nIn Bayelsa State, a faction of the party held congresses despite a court order that restrained the party from holding congresses in the state.\n\nWhile the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, was reportedly absent due to official commitment out the country, the Vice Chairman, South-south Zone of the APC Caretaker/Extra ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Chief David Lyon, was seen at party secretariat in Yenagoa at the end of the exercise.\n\nHowever, Sunday Frank-Oputu, a chieftain of the APC and member of the faction led by Hon. Ebierien Fala, faulted the conduct of the congress, describing it as a violation of a subsisting court order before the State High Court and Court of Appeal, sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nFrank-Oputu called on the party leadership to sanction Sylva and the caretaker State Secretary of the party, Alabo Martins over conduct of the congresses against subsisting court order.\n\nIn Abia State, two factions loyal to the state Chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa, and Chief Ikechi Emenike, held parallel congresses but the Local Government Congress Committee led by Hon. Israel Goli only supervised the congress conducted by the faction loyal to Emenike.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Ask banks not to implement payment directives\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has cautioned the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the federal government against going ahead with the planned payment of the sum of $418 million to some individuals and organisations for the roles they played in the Paris Club refund received by the federal government.\n\nThe governors have also warned all chief executives/managing directors and chief compliance officers of Nigeria\u2019s commercial banks against implementing the directives to pay the said sum to the affected parties.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was said to have approved the payment of the controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors, without considering the governors\u2019 calls for a forensic audit into the claims of the creditors.\n\nFollowing Buhari\u2019s approval, the Federal Ministry of Finance was also said to have directed the Debt Management Office (DMO) to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors, as approved by the president.\n\nBut the NGF, in the warning letter to the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN); Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; and the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms. Patience Oniha, questioned the rationale behind the payment of the alleged debt to the said consultants and contractors.\n\nThe governors argued that the said payment is already an issue of litigation.\n\nThe governors in the \u201cCaveat\u201d letter dated Friday, September 3, 2021, also wondered why the federal government was in a rush to make such payment to individuals at a time when both the federal and state governments need funds for provisions of critical infrastructure for the people.\n\nThe letter signed on behalf of the NGF by its lawyer, Mr. PH Ogbole (SAN), also warned all chief executives/managing directors and chief compliance officers of Nigeria commercial banks against giving effect to any directive regarding the payment of the said sum to the affected parties.\n\nOgbole, in the letter titled, \u201cCaveat on the Payment of $418 million Suspicious Debts\u201d, argued that since the federal government was aware of the current court cases challenging the payment of the alleged debts, it ought not to take any further steps on the matter.\n\nAccording to the senior lawyer, the governors on August 3, 2021, got wind of the federal government\u2019s move to effect the payment.\n\nHe noted that the governors learnt that some consultants/contractors alleged that they were retained by some states and had done some work for the states and local governments in Nigeria about the Paris Club refund.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance is said to have directed the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO) to issue Promissory Notes in favour of the Consultants. The purported amounts claimed by the various consultants are as follows: Ned Nwoko \u2013 $142,028,941; Ted Iseghoghi Edwards -$159 million; Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 $142,028,941.95 and Panic Alert System Limited and George Uboh \u2013 $47,831,920\u201d, Ogbole explained.\n\nHe explained that the consultants relied on judgments of the Federal High Court which are presently being challenged by the 36 governors in several actions in various courts.\n\nHe identified the cases to include suits number FHC/ Abj/CS/123/2018 between Panic Alert Security Systems Limited & Anor Vs Trustees of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum & 3 Others; FHC/ABJ/CS/453/2021 between\n\nTrustees of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum Vs Panic Alert Security Systems Limited & Anor (5 others); and M/3542/2021 between Riok Nigeria Limited Vs The Trustees of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum\n\nThe senior lawyer added that some of the consultants have already joined issues with the NGF, while the matters have been set down for hearing on September 28 and 29, 2021.\n\nHe further claimed that the Minister of Finance, the DG of DMO, and the AGF had since been duly served and notified of the pendency of these actions in court in different letters written by counsel to the NGF.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore strange and indeed alarming that having been served and made aware of the pendency of the various court cases, the Minister of Finance would readily but in complete disregard of the law direct that Promissory Notes be issued in favour of the consultants\u201d, he said.\n\nWhile arguing that custodians and managers of public funds are public trustees and must at all times act in the public interest, he stressed that the interest of all the states and local governments of the federation is involved in this instant case and ought to be protected by the Minister of Finance.\n\nOgbole added that \u201cthe issuance of Promissory Notes of a humongous sum of over $418 million to private persons for alleged consultancy work demands not only caution but strict due diligence, particularly when the judgments which gave rise to the payments sought to be enforced are the subject of pending litigation.\n\n\u201cMatters that are subjudice must not be acted upon in a manner that will foist a situation of complete helplessness on the courts and render their decisions nugatory,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, however, explained that this caveat was issued as a Further Notice to the Minister of Finance and the DG, DMO, to act in the interest of the public and refrain from foisting on the nation another case of P& lD in which, he noted, would have fleeced the nation of billions of dollars but for due diligence.\n\n\u201cThe nation is already going through economic adversity and every dollar is needed to be channelled to people-oriented projects. Public duty and probity demand that public trustees must, at all times, act in the interest of the people they serve to protect their commonwealth.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, justice must be allowed to run its full course.\n\n\u201cAll chief executives of banks and their compliance officers are hereby advised to desist from or otherwise not to accept for exchange or process for payment or giving value to any promissory notes issued by the DMO for purpose of satisfying alleged Paris Club Consultants fees afore-mentioned.\n\n\u201cThe entire public is also notified to be at the high alert of this hasty attempt to circumvent the rule of law and dissipate hard-earned public funds meant for development purposes to private persons on matters which are presently being litigated upon.\n\n\u201cLet no grant be sealed in the funds of the 36 states of the federation and the 774 local government areas in the sums mentioned in this caveat without notice to the caveator (the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum) as the matter of the payments is sub judice,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nKaduna state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, lost his polling unit to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday\u2019s Local government elections .\n\nAnnouncing the results for the El-Rufai\u2019s Angwan Sarki 001 polling unit, the Presiding Officer, Mohammed Sani said, in the Chairmanship election, the PDP scored 86 votes while the APC got 62 votes.\n\nSani said in the councillorship election, the PDP scored 100 votes while the APC recorded 53 votes.\n\nThe governor had earlier in an interview after casting his vote, expressed disappointment about the low turnout of voters in the council polls.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me is that I noticed that people didn\u2019t turn out much,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said there were challenges in some polling units as wrong machines were given.\n\n\u201cI know that in many polling units, there were challenges with the Electronic Voting Machines.\n\n\u201cSome machines were taken to the wrong polling units, so they had to be changed. So people who came out early to vote, thought that the voting had not started,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the use of Electronic Voting Machines for the elections, El-Rufai said \u201ctechnology is the key to minimising cheating in elections and unless we remove cheating in elections, we will never have credible leaders, we will never have accountable leaders and this is why we are committed to this.\u201d\n\nHe said there has been a significant improvement on the machines compared to the ones used in the 2018 LG polls.\n\nEl-Rufai said, the improved voting machine being used for the elections makes it nearly impossible to do multiple voting which, according to him, \u201chappened a lot in 2018.\u201d\n\nHe said the voting machine was activated with voting card, explaining that, \u201conce you come and you are accredited that this is your polling unit, you go to the voting machine, you place your voter\u2019s card, it opens the machine for you, you vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe whole process takes less than 15 seconds. So it is very quick, very efficient and you see your ballot paper being printed so that the ballot papers can be counted\u2026\n\n\u201cSo we are very happy with the improvement and we are pleased that this time it will be extremely difficult for anyone to rig these elections.\n\nHe explained further that, \u201cthe machines also transmit the results at the end of voting to a server as well as a back up at a USB as well as print copies for all parties and all the security agencies, so it is very difficult to alter anything.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration was committed to free and fair elections in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cAs I said several times, we are not going to behave like other parties or other state governments where the ruling parties win everything. \u201cWe will allow the people of Kaduna state to elect who they want, we do not have to win everywhere.\n\n\u201cWe know that we have work for the people of Kaduna state, we know that they can see the food print of the government and local government everywhere, the APC government and we are confident that all reasonable minded and fair minded people will vote for our party and our candidates because they know that we are committed the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in cheating, we don\u2019t believe in rigging elections, but we also do not believe that others should cheat us.\n\n\u201cThis is why we encourage SIECOM to come up with a very improved, full proof system and I am happy that they have done that.\n\n\u201cWhat we have shown in Kaduna is that it is possible to do this across Nigeria and I think INEC is looking at the experiment in Kaduna very closely.\n\n\u201cThey were observers in 2018 and they had sent a team to look at what we are doing in 2021.\n\nOur correspondence who visited some polling units in Kaduna South and Kaduna North LGAs, noted the general apathy among residents.\n\nIn Gidan Hakimi, Kakuri polling unit, Kaduna South LGA, both the agents of the APC and the PDP, confirmed that people did not come out to vote.\n\n\u201cI think that people didn\u2019t come out to vote because of the general hardship in the country\u201d, one of the party agents said.\n\nAlso at the Abubakar Kigo LEA Primary School polling unit, Kaduna North LGA, election officials were idle as people did not turn out.\n\nMeanwhile the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has raised the alarm over the conduct of the elections, alleging that the voting machines were programmed to accept and prints votes for the APC only.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the NUJ Press Centre on Saturday in Kaduna, spokesman of the state chapter of the party, Abraham Catoh, alleged that machines in some polling units were only printing results for the APC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Mohamed Buba Marwa has emphasised the need for pre-marital drug tests as a key factor to a stable home.\n\nMarwa made this suggestion at a conference organised by a non-government organisation (NGO) Coal to Diamond Support Network for young adults in Abuja at the weekend.\n\nMarwa\u2019s wife, who is the chief host of the conference, Mrs Munirat Marwa also emphasised the need for drug test before marriage, warning that drugs are destroying many marriages, families and communities.\n\nAt the conference, Marwa said substance use \u201chas been known not only to destroy marriages but equally lead to health problems, morbidity, injuries, violence, and death. Most often, the physical, psychological and social consequences of drug use are very obvious and disturbing.\u201d\n\nMarwa who was represented at the conference by a Principal Staff Officer on Drug Demand Reduction in NDLEA, Shehu Dankolo, said the mental, physical and spiritual quality of life of individuals has definite impact on a society\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nHe said if would-be couples choose to undergo HIV and genotype tests before marriage without any law compelling them, they should equally consider drug test as critical to their wellbeing and stability of their home.\n\nIn her remarks, Marwa urged youths preparing for wedding to take drug test as part of their preparations, adding that there is a difference between wedding and marriage.\n\nShe explained: \u201cThe wedding as we all know it is a short time event while marriage is intended for a lifetime. As such, the conference has come at the right time when couples are putting more importance and emphasis on the wedding festivities rather than the marriage itself.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important we pay attention to preparing for the marriage and one of such ways is through pre-marital counselling and drug test. This prepares the couples very well and has the ability to reduce domestic violence, divorce as well as increase happiness and longevity in marriages.\u201d\n\nOther notable speakers at the conference include wife of former Vice President Namadi Sambo, Hajiya Amina Namadi Sambo, President of the Group, Bilkisu Mohammed and the keynote speaker, Alhaji Sa\u2019id Takuma who all emphasised the need for proper counselling for would be couples to safeguard their marriages and future.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Bruce Fein, the US-based lawyer to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has said it is absurd that Nigeria still uses the 1999 constitution although it was imposed on the people by a military dictator.\n\nFein spoke in an exclusive interview with Human rights activist and Amnesty International designated Prisoner of Conscience, Omoyele Sowore, shortly after he and Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, were denied access to the IPOB leader by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nBruce Fein\n\nKanu had remained in detention since he was re-arrested by Nigerian authorities in collaboration with others outside the country.\n\nThe court had earlier ordered that his lawyers should be granted a routine visit to interact with the separatist leader while in detention.\n\nBut on Thursday, the DSS had denied the pair access despite meeting formal notification and existing procedures on visitation.\n\nSpeaking during the interview, Fein condemned the disregard for human rights and due process in Nigeria by government institutions.\n\nThe constitutional lawyer said globally, the right to self-determination and due process are fundamental rights of every citizen which should also be upheld by the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cEverybody recognises the right to self-determination and due process. Universally, the law condemns torture and extra-judicial killings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am an expert in constitutional law and it seems very odd to me from the US that Nigeria lives on a constitution ordained by a military dictator in 1999 with no input from the public. No referendum, nothing and the country is living under such a constitution 22 years later.\n\n\u201cTo me, that is totally absurd. We should look at how laws benefit the people, not just being manipulated to benefit those in power.\u201d\n\nWATCH: @MaziNnamdiKanu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s American Lawyer, Bruce Fein, Rubbishes Nigeria's 1999 Constitution In Interview With @YeleSowore, Says It's Absurd To Rely On Constitution Imposed By Military pic.twitter.com/TufaqaA7D1 \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) September 3, 2021\n\nThe court-ordered routine visit of the lawyers representing the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra took another dimension as the operatives of the DSS prevented them from seeing him on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, the DSS said, \"that the person assigned to receive us during yesterday's visit was on a special assignment.\u201d\n\nEjiofor stated that he was in the secret police\u2019s office with a constitutional lawyer from the United States (US), Bruce Fein, but they were prevented from seeing the separatist leader despite meeting formal notification and existing procedures on visitation.\n\nFein had in May filed a lawsuit on behalf of IPOB in the US to revoke the six A-29 Tucano fighter jets sold to the Nigerian government and also block the remaining six from being conveyed to the country.\n\nBoth Ejiofor and Fein were not allowed to see Kanu on Thursday.\n\nEjiofor, in the statement, described the action as \u201cridiculous and a clear violation of the court order on the guideline for visiting our client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cYesterday's court-ordered visit to our client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was aborted by the officials of the State Security Services (also known as the Department of State Services, DSS) for a reason we find extremely ridiculous.\n\n\u201cFollowing the arrival of Mr. Bruce Fein, a foremost American trained Constitutional Lawyer and IPOB's Attorney in the United States of America, the game took an interesting twist.\n\n\u201cDespite our formal notification to the Service, in line with the existing protocol, and in compliance with the Court-Ordered guideline, the officials of the Department of State Services came up with an excuse, 'that the person assigned to receive us during yesterday's visit was on a special assignment, and as such, the visit cannot be conducted.\n\n\u201cThis is not only ridiculous but a clear violation of the Court Order on guidelines for visiting our client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cFor the records, we have been consistently visiting our client on the specified days and time of the week, and there hasn't been any time we were denied access to him on the ground that an individual assigned to receive us was not available.\n\n\u201cNeedless to mention, that no one individual has been specifically assigned to receive us on any of the visits. They are fully aware that the visit takes place every Monday and Thursday.\n\n\u201cThankfully, we have another date for Monday, and we do hope that this individual will be available on Monday to receive us, whilst we have taken steps to formally bring this latest infraction to the attention of the Court.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to update you all, while we continue to urge for your relentless prayers and understanding. We are winning, you can be assured.\n\n\u201cThank you all and remain blessed.\u201d",

          "text": "Femi Falana, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to allow state governments to handle open grazing matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a way to curb farmer-herder clashes, some states have banned open grazing. In a similar effort, the federal government had disbursed N24 billion to four states, including Katsina for cattle ranching.\n\nBut in August, the president approved the review of 368 grazing reserves across 25 states in the country.\n\nThis is despite the federal government\u2019s National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) which provides for ranching of livestock to address the farmer-herder crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile speaking on Saturday at the inaugural ceremony of the Old Seminarian Association of Nigeria (OSAN) in Abuja, Falana asked why the president would approve money for ranching in Katsina, and then look for grazing routes in other states.\n\n\u201cTake the question of animal husbandry, where herders\u2014 armed herders are killing people. This is a problem that can be solved scientifically. Today, the governors of Kaduna, Zamfara and Katsina states have banned the interstate movement of cattle. Which is a ban on open grazing. The Kano state government is investing massively in RUGA settlement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn July, President Buhari gave N6.2 billion to Katsina state government for ranching. So if you are giving money for ranching to Katsina state, why are you now looking for grazing routes in other states?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn any case, the federal government never had a grazing reserve or grazing route. They were owned by the government of the old northern region. And we are talking of the 19 northern states now. So, what the federal government never had cannot be reclaimed.\n\n\u201cThis problem should be left to the states because aside from the federal capital territory, the land in every state is vested in the state governor on behalf of the people. So, the federal government should not continue to cause problems for our people.\n\n\u201cThis is a country of wonderful opportunity. We have always been united in our diversity. Right now, our country is sharply divided. Christians against Muslims, one ethnic group against another, and these are all diversionary tactics by the ruling class to keep our people divided.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer added that the problem of Nigeria is the same, as poverty is prevalent everywhere.",

          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Sept 1 deadline on anti-open grazing law: Bureaucracy or lack of political will?",
          "text": "In what seems an interplay of bureaucracy and lack of political will, many Southern Governors failed the September 1 deadline they had collectively set for themselves to promulgate anti-open grazing laws in their individual states.\n\nThe 17 Governors in the region had set the deadline during their July 5 meeting in Lagos State, which was a follow up to the announcement of a total ban on open-grazing during an earlier meeting on May 12 in Asaba, Delta State capital.\n\nThe decision was considered necessary after unsuccessful individual attempts to address the menace of open grazing in Southern states and the insecurity it breeds.\n\nThe Forum also recommended that the Federal Government should support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nIn a resolution after the meeting, the forum explained rationale for the ban on open grazing, stressing that, \u201cdevelopment and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South. Given this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South, including cattle movement to the South by foot.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Anti-open grazing: Lagos, Ogun, Edo, Anambra, Osun delaying law\n\nHowever, investigation by BusinessDay Sunday revealed that currently while a number of states have completely signed the bill into law, a few governors have sent the bill to the Houses of Assembly, whereas some have demonstrated a total lack of political will to pursue the project.\n\nAbout eight states- Ekiti, Ondo, Abia, Oyo, Delta, Enugu, Bayelsa, and Rivers- have enacted laws banning open grazing.\n\nWhereas in Osun and Ogun states, the Houses of Assembly have passed relevant laws awaiting governors\u2019 assent, in Akwa Ibom and Delta, the law is still in the works in parliament.\n\nThere is nothing on ground to indicate that anti-open grazing law is underway in Cross River, Ebonyi, Imo and Anambra states.\n\nThe Anambra State government had consistently said it had no plan to enact anti-open grazing law in the state because of \u201cthe cordial relationship with herders\u201d in the state.\n\nIn Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, is yet to send a bill to the Assembly for consideration despite being aware of the deadline. In the last few weeks, the Governor has received criticism among political leaders and stakeholders across the state, some of whom had publicly protested the delay in sending an anti-grazing bill to the state House of Assembly amid the worsening spate of insecurity in Edo.\n\nSimilarly, Imo State is said to have opted out of the resolution of the governors of the region.\n\nRead Also: Anti-open grazing law: Afenifere warns FG against frustrating enforcement\n\nHope Uzodimma, the state governor, was recently reported to have said, after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, that the state has opted for a partnership between farmers and herders. Uzodimma was reported to have said that there was no law forbidding open grazing by cattle rearers in Imo State.\n\nExplaining the position of the bill in Lagos and why the state missed the deadline, Gbenga Omotosho, commissioner for Information and Strategy, told BusinessDay, that the executive had sent the anti-grazing bill to the state House of Assembly and was awaiting its passage.\n\nOmotosho, however, dispelled assumption that the state was no longer committed to the passage of the anti-grazing law in view of the delay.\n\n\u201cThe Executive has sent the bill to the Assembly as soon as they send it back, the Governor would sign it into law. If people are speculating, we don\u2019t buy into that; the Assembly is yet to send it back, the Assembly has to do its own part,\u201d Omotosho said.\n\nIn Ogun State, Governor Dapo Abiodun is yet to assent the Animal Grazing Regulation and Cattle Ranch Establishment Bill 2020 passed last month by the Ogun State\u2019s House of Assembly.\n\nThe bill passed on July 8 puts offenders at the risk of three-year jail term.\n\nWaheed Odusile, commissioner for Information in Ogun State, told BusinessDay that he could not comment on the issue at the moment, adding that he would make further findings.\n\nSimilar situation exists in Osun State where Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has not signed the anti-open grazing bill recently passed by the Osun State House of Assembly.\n\nThe Osun Animal Grazing Regulation and Cattle Ranches Establishment Bill 2021 was passed by the Assembly after its third reading with stakeholders and political leaders applauding the decision.\n\nThe move to ban open-grazing is coming amid plans by President Buhari to recover grazing routes across Nigeria. The President recently approved recommendations of a committee to review 368 grazing sites, across 25 states in the country, and to determine the level of encroachment.\n\nIn the last few weeks, several groups and individuals have urged Southern Governors to forge ahead with their plan.\n\nThe Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by Jare Ajayi, national publicity secretary, after a meeting at the Ijebu-Ode home of its leader, Ayo Adebanjo, asked Southwest governors to move ahead to enact the anti-open grazing law in their respective states.\n\nThe group bemoaned the worsening spate of insecurity in the country and indiscriminate influx of people to the region, calling on the Federal Government to allow the take-off of state police.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cIt is a known fact that Afenifere strongly stands by the Southern Governors in their resolution on anti-grazing laws. We commend the steps taken by governors of the South West on the establishment of security networks like Amotekun. We urge them to continue to forge ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfenifere noted with serious concern the unprecedented security problems accentuated by the influx of people even from outside Nigeria. Some of them are disguised as Okada riders. We call on the government and security agencies to put a halt to the unbridled influx of people with questionable intentions,\u201d part of the statement read.\n\nObservers have commended the governors for the decision to ban open-grazing in the region, they say such an idea was not feasible in view of the population of Nigeria and security challenges bedevilling Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, amid insinuations in some quarters that the passing of such law was a violation of the fundamental human rights of herders to move freely and associate within Nigeria, Martin Ogunleye, a former Lagos State chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), dismissed such insinuations, saying that the anti-open grazing law does not stop individuals or herders from moving, associating within Nigeria, but saying that anyone engage in cattle rearing should confine them in certain location.\n\nOgunleye noted that the idea of open cattle rearing was obsolete, unpratisable in the modern era, and should be discarded in view of the population of Nigeria and the security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAgriculture is not under the exclusive list; so, the state and Federal Government can make law on it. The responsibility of any government is to make law that would benefit the people. If the state feels open-grazing is no longer invoked and dangerous, they can make such a law.\n\n\u201cAlmost all the governors are buying into the idea that open grazing is no more feasible in this modern time. If some governors pass a law against that it cannot be seen to be an exercise in illegality; because they have an obligation to protect the people.\n\n\u201cThe law does not violate anybody\u2019s fundamental rights, because it is not saying you cannot move; they are saying do ranch to protect your animal like other countries of the world.\u201d\n\nOgunleye further said: \u201cIt is not a violation of human rights. For example, we have a law now, that no one should move from 12am; is that a violation of Nigerians rights? It is because of Covid-19, and the government does that for public interest. So that people would not party late and spread it.\n\n\u201cOpen grazing was popular then, not now; what was our population then? I mean in this modern age, it is insane to still be talking about that. In view of this, the spate of insecurity is not desirable.\u201d\n\nOther senior Nigerians have consistently spoken in support of the ban on open-grazing.\n\nMike Ozekhome, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said the idea of open-grazing was old-fashioned that must be discarded in Nigeria.\n\nHe welcomed the enactment of a law banning open-grazing across the Southern states, while condemning those opposed to the law.\n\n\u201cThey may probably be afraid that the South has finally woken up and shaken off its Stockholm syndrome,\u201d Ozekhome had said.\n\nHis Eminence, Emmanuel Josiah Udofia, Primate of the African Church, frowned at the idea of reviving open grazing at this time, saying those in cattle rearing business should bother about how to take care of their cattle.\n\n\u201cThe national grazing routes, I think, is what most Nigerians have been talking about. I think this open grazing should not be a Federal Government issue because I believe taking care of the cows and others \u2013 these animals- are owned by individuals; they are not owned by the Federal Government. A situation where the Federal Government now decides to take it as a policy, which is what many people are talking about \u2013 it\u2019s as if the whole country is rearing cows. So, I think our President should lead us and know that he is a father to all Nigerians. Our President should see himself as a father to all, irrespective of where anybody comes from as far as the person is a Nigerian, and have deep interest and concern for what each Nigerian is doing,\u201d Udofia said.\n\n\u2018Some governors are chickening out\u2019\n\nSome analysts have also expressed disappointment over the decision of some governors to step back from the agreement.\n\nA man, who simply identified himself as Jude for security reasons, said he was appalled at the behavior of some governors in the South East towards the law.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised at the behaviours of governors of Imo, Anambra and Ebonyi states. They brought politics into the whole thing. Look at Imo and Ebonyi where the killings have been intense, one should have expected that the governors would be the first to promulgate the law to check the orgy of killing, but look at what is coming from there. It is evident that these are not leaders. They sacrifice the lives of their people for selfish reasons,\u201d Jude said.\n\nPublic Affairs Analyst, Kunle Okunade has flatly condemned the refusal of some states to pass the anti-grazing law, stressing that such governors were only working to impress the President and not the people they pledge to serve and protect.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt about how important a law to check open-grazing has become in view of the frequent clashes between farmers and herders across Nigeria, but because in Nigeria, we shy away from the real issues to pursue unnecessary things.\n\n\u201cAnd it is even surprising that some governors are with the President who supports open grazing. Look at the killings in Ebonyi, are you not surprised that the governor is opposed to the idea because he wants to please the President?\u201d Okunade said.",
          "summary": "About eight states- Ekiti, Ondo, Abia, Oyo, Delta, Enugu, Bayelsa, and Rivers- have enacted laws banning open grazing.\nThere is nothing on ground to indicate that anti-open grazing law is underway in Cross River, Ebonyi, Imo and Anambra states.\nThe Anambra State government had consistently said it had no plan to enact anti-open grazing law in the state because of \u201cthe cordial relationship with herders\u201d in the state.\nUzodimma was reported to have said that there was no law forbidding open grazing by cattle rearers in Imo State.\n\u201cAlmost all the governors are buying into the idea that open grazing is no more feasible in this modern time.",

          "title": "Why Nigerian politicians dread leaving office",
          "text": "The ordeal Wednesday of the former minister of Power, Sale Mamman who was reported to have collapsed on hearing the news of his sack by President Muhammadu Buhari is a sad story of Nigerian politicians who have no second address outside politics.\n\nThe former minister was said to have been taken by surprise by the announcement of his sack. Some reports said he must have been hard hit by the development because of the \u201cenjoyment\u2019 in the office he never thought was going to end so soon.\n\nAlthough Mamman has since denied he collapsed, saying he had been ill and had been receiving treatment before the sack was announced, it has been discovered that Nigerian politicians degenerate very fast a soon as they leave office.\n\nApart from the recent case of the sacked minister, it has been observed that as soon as these politicians get into a situation that tasks their stress level, they usually cave in.\n\nBut the Nigerian masses who have been bearing the brunt of their maladministration have continued to move on, looking healthier than their \u201coppressors\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Politicians sidestep Nigeria\u2019s economic mess, set eyes on 2023\n\nSometime ago, a former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) collapsed while answering questions before federal lawmakers in Abuja.\n\nThere have been cases where highly placed individuals in politics have had to throw up openly in the courtroom as they are being arraigned for one case of fraud or the other.\n\nSome of them have been seen going paralysed momentarily and were wheeled into the court on stretchers and wheelchairs.\n\nIt has also been discovered that a number of them do not enjoy sound health immediately they leave office, despite the money and property they have acquired while in office.\n\nIn Nigeria as in some other African countries, many politicians never retire; even when they are old and are no longer useful in the system, they always prefer to die in the corridors of power.\n\nA few politicians only go back to their original trade after their exit from politics.\n\nOnly a few move on with their lives without hanging around the power corridors of Nigeria looking from crumbs from the masters\u2019 tables.\n\nSome of those who have moved on to other meaningful things include Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (former Finance Minister); Akinwumi Adesina (former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development), and Arunma Oteh (ex-Director General, Securities and Exchange Commission), these are now playing on the global stage.\n\nUnlike in some other places in the world where professionals who ventured into politics go back to their trades after their tenures in government, Nigerian politicians after they leave office continue to hang around the seat of power and refuse to engage in other meaningful jobs. At best, they become overnight contractors and consultants.\n\nIn advanced democracies where governors contest for higher position as President, the reverse is the case in this part of the world; after serving two-terms as governor, an average Nigerian politician contests for senatorial seat not necessarily for service but as \u2018pension\u2019 to remain relevant in politics.\n\nWhile a school-of-thought considers the development as a \u2018demotion and retrogression\u2019, another school-of-thought disagrees, insisting that politicians who have tasted higher political offices and taking responsibility at a lower level would bring their wealth of experience into such positions.\n\nTo career politicians, politics is seen as an end in itself and not a means to an end.\n\nAn Abuja-based political analyst, Taiye Odewale, told our correspondent that Nigerian politicians strive to hold on to public offices not because of genuine service to their community but to the fact that politicians now see politics as the fastest means to financial empowerment.\n\nHe said: \u201cPolitics in this part of the world is one of the easiest ways to immediate fortune. If you are a politician and you are lucky to stand for election and you win at whatever level \u2013 be it from counsellorship level to presidency \u2013 definitely the person will have a sudden turnaround in terms of material wealth far above his or her peers who remain in their profession. His peers may improve on the average but his own will be a catapulted one. And he won\u2019t want to drop back to their level.\n\n\u201cAnd you know, we have a very wrong value here. Anyone who succeeds in winning election into public office is already rated very high in the society. He will not want to go back. For example if the person came from the classroom like Ibrahim Shekarau (former governor and Minister) did in Kano, so you expect him to go back to the classroom as a secondary school teacher?\u201d\n\nAnalysts say it is the fear of the unknown that normally drive them into seeking to hang in on political position till death.\n\n\u201cIt is that fear of tomorrow that makes the governors to want to go to the Senate, just to sit idly and wile away time. Some of them even prefer to die there in \u2018active service\u2019 to dying as ordinary people. It is a phobia,\u201d Matthew Onyendi, an economist, said.\n\n\u201cAgain, most Nigerian politicians do not have a second address. These are those who were not doing well in business before finding their way into politics. Some of them have hospitals and other businesses that are still on, but they have so much seen free money that they no longer value the trickles from their businesses. So, they are always thinking what would happen if they leave office. It is the nature of man.\n\n\u201cSometimes, if you look at them, despite the money they have, they are not happy; they are always agitated and insecure. Their outward look does not show the money they make because some of this money does not come the right way. The poor are being denied while the politicians amass the wealth. The money itself becomes a torment. I think it\u2019s a spiritual thing,\u201d he further said.\n\nDoyin Odubanjo, a public health expert, said: \u201cThey probably increased their spending so much while in office that it was difficult to cut down on it on leaving. Hence, with dwindling inflow, their high-maintenance lifestyle quickly consumes all that they have.\u201d\n\nAnother observer, who did not want her name in print, also believes that the major problem with politicians is their lifestyle.\n\n\u201cPoliticians, the Nigerian type, are always showing off. They are wasteful. You see one person building a residential house that covers acres, just to show he has made it. He heeds constant inflow of huge amount of money to maintain that property. Some people have it two or three in the country and outside. So, they are always thinking about how to maintain their excesses. A very few of them that understand this life, live modest life and are not under pressure. For those who do not have a second address, a dislocation in the chain of their financial inflows causes a heart attack and sudden death,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also alluded to the alleged reason why the sacked Mamman collapsed on hearing about his removal.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cMost of the politicians are involved in dirty deals that attract the excess money they make for themselves using their office. If for instance, a minister has set a business rolling and he is expecting several millions of naira to role in as kick back (which they are known for anyway), and it does not happen, it could cause heart ache. In fact, it can even lead to sudden death.\u201d",

          "title": "Need for President Buhari to provide crude oil for Edo modular refinery \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nI want to appeal to President Buhari to as matter of urgency provide crude oil to Edo modular refinery to enable it start operation. Edo modular refinery is ready and waiting for crude oil from Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) facility \u2013 oil mining lease (OML) 111 NNPC to starting operation. There is no explanation from NNPC for its delay to provide crude oil to Edo modular refinery. I am appealing to President Buhari to provide crude oil to Edo modular refinery since NNPC cannot perform its function. Edo modular refinery, Ologbo is very close (OML) 111 yet it cannot get crude oil to start its production. Edo modular refinery needs crude before it becomes an abandon project because NNPC cannot give it crude oil to refine. I see it as an attempt to frustrate Governor Obaseki. Nigeria is an oil producing country yet NNPC cannot give Edo modular refinery to refine. It is difficult to believe that in this era of subsidy payment, NNPC cannot provide crude oil for Edo modular refinery to start operation. My special appeal to President Buhari is to give crude oil to Edo modular refinery at Ologbo to start its operation.\n\nIf President Buhari can give Edo modular refinery now, Edo Modular refinery will increase crude oil production from 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd. The project is being developed by two Chinese firms; AIPCC Energy Limited and the Peiyang Chemical Equipment Company Limited. Governor Obaseki has developed keen interest in this project. Edo is the only state that can boast of two modular refineries that cannot get crude oil from NNPC TO REFINE.\n\nOperations have commenced and waiting for crude from President Buhari since NNPC cannot give it crude. The first phase will produce 1,000 bpd, while the second phase will produce 6,000 bpd; with a long-term goal of producing 60,000 bpd.\n\nPhase one \u2013 which is completed \u2013 will target a production ratio comprising 55% diesel, 38% fuel oil and less than 10% naphtha. \u201cSome of the products will be exported to boost foreign exchange earnings and by the time the refinery extends it into different phases, it would be able to take care of more than 80% of diesel requirement in Nigeria. The investment will benefit the Edo people through job creation, increased revenue and ease of pressure on other refineries.\n\nThe goal of modularization in the oil and gas market is to reduce capital costs, accelerate delivery schedules, and to efficiently minimize field construction, thereby ensuring every project is on schedule, budget, and scope. Edo modular refinery has been waiting since July, 2021 to commence operation and NNPC has refused to supply crude oil to Edo modular refinery. This is a key legacy project by the Gov. Godwin Obaseki-led administration to recalibrate the state\u2019s industrial base, birthed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo state, said in July,2021 that the modular refinery located in Ologbo, Ikpoba\u2013Okha LGA, is ready for production. The refinery was developed by two Chinese firms: AIPCC Energy Limited and Peiyang Chemical Equipment Company Limited. It has a capacity of 6,000 barrels per day and it is expected to produce 50 percent of diesel (500,000 litres), 25 percent of naphtha (300,000 litres) and 20 percent of fuel oil (200,000 litres) from its feedstock.\n\n\u2018\u2019We were in China to sign this Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). I am very impressed that work has moved at such a speed in spite of the delay caused by COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Obaseki said during a recent visit to the facility. \u201cThe plant is ready to receive crude oil; it is ready to process and it is ready to deliver products. They have done the pre-commission with the Department of Petroleum Resources, they have certified the refinery. \u201cWhat we have left now is to finalise the crude oil sale contract, these facilities have to get a certain type of crude from the escravos line and that is being finalised.\n\nWith President Buhari\u2019s instruction to DPR and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, to provide all necessary support in securing oil and condensate feedstock for the Edo modular refinery, there are expecations that the project will be a success. Edo Modular Energy refinery is set to increase crude oil production from 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd if President Buhari can give it crude oil to refine.\n\nI want to draw Chief Sylva antention to Edo modular refinery initiative which will promote availability of petroleum products in the country, conserve foreign exchange utilisation for the importation of petroleum products, promote socio-economic development in order to stop restiveness, criminal and illegal refinery activities thereby sustaining peaceful co-existence in the Niger Delta and mitigate environmental degradation associated with illegal refinery activities, crude oil theft and pipelines vandalism, then Nigerians are on their way to the Promised Land.\n\nEdo modular refinery has adequate refining capacity and meets all the criteria, hence the opportunities for modular refineries because they are simple, fast to start up and usually operating at optimal capacity. In theory, this is an advantage over larger refineries. It can also commence production with a small capacity of 5,000BPSD or 10,000BPSD, and grow its capacity over time by adding more modules.\n\nAs part of its strategy to reposition the oil and gas industry, President Buhari in 2016 launched a roadmap of short and medium-term priorities aimed at developing a stable and enabling the oil and gas landscape with improved transparency, efficiency, stable investment climate and a well-protected environment tagged \u201c7big wins\u201d. The fourth initiative in the roadmap, \u201cRefineries and local production capacity\u201d seeks to transit Nigeria from being an import-dependent nation into a net exporter of refined petroleum products through the modular refineries as vehicle.\n\nThis is seen as one of the ways and means of tackling non-availability of petroleum products. This much was evidenced when President Buhari performed the virtual inauguration of the National Oil and Gas Excellence Centre on January 21, this year. One of the issues he spoke about was modular refinery.\n\n__________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Ologbo, Edo State \u2013 inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\n...",

Gbenga Elegbeleye for a job well done.\n\nHe said what should be paramount in the heart of every member of the party now is how to re-elect governor Adegboyega Oyetola for the good work to continue.\n\nOyebamiji urged the newly sworn in local government executives to work round the clock in ensuring unity within the party, saying that unity will remain the only bedrock for the success of the party in 2022 election.\n\nHe, however, implored all the aggrieved members of the party to embrace peace and work hamoniously with the newly sworn in executives for the betterment of all.\n\nIn his remarks after the conclusion of the exercise, Hon Arimiyau Owoade, who returned as party chairman in the local government, thanked the leaders and members of the party on behalf of other members of Exco, for the confidence reposed in them.\n\nCommittee Express Satisfaction\n\nSimilarly, members of the National Committee on Local Government Congress of the party expressed satisfaction over the peaceful conduct of the party\u2019s members in the State.\n\nThe Committee affirmed that there was no parallel congress anywhere in the State except on Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nIt also expressed delight wuth the way and manner the party\u2019s supporters and loyalists trooped out en masse to exercise their right of electing new officers of the party across the Local Governments of the State.\n\nRecall that the national leadership of the ruling party under the leadership of Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee had earlier resolved and directed the conduct of the Local Government Congresses across the 774 Councils in the country.\n\nThe members of the party\u2019s national delegation for the Local Government Congress to Osun had on Friday, held a stakeholders\u2019 meeting at the party\u2019s secretariat, where they charged members to exhibit the Omoluabi ethos for which Osun is known for and promised to conduct a hitch-free and credible exercise.\n\nBy Saturday morning, they visited some of the Councils where they monitored, supervised and observed the conduct of the Congress.\n\nAmong the Councils visited as at the time of filing the report were Osogbo Local Government, Boripe Local Government and Boluwaduro Local Government.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the members of the Committee, the Committee\u2019s Chairman, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, lauded the peaceful conduct of the party loyalists, describing it as commendable and worthwhile.\n\nElegbeleye who commended the consensus model adopted by the leadership of the party, said there was no parallel congress anywhere as against the insinuations making the rounds.\n\nAccording to him, nothing like parallel congress was either seen or observed by the Committee in any of the visited places or being reported by the Committee members observing and supervising the election process in any of the Councils in the State.\n\n\u201cWe have been to several places. We have been to Osogbo, Boripe, Boluwaduro among others, and we met very large crowd where consensus was adopted as model to which the new officers were elected by the party\u2019s members,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThings were very perfect; the atmosphere was peaceful and we were very impressed by the way and manner which the people conducted and comported themselves peacefully without any rancour whatsoever.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, consensus is what the party has always subscribed to and this is what was largely adopted in the State, and with what we have seen so far, there is nothing like parallel anywhere except on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe are very glad to witness this Congress in a peaceful atmosphere as this is in line with the principles of our party.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks during the visit of the members of the Committee to his Council in Iragbiji, Boripe Local Government, Governor Oyetola applauded the members of the party across the State for allowing peace to reign.\n\nHe attributed the atmosphere of peace to the existing show of love and the spirit of togetherness reigning in the party, saying it was a reflection of the fact that the party members were united and formidable.\n\n\u201cI thank the members of the party for the sense of duty, love and peace that have been observed so far. This is to show that our party is united absolutely.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the members of the Committee for being very fair and efficient in discharging their responsibility. We are very proud of you. I congratulate the newly elected executives. This is a call to service.\n\n\u201cYou must serve with the fear of God. As you all know, the party\u2019s members have reposed confidence in you and you must justify this and you must not disappoint them,\u201d Oyetola added.",

Sixty-four per cent of individuals arrested are involved in romance scams, followed closely by \u2018MiddleMan Scam\u2019 and \u2018Picking,\u2019 which account for eight and seven per cent, respectively, of those arrested.\n\n\u201cThe 64 per cent involved in the dating scam benefitted to the tune of N8, 310,000; $349,290; \u00a3 900; \u20ac10 and Cryptocurrency 0.17513.\u201d\n\nOther types of fraud identified include forgery, possession of fraudulent documents, spamming, credit card fraud, impersonation, rental scam, loan fraud, Business Email Compromise, hacking, stealing, cheque scam, phishing, and money laundering.\n\nThe data also reveals gift cards, at 39 per cent, as the prevalent method employed by the suspects to access their illicit funds, followed by bank transfers at 27 per cent and Cryptocurrency at 21 per cent.\n\n\u201cA total of $12,512.49 was recovered from the e-wallet accounts of four suspects within the period,\u201d Uwujaren said",

          "text": "A recently-evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Maria Chike, has said that though she considered another contestant, Pere, as a friend in the house, she would not have anything to do with him outside the show because he was not genuine towards her.\n\nSpeaking about their relationship, she told Sunday Scoop, \u201cFor people who actually watched the show, (they would know that) Pere was the one insisting to be around me. He was always in my space, so if it was a strategy, I would have been the one going to him. You would never see a clip where I was the one constantly trying to be around him. So many times, I told him I had a boyfriend outside the house. I actually went into the show single and it was because of Pere, I said I had a boyfriend because I needed him to understand that we were only going to be friends. I enjoyed our friendship and I loved the attention he gave me.\n\n\u201cHowever, BBN is over to me. I don\u2019t have to clarify anything with Pere anymore because we already had that conversation in the house. I don\u2019t want to indulge my name and Pere\u2019s name ever in my life. He said different things I didn\u2019t know about. He told some of the guys that I was a no-go-area and that he would look for someone else to have sex with because he knew I won\u2019t yield. That\u2019s not friendship. His motive was to have sex with me but I told him that would never happen. He was someone I could always confide in but he clearly wanted more. When I came out, I saw some video clips of what he said, not just the rumours going round. He even said I was a psycho. Why would I want to continue to be his friend?\u201d\n\nShe also stated vehemently that there was no form of intimacy between her and Pere. She added, \u201cThere was no way the camera would not have shown what happened because they are always on us. It\u2019s true the TV doesn\u2019t show everything because they choose certain clips but I assure you, there is no camera that would have caught Pere and I being intimate. Whatever claims he is pushing out there, have nothing to do with me. I would like to clarify that and get my name out of that narrative.\u201d\n\nMaria also maintained that Queen, who she never got along with, was the one who always attacked her. She said, \u201cI cannot really talk much because there is nothing there. Queen attacked me on the two occasions we had altercations. There was never anywhere I went to her to start a fight. When I\u2019m at fault, I take ownership of my fault. I said things about people that were not true. If those people find those things offensive, I\u2019m truly sorry. But in the case of Queen, she came with a strategy. She already knew what was going on in the house. She came for me as a strategy in the house. I don\u2019t want to associate my name with her because we are two different individuals. I think everyone should just let me be in peace.\n\nThough some viewers felt she stated that she found Cross sexually attractive, Maria disagreed. She said, \u201cI did not find Cross sexually attractive. I said he was a very attractive guy. I never had anything to do with him. We were like siblings. When one admires another person, it doesn\u2019t mean one likes them in a sexual way.\u201d\n\nMaria also stated that she was rooting for Liqourose and that if she didn\u2019t make it to the top five, she would support Whitemoney.\n\nShe also stated that having left the house, she was looking forward to \u2018working with reputable brands an ambassadors\u2019 doing more in the entertainment industry and opening a daycare because of her love for kids.\n\nThe former air hostess also stated that though she often spoke with different accents in the house, she was not being fake. She added, \u201cI am half-Nigerian and half-British. I speak Igbo, \u2018Nigerian English\u2019 and pidgin. I speak the way I want to. Whose problem is it how I speak? I love how I speak. If anybody didn\u2019t, they had the option of turning off their TV sets.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "SERAP to ICC: Hold Buhari, Matawalle liable for school abductions",
          "text": "The persistent failure of Nigerian authorities at both the federal and state levels to end school abductions amounts to crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) made this submission in a petition to the ICC on Saturday.\n\nIt was the first time that an organisation has asked the ICC to hold accountable President Buhari, Governor Bello Matawalle, other governors and security agencies for failing to protect schoolchildren from bandits.\n\nIn a petition directed to Mr Karim A. A. Khan, ICC prosecutor, the organization urges him \u201cto investigate the growing cases of abduction of students in several parts of Northern Nigeria.\n\nSERAP also calls on ICC \u201cto push for those suspected to be responsible and complicit in the commission of these serious crimes, to be invited and tried by the ICC.\u201d\n\nThe petition, dated 4 September 2021 was signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, is coming following a string of abductions and closure of schools in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThese include the recent closure of schools in Zamfara State after scores of students were abducted by gunmen from a state-run high school in Maradun district.\n\nAccording to the organization, the ICC\u2019s investigation will help combat impunity, deter future human rights abuses, and improve access of children to education.\n\nSERAP said: \u201cDepriving children their right to education has severe consequences for their ability to access their fundamental rights. The severe and lifelong harms that result from depriving children the right to education satisfy the gravity of harm threshold under the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestigating and declaring cases of abduction of Nigerian students and closure of schools, and the failure by the Nigerian authorities to provide safe and enabling learning environments as crimes against humanity would help to combat impunity, deter future human rights abuses, and improve access of the children to education.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cpersistent and discriminatory denial of education to girls is a crime against humanity. Repeated abductions, the absence of safe and enabling learning environments, and the resulting closure of schools give rise to individual criminal responsibility under the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\nThe petition, read in part: \u201cThe crime of abduction is not just a deprivation of a single fundamental human right, but a wholesale effort to re-engineer society and to deny children, including girls their human dignity and agency in all aspects of their lives. Lack of education for girls and women has been shown to have negative impacts on their children and family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe persistent failure by Nigerian authorities to end the widespread and systemic abductions, and to provide safe and enabling learning environments for Nigerian children to enjoy their right to quality education amounts to crimes against humanity, which fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian authorities have primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute the alleged crimes of abduction of students, they have repeatedly failed and/or neglected to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe absence of any tangible and relevant investigation or prosecution in Nigeria suggests that the authorities are unwilling or unable to carry out genuine investigation or prosecution of those suspected to be responsible for and complicit in the abduction of students.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequences of persistent abductions of students, closure of schools, and the failure to provide safe and enabling learning environments despite federal and state authorities yearly budgeting some N241.2 billion of public funds as \u201csecurity votes\u201d, are similar to those of the offences in article 7(1).\u201d\n\n\u201cSenior government officials know well or ought to know that their failure to prevent these crimes will violate the children\u2019s human rights and dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned about the growing reports of abduction of Nigerian students and closure of schools in several parts of Nigeria. As Nigeria is a State Party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity committed on the territory of Nigeria or by its nationals.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP therefore urges you to conclude that on the basis of available information, the acts of abduction of students and closure of schools in many parts of Northern Nigeria constitute crimes against humanity within the meaning of the Rome Statute of the ICC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Rome Statute in article 7 defines \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d to include \u201cinhumane acts causing great suffering or injury,\u201d committed in a widespread or systematic manner against a civilian population. The common denominator of crimes against humanity is that they are grave affronts to human security and dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ICC should recognize depriving children including girls of the right to education is an inhumane act under Article 7 that brings comparable suffering and harm to its victims as other crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe OTP\u2019s Policy on Children recognizes that children are an \u201cidentifiable group or collectivity\u201d and \u201ctargeting [them] on the basis of age or birth may be charged as persecution on \u2018other grounds.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that only children of the poor attend schools that are often targeted for abductions and closures suggests that the cases highlighted in this petition fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC on \u2018other grounds\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP believes that substantial grounds exist to warrant the intervention of the Prosecutor in this case, as provided for under Article 17 of the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 10,000 schools have been reportedly closed in at least seven northern states over the fear of attack and abduction of pupils and members of staff. The states are Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Niger and Yobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchools in Nigeria\u2019s north-western Zamfara State have been ordered closed after scores of students were abducted by gunmen from a state-run high school in Zamfara\u2019s Maradun district.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong the string of abductions in Zamfara was the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls in the town of Jangebe in February. The latest abduction comes after widespread reports of abduction of students and closure of schools in many states of Nigeria, including in north-central Niger State where some 91 schoolchildren were abducted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn estimated 1.3 million Nigerian children have been affected by frequent raids on schools by suspected terrorists. Some 13 million Nigerian children are out of school nationwide. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), more than 1,000 students have been abducted from schools in northern Nigeria since December 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cFamilies and parents have reportedly resulted to paying the terrorists thousands of dollars as ransom to secure the release of their children. An estimated $18.34 million was reportedly paid in ransoms between June 2011 and the end of March 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities have also failed and/or neglected to satisfactorily address the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in 2014, which prompted the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. According to reports, more than 100 of those girls are still missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, pursuant to the Rome Statute, the Prosecutor has power to intervene in a situation under the jurisdiction of the Court if the Security Council or states parties refer a situation or if information is provided from other sources such as the information SERAP is providing in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP believes that the ICC exists as a constant reminder of states\u2019 responsibility to combat serious crimes and impunity. The alleged crimes against humanity in Nigeria merit the Court\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged Mr Khan to urgently commence an investigation proprio motu on the widespread and systematic problem of abductions of Nigerian students.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, we also urge you to invite representatives of the Nigerian government, the governors of states affected to provide written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court, so that the Prosecutor is able to conclude whether there is a reasonable basis for an investigation, and to submit a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authorization of an investigation;\n\n\u201cEnsure the mission by OTP officials to Nigeria for evaluative purposes;\n\n\u201cBring to justice those suspected to be responsible for widespread and systematic abductions, failures to provide a safe learning environment for the children, and the resulting closure of schools in many states.\n\n\u201cUrge the Nigerian government to fulfill its obligations under the Rome Statute to cooperate with the ICC; including complying with your requests to arrest and surrender suspected perpetrators and those directly or indirectly complicit in the crimes, testimony, and provide other support to the ICC.\n\n\u201cCompel the Nigerian authorities to ensure that Nigerian children are afforded their rights to life, dignity, and quality education in a safe learning environment, and to ensure reparations to victims, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and guarantee of non-repetition.\n\n\u201cEncourage Nigerian authorities to implement the provisions of the Rome Statute as part of a general strategy to strengthen the national jurisdiction to assure that they can efficiently investigate and prosecute cases of abduction of children prohibited by the Rome Statute.",
          "summary": "The persistent failure of Nigerian authorities at both the federal and state levels to end school abductions amounts to crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) made this submission in a petition to the ICC on Saturday.\nIt was the first time that an organisation has asked the ICC to hold accountable President Buhari, Governor Bello Matawalle, other governors and security agencies for failing to protect schoolchildren from bandits.\nA. Khan, ICC prosecutor, the organization urges him \u201cto investigate the growing cases of abduction of students in several parts of Northern Nigeria.\nSome 13 million Nigerian children are out of school nationwide.",

          "text": "Afenifere, a Yoruba socio-cultural organization, has condemned the assassination of Olajide Sowore, the younger brother of Omoyele Sowore, a human rights campaigner.\n\nOlajide was murdered in cold blood by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen on Saturday on the Lagos-Benin Expressway, Okada area of Edo State.\n\nBefore his death, he was a student of Igbinedion University, Okada, where he was studying Pharmacy.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Secretary General of the group, Sola Ebiseni attributed the death of Olajide to the failure of the Nigerian government to tackle the menace of insecurity in the country, particularly that which is fuelled by killer-herders.\n\nHe also condemned the refusal of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to embrace lasting solutions postulated by men and women of goodwill.\n\nEbiseni noted that Funke Olakunri, daughter of the leader of Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasonranti, was also killed by herders on the same highway as he stated that their blood and that of hundreds of Nigerians killed in similar ways lie on the neck of the government.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIt is an understatement that we are under siege and a truism that Nigeria has lost the essential attributes of a State, which is the security of life and property.\n\n\u201cThe killing of Olajide Sowore along the Lagos-Benin Expressway, by herdsmen, is one too many of our able-bodied youngsters being killed in their prime while those entrusted with our collective safety feign helplessness and most pathetically have refused all entreaties on solutions by men and women of goodwill.\n\n\u201cWe recall that it was on this highway that herdsmen snuffed life out of Mrs. Funke Olakunri, lawyer, banker and also in her 50s, daughter of the Leader of Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasonranti.\n\n\u201cThe people of Nigeria, the vast majority of who are farmers, had long given up such economic activities as a result of the occupation of their land, destruction of their crops, harvests; raping of their daughters and mothers and killings of the defenceless men. In the same vein, neither roads, schools, any place, homes nor anywhere is, in any way, safe.\n\n\u201cAll suggestions and efforts by the people and governments of the states, particularly of southern Nigeria, which include requests for State Police and ban of open grazing of animals, have been deliberately frustrated by the Buhari administration, which argues instead in favour of the freedom of movements of animals and their herders across Nigeria, even from all over Africa.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, Sunday Igboho, for daring to speak out against the killings of his people, by this same herdsmen, is being hunted and those who share his views killed less than dogs, by security forces who work for killer herdsmen and also permit them to bear weapons more sophisticated than those of the security forces.\n\n\u201cThe herdsmen undermine the constitution with impunity by not obeying anti-grazing laws already made and brazenly declaring disobedience to those being made, knowing that they have the support of the Federal Government for such treasonable acts and virtuperations.\n\n\u201cThe blood of Olajide unfortunately further adds to those of the hundreds of thousands of Nigerians, killed by the pampered herdsmen.\n\n\u201cTheir blood is on the neck and hands of this government, crying for justice, further soaking the nation\u2019s flag which drips ceaselessly still with the blood of Nigerians killed by herdsmen and their ethnic militias and those armless youths, who were hacked down by security forces for agitating for police reforms.\u201d",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

          "title": "Nigeria Governors Caution FG over Payment of $418m Paris Club Refund to Six Consultants",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has cautioned the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the federal government against going ahead with the planned payment of the sum of $418 million to some individuals and organisations for the roles they played in the Paris Club refund received by the federal government.\n\nThe governors have also warned all chief executives/managing directors and chief compliance officers of Nigeria\u2019s commercial banks against implementing the directives to pay the said sum to the affected parties.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was said to have approved the payment of the controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors, without considering the governors\u2019 calls for a forensic audit into the claims of the creditors.\n\nFollowing Buhari\u2019s approval, the Federal Ministry of Finance was also said to have directed the Debt Management Office (DMO) to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors, as approved by the president.\n\nBut the NGF, in the warning letter to the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN); Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; and the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms. Patience Oniha, questioned the rationale behind the payment of the alleged debt to the said consultants and contractors.\n\nThe governors argued that the said payment is already an issue of litigation.\n\nThe governors in the \u201cCaveat\u201d letter dated Friday, September 3, 2021, also wondered why the federal government was in a rush to make such payment to individuals at a time when both the federal and state governments need funds for provisions of critical infrastructure for the people.\n\nThe letter signed on behalf of the NGF by its lawyer, Mr. PH Ogbole (SAN), also warned all chief executives/managing directors and chief compliance officers of Nigeria commercial banks against giving effect to any directive regarding the payment of the said sum to the affected parties.\n\nOgbole, in the letter titled, \u201cCaveat on the Payment of $418 million Suspicious Debts\u201d, argued that since the federal government was aware of the current court cases challenging the payment of the alleged debts, it ought not to take any further steps on the matter.\n\nAccording to the senior lawyer, the governors on August 3, 2021, got wind of the federal government\u2019s move to effect the payment.\n\nHe noted that the governors learnt that some consultants/contractors alleged that they were retained by some states and had done some work for the states and local governments in Nigeria about the Paris Club refund.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance is said to have directed the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO) to issue Promissory Notes in favour of the Consultants. The purported amounts claimed by the various consultants are as follows: Ned Nwoko \u2013 $142,028,941; Ted Iseghoghi Edwards -$159 million; Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 $142,028,941.95 and Panic Alert System Limited and George Uboh \u2013 $47,831,920\u201d, Ogbole explained.\n\nHe explained that the consultants relied on judgments of the Federal High Court which are presently being challenged by the 36 governors in several actions in various courts.\n\nHe identified the cases to include suits number FHC/ Abj/CS/123/2018 between Panic Alert Security Systems Limited & Anor Vs Trustees of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum & 3 Others; FHC/ABJ/CS/453/2021 between\n\nTrustees of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum Vs Panic Alert Security Systems Limited & Anor (5 others); and M/3542/2021 between Riok Nigeria Limited Vs The Trustees of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum\n\nThe senior lawyer added that some of the consultants have already joined issues with the NGF, while the matters have been set down for hearing on September 28 and 29, 2021.\n\nHe further claimed that the Minister of Finance, the DG of DMO, and the AGF had since been duly served and notified of the pendency of these actions in court in different letters written by counsel to the NGF.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore strange and indeed alarming that having been served and made aware of the pendency of the various court cases, the Minister of Finance would readily but in complete disregard of the law direct that Promissory Notes be issued in favour of the consultants\u201d, he said.\n\nWhile arguing that custodians and managers of public funds are public trustees and must at all times act in the public interest, he stressed that the interest of all the states and local governments of the federation is involved in this instant case and ought to be protected by the Minister of Finance.\n\nOgbole added that \u201cthe issuance of Promissory Notes of a humongous sum of over $418 million to private persons for alleged consultancy work demands not only caution but strict due diligence, particularly when the judgments which gave rise to the payments sought to be enforced are the subject of pending litigation.\n\n\u201cMatters that are subjudice must not be acted upon in a manner that will foist a situation of complete helplessness on the courts and render their decisions nugatory,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, however, explained that this caveat was issued as a Further Notice to the Minister of Finance and the DG, DMO, to act in the interest of the public and refrain from foisting on the nation another case of P& lD in which, he noted, would have fleeced the nation of billions of dollars but for due diligence.\n\n\u201cThe nation is already going through economic adversity and every dollar is needed to be channelled to people-oriented projects. Public duty and probity demand that public trustees must, at all times, act in the interest of the people they serve to protect their commonwealth.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, justice must be allowed to run its full course.\n\n\u201cAll chief executives of banks and their compliance officers are hereby advised to desist from or otherwise not to accept for exchange or process for payment or giving value to any promissory notes issued by the DMO for purpose of satisfying alleged Paris Club Consultants fees afore-mentioned.\n\n\u201cThe entire public is also notified to be at the high alert of this hasty attempt to circumvent the rule of law and dissipate hard-earned public funds meant for development purposes to private persons on matters which are presently being litigated upon.\n\n\u201cLet no grant be sealed in the funds of the 36 states of the federation and the 774 local government areas in the sums mentioned in this caveat without notice to the caveator (the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum) as the matter of the payments is sub judice,\u201d he added.\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "The crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC) deepened on Saturday as the local government congresses were characterised by protests and the election of parallel executives by different factions of the ruling party in many states.\n\nSome of the affected states include Lagos, Adamawa, Sokoto, Rivers, Oyo, Enugu, Bayelsa, Abia, Ekiti, Ogun, Kwara, Niger, Imo, Akwa Ibom, among others.\n\nDespite an order of a Delta State High Court restraining the party from organising the LG congresses in the state, a faction of the party led by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, organised the exercise which the deputy senate president described as peaceful.\n\nTwo factions of the APC also held parallel congresses in some local government areas in Oyo State.\n\nThe LG congresses did not hold in Anambra, Kaduna and Zamfara.\n\nThe national leadership of the APC had exempted the Anambra State chapter of the party from the congresses to allow the party to prepare very well for the forthcoming governorship election, billed to hold on November 6.\n\nKaduna State did not hold the congresses because of the LG elections that took place in the state.\n\nThe internal crisis within the party and insecurity prevented Saturday\u2019s exercise in Zamfara State\n\nA Delta State High Court sitting in Asaba had on Wednesday restrained the National Chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC and Governor of Yobe State, Mr. Mai Mala Buni, from conducting the LG congresses in the state.\n\nWhile the faction of the party in the state led by Omo-Agege, insisted that the congresses took place yesterday, the other faction of the party, which parades APC chieftains like Chief Great Ogboru, Hon Festus Keyamo, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, Chief Victor Ochei, and Mrs. Mariam Alli insisted that the congresses did not hold because of the subsisting court order.\n\nHowever, a statement by the Chairman, Delta State Local Government Congress Committee, Mr. Matthew Omegara, said that the party was aware of the court ruling, but that the court order only barred the State Chairman of the party, Prophet Jones Erue, from conducting the congresses and not the party officials from the national headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, Omo-Agege last night hailed the conduct of the party\u2019s local government congresses in the state, saying they were peaceful and satisfactory.\n\nOmegara also agreed with Omo-Agege that the exercise was peaceful, adding that INEC and armed security personnel witnessed the exercise.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, supporters of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, and the National Secretary, APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, held parallel congresses in the 31 LGAs of the state.\n\nAkpanudoedehe controls the state chapter of the party.\n\nSome members of the party who spoke to journalists on the condition of anonymity said materials for the congresses were hijacked and taken to unknown places where the elections congresses allegedly took place.\n\nThe spokesperson of APC in the state, Nkereuwem Enyongekere, said the congress was generally peaceful across the state.\n\nIn Sokoto State, THISDAY gathered that two LG executives emerged from the parallel congresses held.\n\nA leader of one faction and member of the House of Representatives representing Gwadabawa/Illela Federal Constituency, Hon. Balarabe Salame told THISDAY that the faction followed the party\u2019s guidelines by obtaining the forms and electing its executives at wards and local governments\u2019 levels.\n\nHe further disclosed that \u201cthe other faction just stayed in somebody\u2019s room and write the names of their executives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m telling you, what they did in the other faction is undemocratic; you can\u2019t deny people of their right to express their franchise,\u201d he added.\n\nSalame and the Speaker of the state house of assembly, Hon. Muhammad Aminu Achida, belongs to one faction, while the former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, and the Minister of Police Affairs, Mr. Maigari Dingyadi belong to another faction led by Wamakko.\n\nAddressing the delegates and members of the party in Bodinga, the headquarters of Bodinga Local Government Area of the state, the police minister said the party in the state in its wisdom adopted consensus.\n\nThe APC congresses were marred by the crisis in Adamawa State as aggrieved party members from Yola North and Yola South LGAs faulted the distribution of election materials to members who were not supposed to handle the materials.\n\nChairman of the Congress Committee, Professor Umar Katsayal, and his committee members narrowly escaped an attack by irate youths when they were about to leave the party\u2019s secretariat.\n\nThe youths stormed the party\u2019s secretariat in their numbers demanding election materials for their zones.\n\nThe senator representing Adamawa Central, Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed Binani also stormed the party secretariat to kick against the process.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that journalists (cameramen) were forced to delete the visuals of the fracas at the party secretariat.\n\nIn Mubi North and other local governments in the state, some APC stakeholders organised their own separate local government congress in their preferred venues.\n\nThe crisis in the Ogun State chapter of the party deepened Saturday as the group loyal to Governor Dapo Abiodun and a faction of the party led by Senator Ibikunle Amosun held parallel congresses across the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nBefore Saturday\u2019s congresses, the two factions of the APC had sworn in the elected executives that emerged from the parallel ward congresses they held in July.\n\nOn the eve of yesterday\u2019s congresses, the seven-man congress committee led by Mr. Wale Ohu had cautioned the APC members in the state against holding parallel congresses.\n\nAddressing journalists after the conduct of the congresses, Ohu emphasised that any congress held outside the supervision of the committee was null and void.\n\nWhile a faction of the party in Ekiti State called Southwest Agenda for Tinubu 2023 presidential poll (SWAGA) had challenged the previous ward congresses, the Ekiti State APC insisted that the local government congresses were undertaken without violating the constitution of the party and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe Secretary of the Ekiti State APC Congress Committee, Mr. Job Femi Akindeke, said the unconfirmed report that SWAGA went to court to challenge the ward congress did not vitiate the outcome of the local government congresses.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that there wasn\u2019t any legal encumbrance to our local government congress. We followed the due process of the law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to our people to exhaust internal mechanisms before resorting to court. The process is still ongoing and the party has not received any court order stopping us from doing what the party is constitutionally empowered to do,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Rivers State chapter of the APC led by the Minister of Transportation also yesterday held what it described as peaceful local government congresses across the 23 LGAs of the state.\n\nThe congresses were boycotted by the supporters of a former Senator representing Rivers East, Senator Magnus Abe.\n\nHowever, the spokesman of the caretaker committee of the party in the state, Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, told THISDAY that the election was peaceful and smooth, adding that the party was now positioned to take over power in the state.\n\nBut a leader of Abe\u2019s faction, who spoke off record, said they boycotted the exercise because it did not follow due process. The faction had rejected the ward congresses of APC held in the state.\n\nThe faction had also submitted a petition to the national secretariat of the party on the development.\n\nIn Niger State, the consensus option adopted by the APC to choose its local government officials hit the rocks in some parts of the state following the insistence by aspirants for election to be held.\n\nThe consensus arrangement was challenged in Chanchaga, Paikoro, Bida Lapai Agaie, among other LGAs.\n\nDespite the emergence of two factions of the party in Enugu State, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama has hailed what he described as the peaceful conduct of the local government congresses in the state.\n\nOnyeama disclosed this in the Udi Local Government Area of the state while briefing journalists on the outcome of the exercise in his council.\n\nThe minister described the process as democracy-in-action, adding that the people were allowed to willingly choose their leaders.\n\nHowever, supporters of the Director-General of the Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr. Osita Okechukwu, did not participate in the exercise held by Onyeama\u2019s faction.\n\nMeanwhile, former Senate President, Dr. Ken Nnamani, has described as fake, a letter purportedly issued by the national leadership of the party, recognising Mr. Ben Nwoye as the state party chairman.\n\nNnamani spoke during the congress in Nkanu West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHe said that the letter which was circulating in the social media and purportedly issued by the Secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe was forged.\n\nIn Imo State, the congresses were conducted by supporters of Governor Hope Uzodimma without the participation of Senator Rochas Okorocha and Senator Ifeanyi Araraume\u2019s camps.\n\nImo State Chairman of the APC loyal to Governor Uzodimma, Chief Marcillinus Nlemigbo, said the exercise was free and fair.\n\nThe two APC factions in Lagos State also held parallel local government congresses across the 245 wards of the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe two congresses were held without any violence as the factions comprising the Tunde Balogun-led group and the Lagos4Lagos group held their separate local government congresses in different venues.\n\nOn the side of the Balogun-led faction, a former member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Ipoola Omisore said the Lagos chapter is returning the party to the people at the grassroots.\n\nIn Agege Local Government Area, the Vice-Chairman, Apex Committee, Lagos4Lagos, Hon. Prince Sunday Ajayi said his group remains the only faction of the Lagos APC that upholds the party\u2019s constitution in the conduct of the congresses.\n\n\u201cWe are two factions in Lagos but Lagos4Lagos is the only faction of the APC that conducted the ward congress. The other side only paraded appointed candidates but we own the population of the party.\n\n\u201cFor instance, they held local government election; Lagos APC registered 2.5 million members but less than 500,000 members voted as a result of our boycotting the election. We have over 2 million members in Lagos state and that is why the national body cannot close its eyes to us,\u201d he added.\n\nTwo factions of the party in Osun State led by Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, also battled each other in the state.\n\nThe exercise was marred by the crisis in Ede North LGA as armed political hoodlums reportedly attacked members of the party who were holding their congress in the area.\n\nThe thugs, according to eyewitnesses, stormed Film House, NITEL area, beside Pere Police Station, Ede, with guns, cutlasses, and other weapons with which they attacked members of the APC.\n\nA former Chairman of Ede North Local Council Development Area, Mukaila Uthman, confirmed the attack, saying that he was a witness.\n\nOfficers of the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Services (DSS), and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) witnessed the congress which was held at Oduduwa College Ile-Ife in Ife Central LGA.\n\nThe majority of the APC members that participated in the exercise were members of The Osun Progressives (TOP), loyal to Aregbesola\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, however, stated that the crisis rocking the state chapter of APC is an internal affair that will soon be settled amicably.\n\nIn Kwara State, the APC faction, which is loyal to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq adopted consensus for its local government congresses of the party.\n\nThe faction loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed was not part of the arrangement.\n\nIn Bayelsa State, a faction of the party held congresses despite a court order that restrained the party from holding congresses in the state.\n\nWhile the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, was reportedly absent due to official commitment out the country, the Vice Chairman, South-south Zone of the APC Caretaker/Extra ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Chief David Lyon, was seen at party secretariat in Yenagoa at the end of the exercise.\n\nHowever, Sunday Frank-Oputu, a chieftain of the APC and member of the faction led by Hon. Ebierien Fala, faulted the conduct of the congress, describing it as a violation of a subsisting court order before the State High Court and Court of Appeal, sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nFrank-Oputu called on the party leadership to sanction Sylva and the caretaker State Secretary of the party, Alabo Martins over conduct of the congresses against subsisting court order.\n\nIn Abia State, two factions loyal to the state Chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa, and Chief Ikechi Emenike, held parallel congresses but the Local Government Congress Committee led by Hon. Israel Goli only supervised the congress conducted by the faction loyal to Emenike.\n\nTHISDAY",

Yet the administration says it does not have an estimate on the number of such permanent residents who are in Afghanistan and desperately trying to escape Taliban rule.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that nobody is looking for them,\u201d said Howard Shen, spokesman for the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area that is in contact with one such family who says they cannot get out.\n\n\u201cThey are thousands of miles away under an oppressive regime and we\u2019re leaving them behind,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nStung by the U.S. military\u2019s chaotic and deadly retreat, President Biden has promised that evacuation efforts will continue for the 100 to 200 American citizens who want to leave, most of whom he said are dual citizens. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that extends to green card holders and Afghans who supported the U.S. government during the 20-year war.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how that will work without an active U.S. military presence in the country and the Taliban-controlled Kabul airport, a major way out of the country, now closed. But an undersecretary of state said this past week that all American citizens and permanent residents who could not get evacuation flights or were otherwise stranded had been contacted and told to expect further details about routes out once those have been arranged.",

          "text": "Taliban and opposition forces battled on Saturday to control the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, the last Afghan province holding out against the militant group, as the top U.S. general warned of a \u201ccivil war\u201d if the Islamists failed to consolidate power.\n\nBoth sides claimed to have the upper hand in Panjshir but neither could produce conclusive evidence to prove it. The Taliban, which swept through the country ahead of the final withdrawal of U.S.-led forces this week, were unable to control the valley when they ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said the districts of Khinj and Unabah had been taken, giving Taliban forces control of four of the province\u2019s seven districts. \u201cThe Mujahideen (Taliban fighters) are advancing toward the centre (of the province),\u201d he said on Twitter. But the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, grouping forces loyal to local leader Ahmad Massoud, said it surrounded \u201cthousands of terrorists\u201d in Khawak pass and the Taliban had abandoned vehicles and equipment in the Dashte Rewak area. Front spokesman Fahim Dashti added \u201cheavy clashes\u201d were going on.\n\nBoth sides claimed to have the upper hand in Panjshir but neither could produce conclusive evidence to prove it.
