          "text": "\u2022 Court jails two fraudsters in Edo\n\nA Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, on Thursday, sentenced a 34-year-old man, Yakubu Afolayan, to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for impersonation and job scam.\n\nJustice Mahmood Abdulgafar convicted Afolayan on the four counts preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\nThe convict, who hailed from Share, in the Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, was arraigned on March 14, 2019.\n\nHe paraded himself as a custom officer and fraudulently swindled several unsuspecting job seekers under the guise of helping them to secure employment into the Nigeria Customs Service, before the long arm of the law caught up with him.\n\nThe prosecution told the court that Afolayan, between November 2018 and January 2019 in Ilorin fraudulently obtained the sum of N267,000 only from one Usman Opeyemi.\n\nThe offence, according to the prosecution, is contrary to Section 1 (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006 and punishable under Section 1 (3) of the same law.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the counts.\n\nDuring the trial, which lasted for over two years, the prosecution called four witnesses.\n\nDocuments tendered by the prosecution were admitted in evidence by the court.\n\nIn his judgment delivered on Thursday, Justice Abdulgafar said from the totality of evidence before the court, the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and linked the accused to the crime.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was the evidence of PW1 that the Nigeria Customs Service does not sell its recruitment forms to job applicants, but the defendant was collecting various sums of money from his victims as application fees. All the evidence was not challenged or controverted by the defendant.\n\n\u201cAnother aspect to be considered in this case is the statements made by the defendant while he was in the custody of the EFCC. The statements were made voluntarily and he (Afolayan) confessed to the crime.\u201d\n\nIn his allocutus, Afolayan\u2019s counsel, S. O. Ishola, urged the court to temper justice with mercy saying \u201cthe convict is a first time offender\u201d.\n\nIn response, counsel for the EFCC, Andrew Akoja, drew the attention of the court to Section 1(a) and 1(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006, which prescribed a maximum sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment for the offence committed, as well as Section 386 of the Penal Code Law, which prescribed a maximum sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nJustice Abdulgafar said there was nothing the court could do than to follow the provisions of the law in sentencing the convict.\n\n\u201cI hereby sentence you, Yakubu Azeez Afolayan to seven years\u2019 imprisonment on count one; seven years\u2019 imprisonment on count two; three years\u2019 imprisonment on count three and three years\u2019 imprisonment on count four, to run concurrently.\n\n\u201cThe convict is to spend his custodial sentence at the Mandala Correctional Centre with effect from November 14, 2021,\u201d Abdulgafar added.\n\nIn a related development, two fraudsters, Noah Omoregbe (a.k.a Frank Mark) and Destiny Efewengbe (a.k.a William Scot) have been sentenced to two years and six months\u2019 imprisonment respectively, by Justice Efe Ikponmwonba of the Edo State High Court sitting in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nThe convicts were arraigned on one count each of impersonation and intent to defraud, contrary to Section 484 of the Criminal Code Law Cap. 48 Laws of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria (as applicable in Edo State) 1976 and punishable under the same law.\n\nThe charge against Omoregbe read, \u201cThat you, Noah Omoregbe (a.k.a Frank Mark), on or about the 21st day of June 2021 on Yoruba Street, Benin City, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, did with intent to defraud, falsely represented yourself as one Frank Mark, an American soldier, and sent scam messages to one Liud Mila via your iPhone X with IMEI No: 354862090120911 with the intent to obtain money from her, thereby committing an offence contrary to Section 484 of the Criminal Code Law Cap. 48 Laws of defunct Bendel State of Nigeria (as applicable in Edo State) 1976 and punishable under the same law.\u201d\n\nThe defendants pleaded guilty to the charges.\n\nJustice Ikponmwonba convicted and sentenced Omoregbe to two years\u2019 imprisonment with an option of fine of N200,000 , while Efewengbe was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment with an option of N200,000 fine.\n\nHe also ordered that items recovered by the prosecution during investigation be forfeited to the Federal Government. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We are the real Nigerians. We are everywhere and we invest and spend money everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe rest of Nigeria seems to be withdrawn. They should copy the outlook of the Igbo man.\n\n\u201cFor the Igbo man to come and do a 5 storey building in Kaura Namoda and establish a hospital, build other things to add value means that he has faith that he belongs there.\n\n\u201cAnd he is not likely going to encourage anything that will not protect his investments.\n\n\u201cOther Nigerians are still withdrawn and unable to trust one another.

And I now ask; dot, dot everywhere, who own Nigeria? It must be the dot people. The Igbo man adds value and supports socio-economic development.\n\n\u201cSo, there has been this failure to recognize by the authorities that there are a people talking through their attitudes that they are the real Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu further urged Nigerians to rather \u2018walk their talk\u2019 than only declaring that they are Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is not by declaring I\u2019m a Nigerian, you must be able to walk the talk.\n\n\u201cWho are the people that demonstrated faith in Nigeria? It is undeniably the Igbo man. It is not about population, strategic location or living a foot to the river. It is about those who are prepared to recover Sambisa forest for the reason that they want to do business in Sambisa. The Igbo man wants to live in Sambisa and do business.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo man doesn\u2019t just see Sambisa as a forest, but as an investment opportunity. And this is the outlook Nigeria needs.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has threatened to seal shops and business areas, whose premises are littered with wastes.\n\nThe governor, who on Thursday spoke during an unscheduled inspection of four ongoing flyover projects in Port Harcourt and Obio-Akpor local governments, said he took the decision following the carefree attitude of the public towards sanitation.\n\nHe said the state would be cleaner if owners of business premises did not litter them with refuse.Wike said his administration had the political will to implement the directive because it would result in a change of behaviour and increase attention on sanitation\n\n.He said: \u201cThose at Aba road axis of the Rumuola area will be the first victims. Thereafter, others will follow, so that people will know that government is very serious.\n\n\u201dThose who litter their areas with refuse will have themselves to blame. This is not the time people will tell you that the economy is bad.

          "title": "Much ado about electronic transmission of election results",
          "text": "By Jide Oluwajuyitan\n\nAmidst many serious national challenges, Nigerians have once again allowed themselves to be distracted by the National Assembly\u2019s unprofitable controversy over the mode of transmission of result by INEC on election day. Many saw the defeat of the bill as a national tragedy while some others have said it was an assault on democracy. It is perhaps lost on many Nigerians that except the press, neither the current military baked new breed politicians nor their forbears that took power from the colonial masters at independence saw democracy more than the shortest route to power. That was why they wrecked the first republic barely five years after independence over sharing of perks of office, undermined the democcratisation process in the second republic by awarding themselves what Walter Ofonagoro described as \u2018landslide and sea-slide victories in opposition strongholds, while Babagana Kingibe and Tom Ikimi, of SDP and NRC, traded democracy for ambassadorial positions during the still-born third republic.\n\nBeyond stealing the country blind in the first 15 years of the fourth republic, the political elite did very little to enhance the course of democracy. Their children even forged documents to siphon about N1.7trillion in the name of fuel subsidy when in the words of Audu Ogbeh, they never imported a pint of fuel.\n\nLittle has changed under President Buhari government of change. Democracy can hardly thrive in the absence of public opinion. But President Buhari who thinks he knows what the people want without listening to them listen only to himself. He would rather deploy taxpayers\u2019 money to build RUGA settlement for those described by World Terrorist Index as the fourth most deadly terrorist groups in the world rather than mete out the Ghana treatment to those terrorizing Nigerians as demanded by the people.\n\nOur institutions of democracy \u2013 independent judiciary, independent legislature, strong political parties, independent press and virile civil society groups, without which democracy cannot thrive have always been weak. Unfortunately, they have come under more serious assault in the fourth republic with Obasanjo whimsically sacking party leaders, senate presidents and impeaching state governors without following due process. Under Buhari, houses of senior judicial officers were raided at night by DSS officials, lawmakers were once prevented entry into the hallowed chambers by hooded DSS men while his minister of information continues to make attempts at muscling the fourth estate of the realm that in the battle for democracy, forced out the colonial masters just as it disgraced \u2018Nigerian army of anything is possible\u2019 out of power and out of our lives.\n\nOur politicians have always undermined the democratization process by exploiting our diversity. To remain part of Nigeria during the 1953 attempt at resolving our national question, the north insisted on controlling 50% of the membership of the legislature. Yet the Northern People\u2019s Congress in spite of coercion and strong hand tactics of northern leaders came a distant third in the 1959 federal election with about 1.9m trailing, NCNC supported in the main by the Igbos and Yoruba with 2.1 million votes, closely followed by Action Group, the Yoruba dominant political party with 2million votes.\n\nThe battle cry ever since by the north has always been \u2018democracy is a game of numbers\u2019. This was used to justify the inconclusive 1964 elections leading to a constitutional confrontation between President Nnamdi Azikiwe and Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa which snowballed to the January and July 1966 coup and counter coup. It was similarly used to justify the 1979 inconclusive election eventually validated by the courts using Richard Akinjide\u2019s twelve-two-third formula. In 1999, it was used to justify imposition of Obasanjo as president without a political base thereby literarily climbing the palm tree from the top. The story was not different during the 2003 and 2007 massively rigged elections. With Buhari\u2019s landslide victories in 2015 and 2019, northern Fulani irredentist including Governor Nasir El-Rufai who downplayed the contribution of the Yoruba and later boasted about the north population was to remind us of the North\u2019s invincibility during elections.\n\nIt was therefore not a surprise that following the Asaba southern governors\u2019 call for a shift of power to the south in 2023, a shadowy group that describes itself as \u2018Northern Nigerian Consensus Movement\u2019 claiming to represent 75 economic organisations, including Arewa Traders Association, Amalgamated Cattle Association of Nigeria, claim to be ready to be mobilized for the battle.\n\nIf we see the claim as outlandish, we might also remind ourselves that everything about Nigerian population since 1953 as stated above has always been weird. Our population distribution which defies demographic logic that associate higher rate of procreation to the tropical swamp as against semi-desert Sahel region is in itself bizarre. This is why besides our political elite\u2019s conspiracy, the major threat to our democracy since independence remains the northern political elites\u2019 outright rejection of any form of interrogation of this weird claim.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNigerians have always suspected the answer to our strange demographic population spread probably lies in movement of stateless Fulani across our open borders especially in the north during census head count and elections. Baraje, a former PDP chairman and an APC stalwart until recently, not too long ago seemed to have given credence to this clam when he told Nigerians that APC imported foreign herdsmen into Nigeria for the purpose of the 2015 election.\n\nNorthern political elite including Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna and Masari, his Katsina counterpart who admitted negotiating and paying ransom to immigrants Fulani herdsmen terrorising their people do not seem to have anything against the presence of such Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria. Their heartache seems to be over the Fulani immigrants\u2019 failure to stop tormenting Nigerians after collecting ransom. When another northern leading political light, Governor Mohammed of Bauchi State was recently asked by a reporter on Channels Television\u2019s Morning Ride programme whether he considered it right to channel Nigerian taxpayers\u2019 money towards establishing RUGA settlements for immigrant herdsmen, he said without any restraint that Fulani from any part of Africa are Nigerians.\n\nThis type of mindset and northern leaders feeling of invincibility anchored on questionable numerical strength, if you ask me, poses a greater threat to our budding democracy than manual or electronically transfer of election results. After all, a critical analysis of our election outcomes especially at the local council levels since the beginning of the fourth republic will show that there is honour among thieves. Our political leaders hardly lose elections in their strongholds.\n\nIntra-elite feud only set in when there are aberrations such as Ofonagoro\u2019s \u2018landslide and sea-slide victories\u2019 in opposition strong holds as NPN did in Ondo in 1983 which contributed to the collapse of the second republic; Obasanjo\u2019s deployment of military tactics to out-fox the Yoruba Afenifere leaders and their AD party during the 2003 gubernatorial battle in southwest and PDP\u2019s theft of other candidates mandates in Edo, Ondo, Ekiti and Osun in 2007.",

          "text": "*Govt\u2019s tax take among world\u2019s lowest, undermined by widespread evasion, large informal sector\n\nDike Onwuamaeze\n\nA report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), London, has predicted that the federal government might effect a 100 per cent rate increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) from the current rate of 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent before 2025 in order to raise government\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe report titled, \u201cCountry Report Nigeria,\u201d stated that the anticipated increase in VAT was inevitable given the rising public debt burden and the likelihood that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) might not be able to deliver considerable increase in government\u2019s revenue.\n\nIt also stated that the predicted VAT increase would be implemented instalmentally in 2022, 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe report from the research arm of The Economist magazine explained: \u201cWe expect three equal VAT rate increases, taking the rate to 15 per cent by 2025. The first is expected in 2022, prior to the next elections but seemingly inevitable given a rising debt burden, with further rises in 2024 and 2025. Even then we expect fiscal revenue to peak at just five per cent of the GDP in 2024, which also assumes no fuel subsidies beyond 2022.\n\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s tax take is among the world\u2019s lowest, undermined by widespread evasion and a large informal sector. The PIB is likely to be balanced between the interests of the treasury and investors, and so not deliver a considerable increase in revenue.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the VAT, currently at 7.5 per cent, is likely to be used as a means of repairing the public finances.\u201d\n\nThe report also projected that public finances would remain in deficit between 2021 and 2025, because an average global crude oil price of $63.8/barrel in 2021-25, which makes up for more than 50 per cent of the federal government\u2019s retained income, would be insufficient to balance the budget.\n\nIt added that the percentage of public debt to the GDP would stand at 35.4 per cent of the GDP in 2025.\n\n\u201cOverall, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 (from 3.7 per cent of the GDP in 2020) as international oil prices rise.\n\n\u201cAlso, the VAT rate increases and rising oil prices will push down the deficit to 2.6 per cent of the GDP in 2023-24, but a decline in average global oil prices in 2025 will cause the shortfall to widen to 3.0 per cent of the GDP in that year.\n\n\u201cThe government has raised its public debt limit to 40 per cent of GDP to incorporate higher budget shortfalls over the medium term and to accommodate securitisation of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s deficit-financing as long-term debt. We expect public debt to reach only 35.4 per cent of the GDP in 2025,\u201d the report added.\n\nIt further projected that, \u201chigh debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill, and the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines will elevate expenditure. Capital investment will be emphasised to compensate for the disappearance of petrol subsidies once the PIB is enacted (which is expected in late 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government will justify price deregulation by promising to invest the savings in infrastructure and will face pressure to match rhetoric with action.\u201d\n\nThe report also identified price controls on petrol prices and electricity tariffs as another important area of focus, stressing that in spite of the astonishing is lacking.\u201d\n\nIt, however, hinged the hope of market-determined petrol pump price on the Dangote Refinery, a new 650,000-barrel/day refinery near Lagos expected to come on-stream in 2022.\n\nIt, therefore, opined that Nigeria\u2019s economic policy choices would be skewed, \u201ctowards protectionism and, for reasons of incompatibility will lean away from internationalism,\u201d even though the country would remain a major player in Africa, given its size.\n\nIt added: \u201cLand borders that were closed to goods since late 2019 have reopened, but Nigeria\u2019s approach to encouraging regional trade will be minimalist, beyond its obligations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTFA).\n\n\u201cThe trade pact compels Nigeria to eliminate 97 per cent of tariff lines over the next five to 10 years. This deadline will not be met zealously, given high prices in Nigeria and declining external competitiveness for industries that could otherwise benefit from regional market access.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Corporation pays N225.5bn into joint account\n\n*Deficit may hit N820.6bn by year end\n\n*Brent rises to $71pb\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe statutory payments made by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to the Federation Account, a joint pool operated by the local, state and federal governments, declined by over 63 per cent in the first five months of 2021, documents obtained by THISDAY have indicated.\n\nAn analysis of the data presented by the national oil company to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), in the first five months of this year showed that of the calendarised total sum of N613.834 billion, the corporation was only able to remit N225.852 billion.\n\nThe documents obtained from one of the federal ministries showed that N387.982 billion remained unpaid during the period under consideration, representing about 63.21 per cent actual budgetary forecast.\n\nAccording to the NNPC/ FAAC data, while the corporation was expected to pay a net amount of N122.767 billion monthly into the federation account, it was only able to remit N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nBut as it earlier announced, the national oil company was unable to make any payment into the federation account in April, while a paltry N29.647 billion was remitted in May.\n\nAs exclusively reported by THISDAY earlier in the month, the corporation said it would deduct N114.337 billion from the June federation proceeds at a meeting, which took place last week.\n\nThe documents showed that N225.852 billion was remitted as of May, while a projected N820.684 billion shortage of the net total forecast of N1.473 trillion for 2021 might be recorded by the end of the year if the current challenges continue.\n\nWhile there might be other ancillary issues leading to the inability of the corporation to meet its obligation to the three tiers of government, the NNPC has had to deal with the major challenge of shouldering the government\u2019s petrol subsidy payments in the last couple of months.\n\nThe elimination of payments for what the government now terms under-recovery has been a controversial issue for decades as attempts to alter the existing arrangement has always met with stiff resistance from the labour unions, civil society organisations as well as a cross-section of Nigerians.\n\nLast year, specifically on March 19, at a time the international prices of crude oil took a downward spiral, the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration had announced the total deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector.\n\nHowever, there has been a rollback of that policy following the gradual recovery of the price of the commodity in the international market, which has invariably affected the pump price of fuel in the country.\n\nIn all, added to the funding of its ongoing major projects, payment for under-recovery, among others, the funding performance of the corporation showed that as of May, N1.088 trillion had been disbursed by the NNPC, including N195.652 billion in January and N191.194 billion in February.\n\nIn March, also, N224.589 billion was distributed, while in April and May, N156.366 billion and N320 billion were disbursed respectively.\n\nThe Group General Manager, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, in March, said the federal government was subsidising petrol with about N120 billion monthly, describing the development as unsustainable.\n\nHe said while the actual cost of importation and handling charges amounted to N234 per litre, the government had been selling at N162 per litre, therefore, bearing the cost burden.\n\nHe said the NNPC could no longer afford to bear the cost, saying Nigerians would have to pay the actual cost sooner or later. But the government has since then said it was in negotiations with organised labour on the matter.\n\nOn June 30, the NNPC boss revealed that the price of the product had further skyrocketed and that without subsidy, petrol would be selling at N256 per litre at the filling stations.\n\nAt the time Kyari spoke, crude oil was selling for $74.40 per barrel at the international market. It has since then hit a high of $77, before slumping below $70 on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, yesterday, the Brent crude sustained its upswing rising from $69.05 per barrel to close at $71.02 per barrel.\n\nThe price rally was in reaction to an industry report which showed an unexpected build-up in US oil inventories last week, which heightened worries about a resurgence in COVID-19 infections potentially dampening fuel demand.\n\nEarlier, a deal by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC,) and its allies, known as OPEC+ to boost supply by 400,000 bpd each month from August through December, sparked an oil price slump on Monday, exacerbated by demand fears with cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus picking up in major markets.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year.

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down.

Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGoogle x Maliyo Games partnership\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\nClubhouse killing invite-only feature\n\nGoogle x Maliyo partners to train 500 game developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has partnered with Nigeria-based gaming studio, Maliyo to organise the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp to give Africans an opportunity to be a part of the booming gaming industry.\n\nThe programme would involve training mobile game developers. Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Google\u2019s interest in Africa\u2019s tech talent pool deepens, the tech giant has partnered with Nigerian-founded game development studio, Maliyo Games, to open applications for a mobile game developer training program. Called GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, the program is available to interested individuals in Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\nThe applications, which opened on Monday, July 19, 2021 \u2014 and closes by August 2 \u2014 will offer developers planning to build a career in game development access to mentorship and relevant tools. Selected applicants will go through a virtual training program from August 16 to December 23, 2021, where they will learn to refine, package, and develop Android games.\n\nBeing a project-based learning program, by the end of the training period, successful participants will be evaluated based on the completion of the curriculum and ability to publish a game on the Google Play Store successfully.\n\nParticipants will pass through three levels of training, themed: Game Development Fundamentals, Succeed on the Play Store, and Publish Your First Game. The successful completion of one level validates moving to the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEligibility\n\nIntending applicants must:\n\nReside in Nigeria, Ghana, or Kenya\n\nHave a basic background in programming languages like C#, C++, and PHP.\n\nOwn a PC.\n\nBe available to commence Bootcamp by August 16, 2021\n\nNote: Selected participants will be judged based on three metrics: competence, commitment, and creativity.\n\nApplication process\n\nApplicants will pass through two stages before final shortlisting.\n\nStage one: Fill the online application form on the company website.\n\nStage two: After scaling the first stage, shortlisted candidates will have to undergo a C# (a core language for game developers) assessment to demonstrate their competence in the programming language. The assessment is scheduled to hold on August 9, 2021.\n\nNote: The organisers will provide data allowance for selected developers during the training.\n\nAbout GameUpAfrica Bootcamp\n\nThe GameUpAfrica Bootcamp is an adaptation of an existing training project by Maliyo Games, which was instituted in 2020. It is a curriculum-based training program that prospective hires must go through before they are accepted into the company.\n\nBetween 2020 and now, the company has trained seven people and absorbed one into the company. Interestingly, the program was born out of the need to solve the problem of talent acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually launched this program because, as a game development studio, we are constantly looking for talented individuals to join our team. And because of a lack of structured education system that produces competent game developers in Nigeria, we made the decision last year to launch an in-house program that will enable us to train individuals who are interested in becoming game developers.\u201d That\u2019s Hugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games. Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2012, the company has grown to become one of Nigeria\u2019s longest-standing Android game development studios. According to the founder, this is one of the qualities that attracted Google to the project, aside from the fact that Maliyo Games has published some Africa-themed games on the Google Play Store.\n\nNotable mentions include Aboki Run (similar to Temple Run), Whot King, and Jungle escape. Others like Danfo Racer are still in development.\n\nEven though the company\u2019s initial intention for the curriculum is limited to the Nigerian market, Google\u2019s partnership increased the scope to reach multiple locations, thereby raising the number of selected applicants to 500. In addition to that, Google will also provide support for app store success, which includes successful publishing of content on Google Play Store.\n\nAnother way this program will help beginner game developers is by providing them with a pool of mentors. Going by the number of admitted candidates, mentorship will not only come from Maliyo Games team, but the company will also crowdsource mentors from the international gaming ecosystem.\n\nExperienced mentors can volunteer through this link.\n\nMaliyo Games\u2019 fit\n\nAs is typical of content from many indigenous companies, Maliyo Games studio ensures that its content reflects the African scene.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t do the generic stuff, like working for third parties and designing based on their requirements or being part of a production team where we only look after one aspect of e development. For us, it has always been about African-inspired. And this is what stands us out in the gaming community,\u201d the founder explains.\n\nFor Obi, the ultimate goal of the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp \u2014 which could become a yearly affair \u2014 is to upskill people and have more game developers in the African gaming ecosystem. In addition to that, to increase the number of African-published content on the Google Play Store, and help to identify and attract talents into the company as it plans to grow its team.\n\nIn achieving the former, Obi reveals that top candidates from the Bootcamp will be linked with other studios across the continent. Already, there are existing internal partnerships with studios in Kenya, Ghana, and Senegal.\n\nAside from that, Maliyo Games is part of the Africa Game Developer Community, where it networks with gaming studios in South Africa, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. Eventually, Obi believes that the Bootcamp will become a talent pipeline for these studios.\n\nMeanwhile, game studios looking to hire developers through the program can show their interest here.\n\nAfrica\u2019s gaming industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth of the African gaming industry has been gaining momentum for the past three years with growing broadband and smartphone penetration. In fact, prospects are increasing despite the pandemic.\n\nObi likens games to music and movies, not only as a form of escape, but also entertainment which is universally accepted without discrimination of the source.\n\nHe identifies three major challenges that may have stalled the growth of the country\u2019s gaming industry in the past decade: talent, distribution, and monetisation.\n\nIn his opinion, in the past 9 years of running Maliyo Games, opportunities that exist now are thinning out the effects of these challenges. For instance, global distribution channels now exist \u2014 the likes of app stores \u2014 supporting reach and marketing, and payment solutions abound.\n\nWith this, creators can focus on developing and releasing content. If anything, local content are assured of global consumption. Obi\u2019s dream is that by the end of 2022, a product of the Bootcamp would become a highly grossed game on the Google Play Store.\n\nWith projects like this, Africa\u2019s gaming community is, perhaps, on its way to becoming a major contributor to the over $121.1 billion global mobile gaming industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nWhat\u2019s on the menu:\n\nUpdates on Nigeria\u2019s Startup Bill\n\nKenya\u2019s Zoom tax\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s securities law\n\nThe latest on Nigeria\u2019s Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, we brought you news about a Startup Bill for Nigeria. Well, its website is live now. Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, revealed this in a tweet yesterday.\n\nWhat\u2019s the fuss about? Since the 90s, when the first tech companies were founded, Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem has progressed. Since then, we\u2019ve seen Paystack get acquired, Interswitch and Flutterwave become unicorns, and Jumia get listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are supposed to be exciting times, but it appears government policies are making it difficult for entrepreneurs and investors to remain excited. This year alone, the transacting of cryptocurrency through banks has been regulated, while Twitter has been temporarily banned in the country.\n\nEvents like this have made it important for founders to interact with the government, hence, the Startup Bill. At the time of the first report, it was revealed that a first draft of the bill would be ready by August 2021.\n\nWith the website launching only 11 days to the end of July, it could be that plans are on track.\n\nAccording to a Medium post on the website, the first draft of the bill would be reviewed by ecosystem leaders and representatives in July, while town halls would be held in August 2021. A final draft would be produced in September 2021 and submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari in October 2021.\n\nCause for optimism? Should plans for the bill go as planned, it could unlock a lot of value for Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. For one, investors are assured that sudden government policies would not destroy their investments. More capital being injected into the tech ecosystem would also mean more jobs, and who can complain about that?\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ll keep you informed of any new developments.\n\nKenyans to pay VAT for using Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>Photo Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-mbabazi-001a331a/\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d rel=\u201dnoopener\u201d>Morgan Mbabazi</a> (National Media Group).</em>\n\nStarting August 2021, Kenyans will begin paying Value Added Tax (VAT) for using video conferencing platform, Zoom. The company joins the ranks of YouTube and Facebook as Internet platforms charging VAT in the country.\n\nWho is this for? Not everyone. Customers will be issued a VAT invoice showing the tax at the appropriate rate if they are not registered for VAT in Kenya. For registered VAT customers, they must provide Zoom with their Personal Identification Number (PIN) and a declaration that they are registered for VAT in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a customer\u2019s \u2018sold to\u2019 location indicates Kenya, but they have not provided a valid PIN and the required declaration, Zoom will charge Kenyan VAT on the invoice.\n\nThis development is not surprising. To increase revenue, the Kenyan government has revealed plans to tax companies that generate profit from the country.\n\nChanging times. Across the world, attempts by governments to tax digital businesses have increased. However, it is not straightforward as they operate models that are not catered to by most taxation laws.\n\nAs we revealed in a previous article, the existing agreement under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stipulates that companies pay taxes where their goods/services are produced instead of where they are consumed.\n\nThat has not stopped governments from trying, and the Kenyan government has led the way on the African continent. These are still early days, but it seems companies are getting on board quickly, and it might be a matter of time before other African countries follow suit.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nZimbabwe to include VASPs as securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@ewankennedy19?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Ewan Kennedy</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-trading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has revealed its intention to widen the definition of securities to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n\nVASPs refer to entities that facilitate the transaction, safekeeping, and administration of digital currencies. Consequently, cryptocurrency exchanges in Zimbabwe would now be regulated under the amended Securities and Exchange Act.\n\nThis move, which is the first time digital assets are mentioned under Zimbabwean law, suggests that the government is open to cryptocurrencies as stores of value and could facilitate their adoption in the South African country.\n\nBecause of attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies by governments, a common debate has been that of their status as securities. Classifying them as securities would mean that governments would regulate their usage, something that proponents say goes against the nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBy the way, seeing you love reading our newsletter this much, invite your friends and family to join you.

I think it is Shakespeare that said in Macbeth that there is no art of finding the human construction from the face. In this case, who really is the terrorist? The terrorists fighting on the battlefield are different from the terrorists that are funding them or that are outside.\n\n\u201cWe are moving towards a situation whereby the Pro-Igbohos, the Pro-Kanus, the Pro-Self-determination (people) etc may begin now to make bombs themselves and be throwing here and there and the whole country will be disorderly. We need application of basic thinking,\u201d he said\n\nAkinterinwa, according to PUNCH, stressed that the clampdown on agitators was not the solution but a mediation process where all parties would sit at a table and dialogue.\n\n\u201cArrest all of them, extradite all of them but that won\u2019t stop the agitation for Yoruba Republic and it won\u2019t stop agitation for Biafra Republic. Biafra Republic came into being as far back as 1962; it was discussed in their palace. So, if by 1967, the war broke out\u2026it is simply because the people felt they do not want to belong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf any President of Nigeria is sincere about wanting to govern Nigeria (with due respect to all others), please sit down, strategise, ask people to come: \u2018What really are your grievances? Okay, if you want to be sovereign, in which way will the interest of all others? We are all brothers and sisters.'\u201d\n\nKanu was extradited from Kenya and Igbo who was arrested in Benin Republic at weekend on the request of Nigerian government, is facing possible extradition to the country.",

          "title": "Zamfara, Kebbi, Niger worst hit as gunmen kill 1,031 abduct 390 in one month \u2013 Report",
          "text": "A total of 1,031 persons were reported killed, while 390 others were abducted in 205 incidents recorded in 34 states across Nigeria in June 2021, according a report by Beacon Consulting, a security risk management and intelligence company.\n\nAccording to report, Zamfara, Kebbi, and Niger were worst hit as a total of 275 persons were killed in Zamfara State, 93 in Kebbi State, and 91 in Niger State during the month under review.\n\nThe report titled: \u201cNigeria Security Report\u201d obtained recorded various cases of insecurity in June; from armed attacks, armed clashes, mob violence, social disruptions, to other violent crimes.\n\nIn 127 Local Government Areas across the 34 states of the federation under review with the exception of Bauchi and Gombe states, various incidents of casualties and kidnappings were reported with the majority of the cases recorded in areas bedeviled by \u2018rural banditry.\u2019\n\nThe report said nine persons were killed and 20 others abducted in four attacks recorded in the month by Boko Haram and other terror-related groups.\n\nAlso, 18 persons were killed in 12 attacks attributed to the Eastern Security Network and the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) in the same period.\n\nA breakdown of the incidents by regions shows that the Northwest recorded the highest occurrence of insecurity casualties with 416 killings and 280 abductions in 28 Local Government Areas, followed by 218 fatalities and 24 abductions in 27 Local Government Areas in the North-central.\n\nA total of 188 fatalities and 22 abductions were reported in the Northeast within the period under review, while in the Southeast, 117 cases of killings and 26 abductions were reported, in 20 Local Government Areas of Enugu, Anambra, Abia and Ebonyi states in incidents of armed attacks, armed clashes, social disruptions, violent crimes and airstrikes/bomb attacks.\n\nThe Southwest also had 74 fatalities and 27 abductions from 30 Local Government Areas of Oyo, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo, Ogun, and Lagos state, with the South-south recording the lowest amongst the southern regions with 18 fatalities and 11 abductions in 15 Local Government Areas of Edo, Rivers, Delta, Cross River, and Akwa Ibom states.\n\nA total of 275 persons were killed in various attacks in Zamfara State, Northwest, where activities of terror groups have pauperised most rural dwellers; there were no abductions recorded. But in neighbouring Kebbi State, 119 abductions were recorded with 93 fatalities.\n\nKaduna State recorded 26 deaths with 157 abductions, while Katsina State recorded six deaths with three abductions. Sokoto State had 15 fatalities with zero abduction, Kano and Jigawa states recorded one death each with no abductions.\n\nNiger State in the North-central, according to the breakdown, had the highest incidents of 91 deaths and three abductions, while Benue and Plateau states had only one recorded case of kidnap with 72 and 27 fatalities respectively.\n\nKwara State recorded 11 deaths with no abduction, while Kogi and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) recorded three deaths and 10 abductions respectively.\n\nAccording to the report, the activities of non-state actors popularly referred to as \u2018bandits\u2019 continued unabated in the Northwest and North-central despite ongoing security forces operations.\n\n\u201cIn the reporting period, the violent attacks on mainly rural communities were sustained in Kaduna, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto, and Zamfara states and mass abduction of students in schools in Kebbi, Kaduna, and Niger states, as well as families of staff, workers and patients at a medical institution in Kaduna State,\u201d the report read.\n\n\u201cWe also monitored the setting up of illegal checkpoints, where these non-state actors abducted commuters and in one incident along the Kaduna \u2013 Kachia road, killed some of their victims for unknown reasons. We monitored increasing indications of the convergence between armed groups in the northeast and the ones in the North Central and North West.\u201d\n\nIn the Northeast, a total of 101 fatalities were recorded in eight Local Government Areas of Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, and Taraba states. Some of the incidences mentioned in the report in the region were Boko Haram attack on a community and killing of police officers as well as the burning of UN facilities in Yobe State; the killing of over 50 ISWAP terrorists in Borno and the killing of six ISWAP terrorists in Dikwa, Borno State.\n\nAlso highlighted in the report was the storming of Gadawaluwol village in Adamawa State where one person was killed, as well as the killing by suspected criminal herders of a father and two sons in Galang Jauro village in Taraba State.\n\nThe report, obtained by Daily Trust, warned that criminals and criminal activities, including kidnapping for ransom, violent and petty crimes, as well as home invasions, are likely to continue in the short and medium terms due to the progressive worsening of the economic circumstances in the country and rising inflation.\n\n\u201cThere will be a continuation of non-state actors\u2019 activities challenging the supremacy of the state\u2019s monopoly of force and sustenance of their attacks on communities including kidnapping for ransom and raids. This, in turn, will push communities to evolve self-help initiatives including protests, where they block access routes and arm themselves,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cThe deteriorating security situation will continue to fuel political rancor and the exchange between the ruling party and its members and between it and opposition parties, social upheaval especially protests by Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and political groups hiding behind civil activists will emerge as a major driver of security challenges as the effect of the economic downturn forces governments at the federal and state levels to take measures to manage these impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Northeast, the non-state actors waging a terror war and the ongoing military operation Hadin Kai will continue the armed conflict. The restructuring and consolidation of ISWAP will translate into bolder attacks and other activities of the group. This will mean a continuation of armed attacks and counter attacks as well as illegal checkpoints mounted along major travel routes particularly in Borno state but in the border towns of Yobe and Adamawa states.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), the umbrella union of all editors in Nigeria, has has kicked against what it called \u201cdraconian\u201d attempts to gag the media, noting that the media industry is not a political opponent or enemy of the Federal Government.\n\nThe guild said many of the political elite\u2019s attacks on the media were not envisioned to win an argument on values, journalistic or legal, but meant to bully media organisations.\n\nThe NGE said this while reacting to what it called \u201cdraconian provisions\u201d in two Bills to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act that are currently before the National Assembly.\n\nThe guild said the sponsors of the Bills claimed that they were aimed at moderating the \u201crecklessness\u201d of the media, but it argued that they \u201care actually meant to criminalise journalism practice in the country\u201d.\n\nIn a statement by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary), the NGE said the media, being the \u201coxygen of democracy,\u201d would be strangulated if the Bills were passed in their present forms.\n\n\u201cAt a time there is a popular ongoing global conversation about the need for a #NewDealForJournalism\u201d \u2013 for immediate and sustained action from, and collaboration between governments and other influential actors to improve the policy, funding, and enabling environment for independent professional journalism \u2013 we see the proposed legislations as unhelpful.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not opposed to an Act that will promote media stakeholders-driven regulatory council, the many draconian provisions in the Odebunmi Olusegun-sponsored Bills are actually aimed at criminalising media practice in Nigeria. While the intention of the sponsor of the bills is suspicious, the Bills negate all known features of media regulatory bodies in the world,\u201d the NGE said.\n\nThe guild alluded to the NPC Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992, created by the military dictatorship.\n\nIt noted that while the NPC Act \u201cgives the Council\u2019s Board full responsibility to administer the council\u201d, the proposed Act restricts the council\u2019s board to \u201cadvisory capacity on a part-time basis without direct interference in the day-to-day administration of the council\u201d, and gives the Executive Secretary all the power.\n\n\u201cWhile the proposed NPC Act says the Board shall consist of one representative each from the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON), the Ministry of Information, two representative of the general public, one of whom shall be a legal practitioner and a woman and Executive Secretary of the council, who shall serve as the secretary to the Board, the board is a mere advisory body.\n\n\u201cThe Bill also says that the Chairman of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of Information, and that all other members of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation by the Minister of Information. The intension of this kind of Council is suspicious,\u201d the NGE said.\n\nThe body of editors stressed that the professional body does not need the approval of the Minister of Information to establish and disseminate a National Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of the print media, related media houses and media practitioners.\n\nThe body approved the placement of penalties and fines against violation of the press code, as provided for in the Bill.\n\nOn the proposed NBC amendment legislation, the guild said the Section 23 of the Bill, which gives the Minister of Information the powers to participate in the making of regulations, is unhelpful.\n\nIt added that the participation of the minister would turn NBC into a tool for political interference.\n\nThe guild also said the provisions of the two bills give the impression that the Federal Government is out to crush its enemy, saying that the media is not an enemy of the state.\n\nThe NGE added that the two Bills, if passed, would compound the nation\u2019s negative image in the global community.\n\nIt stressed that the Bills are perceived to be attempts to further stifle the democratic space in the country, which is currently having challenges in all fronts.\n\nThe NGE said it also opposed to heavy involvement of the President and the Minister of Information in the composition of appointments into the boards of NBC and the NPC, saying the board members should appoint their own chairmen.\n\n\u201cThe NPC and NBC should be truly independent, and should not be under the supervision of the Minister of Information, who is a political office holder and affiliated to a political party,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe Ghana model comes to mind here. Nigeria should be seen to be moving with time, instead of taking retrogressive steps in media freedom.\u201d\n\nThe guild urged the National Assembly to remove the obnoxious provisions in the two Bills, which make them look as if they were meant to strangulate, instead of regulate the media.",

I am particularly not happy with the three per cent that was eventually passed. Most of us disagree completely and that was why I led my other colleagues from the South-South to stage a walkout.\n\n\u201cBy this development, this country is not helping itself and it is also not helping investors.

The argument was that the investors would not come if more than three per cent was approved.\n\n\u201cHowever, I want to state that if the host communities are not happy, the investors will not come.

It appears we have been left on our own. No one is showing any interest in getting our children released from the den of the bandits,\u201d one of the parents was quoted as saying.\n\nHowever, the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Ahmed Matane, debunked the claim, saying: \u201cThere was never a time that government promised to pay ransom to bandits or assist the parents to pay any or part of the ransom. We have a policy not to pay ransom; we still stand by that policy.\n\n\u201cYou know this issue of payment of ransom is not healthy. The government as a policy does not do it but I know that because they are engaging with the bandits, they can tell them anything.\u201d\n\nAsked if the government was aware that three of the children had died, he said, \u201cI am not aware that three of the girls have died. You know these people (bandits) can be very deceptive. They raise a lot of emotions and sentiments so that we will accept their bidding.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator representing Bayelsa West District in the National Assembly, Seriake Dickson, has described the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB , and the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 by the parliament as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nDickson, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja over the perceived shortcomings in the two bills, however, warned that the approved three percent Host Communities Trust Fund in the PIB may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThis is as he justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC\n\nThe former Bayelsa State governor specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund, will not in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors .\n\nAccording to him, the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which is even lower to the 10% being demanded for by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, supposed to have been retained in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed, given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years , the Armed banditry and Kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East, to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used , which in actual fact do not build a nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria, but presence of justice, fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to nation building,\u201d he added.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill, but send it back for more consultation and required Inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nHe disclosed that he along with other lawmakers from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Muhamnadu Buhari had with the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for host communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers, have their way,\u201d he further argued.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Commitee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process, unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Commitee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.",

Intellectuals and historians should be fair to us so that those who are looking for leadership positions will not exploit the political ignorance or lack of knowledge of the people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told the governors to remain steadfast on delivering their promises to the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have done our best and thank God for what we have been able to achieve with the available resources, otherwise we would have been in trouble,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President said the security situation had improved compared to the instability in the North East before 2015, and the South South, where some parts of the north were directly under the control of terrorists, while the south was facing serious challenges.\n\n\u201cThe subsequent development in the North West is the most amazing, where people who lived together, spoke same language and shared common faith started killing each other and rustling cows.\n\n\u201cI had to change the security chiefs and we had to get down to the fundamentals of providing security. If you look at the situation in relation to time and resources, you will find out what we have been able to achieve, \u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nHe said oil prices fell from more than 100 dollars to less than 38 dollars under his administration, and the output that was 2.1 million barrels a day dropped to about 500,000 barrels, yet a lot was achieved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his remarks, the Governor of Kebbi State and Chairman of Progressive Governors Forum, Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, thanked the President for providing vision and strong leadership for the APC, noting that the efforts to mainstream agriculture as mainstay of the economy was yielding results.\n\n\u201cI drove from Kebbi State to Daura, and stopped to pick the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, and realized that for the eight hours of coming here, we didn\u2019t see more than 10km of land that was not cultivated.\n\n\u201cIt goes to show that the efforts to improve security is also paying off. Farmers are taking advantage and planting. In six weeks, Your Excellency, you have commissioned projects in Lagos, Kano, Katsina and Borno States, and also launched some projects virtually.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the projects the federal government is doing in every state of the country and supporting governors, even those that are not so progressive,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBagudu said three governors, Prof Ben Ayade of Cross River, David Umahi of Ebonyi and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara left their former parties to join the APC because of the fatherliness, equitable character and focus of the President on bottom-up development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have you as our leader. Your achievements and ideals are inculcated in all of us,\u2019\u2019 he noted.\n\nThe governors at the meeting with the President also include Prof Ben Ayade of Cross River, David Umahi of Ebonyi, Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, John Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, who is Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina, Simon Lalong of Plateau and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger, Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun and Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa States were also part of the homage to President Buahri\u2019s country home.",

          "text": "Two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine are nearly as effective against the highly transmissible Delta coronavirus variant as they are against the previously dominant Alpha variant, according to a new study.\n\nResearch published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday showed the vaccines were highly effective against the Delta variant, now the dominant strain worldwide, provided a person had received two shots.\n\nThe study confirms headline findings given by Public Health England (PHE) in May about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca based on real-world data.\n\nWednesday\u2019s study found that Pfizer was 88 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant with both doses, compared with 93.7 percent against the Alpha variant, broadly the same as previously reported.\n\nTwo shots of AstraZeneca vaccine were 67 percent effective against the Delta variant, up from 60 percent originally reported, and 74.5 percent effective against the Alpha variant, compared with an original estimate of 66 percent effectiveness.\n\n\u201cOnly modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the Delta variant as compared with the Alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses,\u201d Public Health England researchers wrote.\n\nData from Israel has estimated that Pfizer\u2019s shot is less effective against symptomatic disease, although protection against severe disease remains high.\n\nPHE had previously said that the first dose of either vaccine was approximately 33 percent effective against symptomatic disease from the Delta variant.\n\nThe full study published on Wednesday found that one dose of Pfizer\u2019s shot was 36 percent effective and one dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was about 30 percent effective.\n\n\u201cOur finding of reduced effectiveness after the first dose would support efforts to maximise vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable groups in the context of circulation of the Delta variant,\u201d the authors of the study said.\n\nIn June, makers of Russia\u2019s Sputnik vaccine also said that it is about 90 percent effective against the highly contagious Delta variant [File: Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters]\n\nRecently, researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the US city of Boston also said that in a laboratory setting, the antibody response from the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine worked well against Delta and that immune response lasted for about eight months.\n\nIn June, makers of Russia\u2019s Sputnik vaccine also said that it was about 90 percent effective against the highly contagious Delta variant.\n\nThe shot, which Russia has actively marketed abroad, was previously found by researchers to be almost 92 percent effective against the original strain of coronavirus.\n\nDenis Logunov, the deputy director of Moscow\u2019s Gamaleya Institute which developed Sputnik, said the Delta variant efficacy figure was calculated based on digital medical and vaccine records, the Russian state-owned RIA news agency reported.\n\nThe Sputnik vaccine, however, has raised some controversy as it was introduced to the public even before a full trial was completed.

          "title": "Death Rates Soar in Southeast Asia as Virus Wave Spreads",
          "text": "Indonesia has converted nearly its entire oxygen production to medical use just to meet the demand from COVID-19 patients struggling to breathe. Overflowing hospitals in Malaysia had to resort to treating patients on the floor. And in Myanmar\u2019s largest city, graveyard workers have been laboring day and night to keep up with the grim demand for new cremations and burials.\n\nImages of bodies burning in open-air pyres during the peak of the pandemic in India horrified the world in May, but in the last two weeks the three Southeast Asian nations have now all surpassed India\u2019s peak per capita death rate as a new coronavirus wave, fueled by the virulent delta variant, tightens its grip on the region.\n\nThe deaths have followed record numbers of new cases being reported in countries across the region which have left health care systems struggling to cope and governments scrambling to implement new restrictions to try to slow the spread.\n\nWhen Eric Lam tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized on June 17 in the Malaysian state of Selangor, the center of the country\u2019s outbreak, the corridors of the government facility were already crowded with patients on beds with no room left in the wards.\n\nThe situation was still better than in some other hospitals in Selangor, Malaysia\u2019s richest and most populous state, where there were no free beds at all and patients were reportedly treated on floors or on stretchers. The government has since added more hospital beds and converted more wards for COVID-19 patients.\n\nLam, 38, recalled once during his three weeks in the hospital hearing a machine beeping continuously for two hours before a nurse came to turn it off; he later learned the patient had died.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to the recent surge in the region, including people growing weary of the pandemic and letting precautions slip, low vaccination rates and the emergence of the delta variant of the virus, which was first detected in India, said Abhishek Rimal, the Asia-Pacific emergency health coordinator for the Red Cross, who is based in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cWith the measures that countries are taking, if people follow the basics of washing the hands, wearing the masks, keeping distance and getting vaccinated, we will be seeing a decline in cases in the next couple of weeks from now,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, however, Malaysia\u2019s national lockdown measures have not brought down the daily rate of infections. The country of some 32 million saw daily cases rise above 10,000 on July 13 for the first time and they have stayed there since.\n\nThe vaccination rate remains low but has been picking up, with nearly 15% of the population now fully inoculated and the government hoping to have a majority vaccinated by year\u2019s end.\n\nDoctors and nurses have been working tirelessly to try to keep up, and Lam was one of the fortunate ones.\n\nAfter his condition initially deteriorated, he was put on a ventilator in an ICU unit filled to capacity and slowly recovered. He was discharged two weeks ago.\n\nBut he lost his father and brother-in-law to the virus, and another brother remains on a ventilator in the ICU.\n\n\u201cI feel I have been reborn and given a second chance to live,\u201d he said.\n\nWith India\u2019s massive population of nearly 1.4 billion people, its total number of COVID-19 fatalities remains higher than the countries in Southeast Asia. But India\u2019s 7-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths per million peaked at 3.04 in May, according to the online scientific publication Our World in Data, and continues to decline.\n\nIndonesia, Myanmar, and Malaysia have been showing sharp increases since late June and their seven-day averages hit 4.37, 4.29 and 4.14 per million, respectively, on Wednesday. Cambodia and Thailand have also seen strong increases in both coronavirus cases and deaths, but have thus far held the seven-day rate per million people to a lower 1.55 and 1.38, respectively.\n\nIndividual countries elsewhere have higher rates, but the increases are particularly alarming for a region that widely kept numbers low early in the pandemic.\n\nWith the Indian experience as a lesson, most countries have reacted relatively quickly with new restrictions to slow the virus, and to try to meet the needs of the burgeoning number of people hospitalized with severe illnesses, Rimal said.\n\n\u201cPeople in this region are cautious, because they have seen it right in front of them \u2014 400,000 cases a day in India \u2014 and they really don\u2019t want it to repeat here,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nBut those measures take time to achieve the desired effect, and right now countries are struggling to cope.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation with some 270 million people, reported 1,383 deaths on Wednesday, its deadliest day since the start of the pandemic.\n\nDaily cases through about mid-June had been about 8,000, but then began to spike and peaked last week with more than 50,000 new infections each day. Because Indonesia\u2019s testing rate is low, the actual number of new cases is thought to be much higher.\n\nAs hospitals there began to run out of oxygen, the government stepped in and ordered manufacturers to shift most production from industrial purposes and dedicate 90% to medical oxygen, up from 25%.\n\nBefore the current crisis, the country needed 400 tons of oxygen for medical use per day; with the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, daily use has increased fivefold to more than 2,000 tons, according to Deputy Health Minister Dante Saksono.\n\nThough the production of oxygen is now sufficient, Lia Partakusuma, secretary general of Indonesia\u2019s Hospital Association, said there were problems with distribution so some hospitals are still facing shortages.\n\nIn Indonesia, about 14% of of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, primarily China\u2019s Sinovac.\n\nThere are growing concerns that Sinovac is less effective against the delta variant, however, and both Indonesia and Thailand are planning booster shots of other vaccines for their Sinovac-immunized health workers.\n\nIn Myanmar, the pandemic had taken backseat to the military\u2019s power seizure in February, which set off a wave of protests and violent political conflict that devastated the public health system.\n\nOnly in recent weeks, as testing and reporting of COVID-19 cases has started recovering, has it become clear that a new wave of the virus beginning in mid-May is pushing cases and deaths rapidly higher.\n\nSince the start of July its death rate has been climbing almost straight up, and both cases and fatalities are widely believed to be seriously underreported.\n\n\u201cWith little testing capacity, low numbers in the country vaccinated, widespread shortages of oxygen and other medical supplies, and an already beleaguered health care system under increasing strain, the situation is expected to get increasingly worse in the coming weeks and months,\u201d said ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, a regional advocacy group.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the junta\u2019s confiscation of oxygen, attacks on health care workers and facilities since the coup, and the lack of trust in any services they provide by the majority of the population, risks turning a crisis into a disaster.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the government reported 5,860 new cases and 286 new deaths. There are no solid figures on vaccinations, but from the number of doses that have been available, it\u2019s thought that about 3% of the population could have received two shots.\n\nOfficials this week pushed back at social media postings that cemeteries in Yangon were overwhelmed and could not keep up with the number of dead, inadvertently confirming claims that hospitals were swamped and many people were dying at home.\n\nCho Tun Aung, head of the department that oversees the cemeteries told military-run Myawaddy TV news on Monday that 350 staff members had been working three shifts since July 8 to ensure proper cremations and burials of people at Yangon\u2019s seven major cemeteries.\n\nHe said workers had cremated and buried more than 1,200 people on Sunday alone, including 1,065 who had died at home of COVID-19 and 169 who had died in hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe are working in three shifts day and night to inter the dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear that there is no problem like the posts on Facebook.\u201d",
