          "text": "A woman from the western German city of Solingen on Thursday received a life sentence of 15 years after being found guilty of murdering five out of her six children. The children were aged between one and eight years.\n\nThe court sitting in the city of Wuppertal found no extenuating circumstances, this virtually rules out the release for the woman, who is 28, after she has served the normal life term of 15 years, the News Agency of Nigeria reports.\n\nThe woman\u2019s eldest son survived her actions.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution alleged that she had first sedated the children and then drowned or suffocated them one at a time.\n\nThe investigating officers believe that seeing a photo of her husband with a new partner was the incident that motivated the crime, which shocked Germany. She then messaged him that he would not see the children again.\n\nThe children\u2019s bodies were discovered in their beds on September 3, 2020.\n\nThe woman insisted that an intruder had broken into her home, tied her up and forced her to send chat messages before murdering the children.\n\nPsychiatric experts found no evidence of serious mental illness.\n\nHer defence lawyer called for her release on the grounds that doubts remained over whether his client had committed the murder.\n\nThe court found that Melina, 1, Leonie, 2, Sophie, 3, Timo, 6, and Luca, 8, had been murdered by their mother, who had subsequently thrown herself in front of a train at Dusseldorf central station but survived.\n\nShe had sent her eldest son, who survived unscathed, to his grandmother.",

          "text": "A video of a teacher scolding her pupil in a classroom, which is going viral on Twitter has left users of the platform divided.\n\nThe teacher could be seen trying to make the child write a sum on the board. Her effort also included smacking the child who apparently didn\u2019t understand what she was being told to do.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s method was frowned at by many after the video was shared on Twitter with the aim of reporting her to the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team.\n\nHowever, some didn\u2019t find anything wrong with her method as they revealed that they passed through the same to get to where they are today.\n\nOne Twitter user, @AkanPatrick1, said, \u201cThe fact that it happened to us doesn\u2019t make it right. The world has changed. There are better ways to teach and not behave like cavemen.\u201d\n\n@perrzy1 said, \u201cShe is frustrated clearly, she couldn\u2019t control her emotions but she doesn\u2019t hate that child. She simply needs more training. You simply don\u2019t understand the enormous pressure on private school teachers. Regardless of the situation, children shouldn\u2019t be treated that way.\u201d\n\nThe sharing of the video as done by @Gidi_Traffic was found to be mischievous by @Anthonykenechi1 who tweeted, \u201cYou may not be happy with the approach of the teaching. But she is doing it for the girl favour. But, the teacher should also know that we have slow learners.\u201d\n\n@GbolahanOsoneye replied, \u201cNo child can learn under pressure and fear\u2026there are better ways of teaching without being wicked,\u201d\n\n@Oluwatosindebo3 said, \u201cTeaching is not easy ooo, especially when the student isn\u2019t getting it right, she can choose to ignore but she just wants to try all her possible best to ensure the child gets it right at all cost.\u201d\n\nAccording to @metrumery, \u201cSome people who have never taught before are here talking nonsense. They are different kinds of students and they all assimilate differently. What the teacher did isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s a class of about 40 students, and I bet they will be more than one with such dull nature.\u201d\n\n@drangie_bae said, \u201cShe may just have a learning disability. All the pinching/beating in the world would not solve it. Quite sad. She needs extra lessons. I know of someone that had something similar. He just couldn\u2019t understand maths. But with extra lessons and no beating, he became a math guru.\u201d\n\n@Teamjhybo said, \u201cI cannot believe the people on this thread that think it\u2019s ACCEPTABLE for a teacher to Continually pinch a smack a child. The child is terrified she won\u2019t learn any faster, if anything she will be thinking of where the next pinch or slap is going to come from. What RUBBISH.\u201d\n\n@Babsfrey said, \u201cClearly, she\u2019s frustrated. I don\u2019t think she hates the child. I\u2019ve seen parents do this to their kids too. She needs more training to deal with her emotions and change teaching styles to suit the child\u2019s unique needs\u201d",

          "title": "How an APC win could reposition Anambra [Opinion]",
          "text": "By Pat Onukwuli\n\nAHEAD of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State the All Progressives Congress, APC, has received into its fold many people, including senators, members of the House of Representatives, members of the State House of Assembly, stakeholders and indeed the serving Deputy Governor.\n\nWhile switching over to the party from the ruling APGA government the Deputy Governor, Dr. Nkem Okeke said: \u201cAll over Anambra and indeed the South East region, the dominant complaint is the feeling of alienation by our people in the affairs of our country. And when you are so challenged, do you further go into your cocoon, or do you seek accommodation and understanding from your other compatriots\u201d?\n\nOkeke may not have said everything, but his views represent the silent majority who are no longer amused by the provincial politics that has kept Anambra State down. It is sad that the APGA government in an attempt to play down the damage the defections have done to the psyche of its members alluded to monetary inducement. But the truth, however, is that the people are tired of playing the game from the flank.\n\nThe argument that opposition politics has worked for the state and that she has no need to try something new falls flat in the face of reality. Few entrenched interest whose purpose the futile opposition politics serves have continued to manipulate the emotions of the people for a long time. And to sustain the deceit, they point to a likely state of uncertainty and lack of progress if another party is allowed a hold on government while cleverly passing middling achievements of the government as phenomenal success.\n\nIt is not the intention of this piece to punch holes in the argument as advanced, but to help further the positives of aligning with the centre for the greater good of the state. Arguing that Anambra does not need to belong to a major political party to achieve her dream of being one of the best performing states in Nigeria is not supported by facts check and the reality on ground. A state may be blessed with good managers and resources, but can be limited if she does play the right politics. This is especially so in the Third World countries where opposition is tolerated. A state like Anambra that produced leaders of Nigeria does not need to go cap in hand to take what belongs to her.\n\nFor example, the traffic frustrations the people face in the state today is partly incompetence and bad politics. The effort the state spent in explaining which is federal road and which is not could be put to other uses if our politics is right. But because incompetence breeds complaint and the tendency to whip up unnecessary sentiments, the state is happy to blame the Federal Government for all the woes. Although hooking up to the centre does not guarantee all there are to deal with challenges, but it should hold better for Anambra because of her uniqueness. There is no gainsaying that an Andy Ubah governorship under the APC holds many promises for the state, particularly in view of his wealth of experience and contact at the topmost level of government.\n\nAnambra cannot claim to be better off being a lone APGA state. The downside of this is not easily noticed because of the industry and self-reliant nature of an Anambra man. Electing Senator Andy Ubah, I have always argued, holds better opportunities for the state than continuing in dull and uncreative opposition. His wealth of experience and contact within the Nigerian state will help unlock the many potentials of the state yet to be harnessed.\n\nHis interest to transform the state and place her on a platform where she can comfortably negotiate with other states as equal partners should not be allowed to suffer stillbirth just because few beneficiaries of marginal politics in the state have said so through vicious propaganda.\n\nWe may have allowed obvious descent to vicious propaganda, but it does not take away the fact that Andy has the contact and reach to bring immediate transformation to the state. Even as the signs that the state is ready to do away with futile opposition on November 6 through mass defections into the APC, we still owe it ourselves to make effort to see it happen.\n\nFollowing from here Anambra does not want to sit idly by while major decisions are taken behind her. She wants to reclaim her lead role in propagating the Igbo agenda in the larger Nigerian context. It cannot be said with any sense of pride that the state has been operating at her full potentials since playing opposition politics in the last sixteen years. Whatever achievements seen in the state have been average and they beggar the ideals for which the state was created.\n\nThe number of years wasted, trying to contend with issues of federal concern should have been spent in dealing with development around the state. Many may want to argue that the state is doing well and should be left to continue to run on her own terms, but the evidence on ground does not support this. The state is yet to wear the look of a capital city more than 30 years after creation. The drawbacks of playing marginal politics are many which the few beneficiaries in the state are not ready to discard.\n\nAnambra State is too important to be isolated in national politics. She has a lot to gain by being in the big fold and a lot to lose by staying out of it. The concerted effort to demonize the APC and de-market its candidate Senator Andy Uba does not in any way hurt the decision of the people who have realised the need to integrate.\n\nMarginal politics does not serve any purpose except as a mine for those who propagate the idea that it is better to be a big fish in a sea than any other fish in an ocean. In the end, it does not profit the state as they have made the people to believe.\n\nDr. Onukwuli, a social commentator, wrote from Enugu via [email protected]",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Kaduna State chapter, has lamented that the shutdown of telecommunication services in some parts of the state has worsened the insecurity situation.\n\nHe observed that the shut down of the telecommunication network has further enabled bandits to have a field day on Sunday killing one and kidnapping over 100 Baptist Church worshippers.\n\nChairman of Kaduna CAN, Rev. John Joseph Hayab, expressed dismay that the security situation keeps on deteriorating, against the state government\u2019s claims that it was on top of the situation while citizens are at the receiving end on a daily basis.\n\nRev. Hayab noted that the insecurity in the state came to a climax on Sunday when bandits invaded Emmanuel Baptist Church during service, killed one, and abducted over 100 worshippers, while others sustained severe injuries without any security presence in the area, attributing the kidnapping of the worshippers to the shut down of the telecommunication network.\n\nHayab explained, \u201cWe are seriously worried now. Gunmen are gradually approaching the township. Emmanuel Baptist Church, which is in Kakau Daji, is just less than three kilometres to Sabon Tashan, yet the kidnappers operated at will without any resistance.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the truth about the shutdown of the network of telecommunication services is that people who are making policies are not fair to the citizens, adding that the government is doing trial and error, and this has not worked to curb insecurity in the state.\n\nAccording to Kaduna CAN, a victim\u2019s family said the kidnappers told them that they had to pay more on ransom because the gunmen had to go extra mile for network service before getting the victims\u2019 relations.\n\nHe added that the abducted church worshippers would have cried out on Sunday to facilitate their rescue and for people to know that they were endangered, but they could not cry out, lamenting that the shutdown of telecom network even assisted the bandits to carry out their illicit activities.\n\nHe suggested that unless appropriate measures are taken against insecurity in the state, the security challenges would continue to worsen and the citizens will continue suffering in the hands of the kidnappers.",

Similarly, the army headquarters garrisons have also deployed its soldiers to strategic spots to give the attackers the battle of their lives.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nThe operation, which started at midnight Tuesday, is said to have led to the arrest of some suspects who are now helping the security operatives with useful information.\n\nMotorists, especially those who live along the Abuja-Keffi Expressway, including Kugbo, Karu, Jikwoyi, Orozo, Karshi, Nyanya, Mararaba, one man village and Masaka, among other satellite towns, are finding it difficult passing through the road as a result of the road block mounted by soldiers of Guards Brigade, who are responsible for the security of the president, his immediate family, Very Important Personalities (VIP), as well as the FCT and its environs.\n\nA military source, who did not want to be mentioned in print, told Daily Sun that similar checkpoints have been mounted around the Abaji, Zuba and Bwari areas to arrest the suspects before they gain access into the city.\n\nThe source further revealed that the joint task force had commenced the raid of all black spots in the FCT, and that some suspects have been arrested. The source, who confided in Daily Sun, said that intelligence gathered in the last few days revealed the planned attack and an influx of motorcycle riders into the FCT, on a daily basis, a development said to be giving the military and other security agencies concerns as kidnapping and attacks on villages in the FCT become a daily affair.\n\nThe source said that the invasion of the university of Abuja, early Tuesday morning, by bandits who abducted some staff members and their families, may not be unconnected with the security alert even as soldiers are in hot pursuit to apprehend the criminals.\n\nSources alleged that some villagers may have connived with the criminals who attacked the university staff quarters as it took sometime before they could alert the police who, in turn, alerted soldiers of 176 Guards Battalion, located around Gwagwalada. Unfortunately, by the time they got there, the criminals had escaped. It was also gathered that the non fencing of the university premises and location of the staff quarters, said to be right inside the bush, made it very easy for the criminals to have easy access into the premises.\n\nWhile the soldiers alongside operatives of the police anti kidnapping units were said to be in hot pursuit of the attackers, the kidnappers were yet to make contacts with families of the kidnapped victims.\n\nWhen contacted the Commander, Guards Brigade, confirmed the security checkpoints by the soldiers. He, however, did not state why they mounted the security checkpoints even though soldiers have been in that particular spot for sometime now.\n\nMeanwhile, barely 24 hours after the kidnap of members of staff of the University of Abuja, their abductors are demanding N300 million ransom for their release.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Vows to prosecute election offenders\n\n\u2022IG issues stern warning, says heavy deployment to protect all\n\n\u2022IPAC demands fairness, transparency from commission, security operatives\n\n\u2022US threatens visa restriction on violence instigators\n\n\u2022Obaigbena thanks CDS, Police Chief, DG SSS for providing robust security during ARISE News debate\n\nChuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and\n\nDavid-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nAs the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) moves both personnel and materials to Anambra State in readiness for the governorship election yesterday, INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmoud Yakubu, has said the commission would do everything in its powers to ensure only eligible voters determine the next governor of the South-east state. Yakubu stated this on Wednesday in Awka during a pre-election stakeholders meeting with the political parties, religious leaders, traditional rulers, and civil society groups.\n\nBut the commission was quick to add, \u201cWe are also determined to prosecute perpetrators of electoral malpractice, including any election duty staff found to be complicit. The choice of the next governor of Anambra State is in the hands of the eligible voters and their will must prevail.\u201d\n\nInspector General of Police (IGP), Mr. Usman Baba, issued a stern warning on the general conduct of people during the election. Baba said the police were determined to guarantee a peaceful election in the state. He explained that the heavy deployment of security personnel to the state was not to scare away voters, but to protect everyone.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, thanked the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, and the Director General of the Department of State Security, DSS, Mr. Yusuf Magaji Bichi, for providing solid security during the ARISE News and Enough is Enough group jointly organised governorship debate in Awka, the Anambra state capital on Monday. He explained that other media houses pulled out of participating in the debate because of security concerns, \u201cessentially, other media houses had pulled out of the debate; some wanted it done in Abuja, owing to security fears, but Arise News Channel refused, insisting that we can\u2019t run away from any part of the country. The CDS assured of security and he lived up to his word.\u201d Obaigbena urged the security forces to provide the same security so that voters will come to go and cast their vote for candidate of their choice and \u201cwe are urging them to extend same security for the election to encourage people to vote.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, Tthe Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), on its part, asked INEC and all the security personnel deployed for the governorship election to ensure the process was credible, fair, and transparent.\n\nAccordingly, the United States warned that anyone, who interfered with the lawful conduct of the election or instigated violence, would face visa restrictions along with their families.\n\nYakubu, speaking at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting, said some of the sensitive materials had been secured at the Anambra State branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Awka.\n\nThe INEC chairman said as a usual practice on the eve of major elections, INEC would invite political parties, civil society organisations, and the media to the CBN on Thursday to inspect the sensitive materials and witness their movement to the various local government areas under security escort.\n\nBy the same arrangement, Yakubu said the materials would be delivered to the Registration Areas or Wards on Friday to facilitate the opening of Polling Units at 8.30am on Election Day.\n\nHe assured voters in the state that in designing the sensitive materials for the election, the commission had introduced additional visible and invisible security features, including different colour codes. He said election materials had also been customised according to local government areas and polling units, warning those who may attempt to compromise the process that INEC has put in place sufficient security features to detect counterfeits.\n\nThe INEC chairman stated, \u201cOn Saturday, 6th November 2021, Anambra State will make history as the first governorship election in Nigeria in which the commission will deploy the Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) device. This new device replaces the Smart Card Reader (SCR) used in previous elections since 2015.\n\n\u201cWe are satisfied with the pilot deployment of the BVAS in the Isoko South I State Constituency bye-election in Delta State on 11th September 2021. The BVAS has the dual capacity for fingerprint and facial authentication of voters. This is to guard against voting by identity theft, where one person uses another person\u2019s Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to vote using the incident form.\n\n\u201cWith this development, the use of the incident form is abolished. No voter without genuine PVC will vote. No voter, who has not been successfully accredited electronically, using the BVAS, will vote.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the BVAS is also equipped with a camera. Therefore, it has the capacity to snap Polling Unit level result and upload same to the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal, so that citizens can view results as election is concluded in each Polling Unit.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is no need for the Z-Pad since its functions have been embedded in the BVAS. I am glad to report that all the BVAS required for the election on Saturday have been configured and delivered to Anambra State. Election duty staff have also been trained on the use of the device and we have sufficient technical staff to respond to any glitches that may occur.\u201d\n\nYakubu acknowledged concerns expressed about the availability of PVCs for new registrants in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the end of the recent Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, a total of 138,802 citizens completed the registration. After cleaning up the data, the commission identified and archived 62,698 multiple registrants. Consequently, the number of valid registrants is 76,104.\n\n\u201cThis figure has been added to 5,674 requests for transfer, update of voter information and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs, bringing the total of valid registrations to 81,774. I am glad to report that the PVCs have been printed and delivered to all the local government areas for collection by voters.\n\n\u201cWe have also contacted the voters by text messages and email addresses and informed them of the exact locations to collect their cards. Through the media, we have also been sensitising them to the availability of the cards for collection. Many of them have done so already. Let me, therefore, once again appeal to those that have not done so that their cards are available for collection.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of voters\u2019 distribution by polling units, Yakubu stated, \u201cAbout four weeks ago, the commission published the register of voters for the election on 7th October 2021 i.e. 30 days to the election as required by law. Each of the 18 political parties was given a soft copy of the register here in Awka. In addition to meeting, the requirement of the law, the presentation of the register is significant for another reason.\n\n\u201cThe Anambra governorship election is the first time that voting is taking place in polling units since the recent successful conversion of voting points arising from the expansion of voter access to polling units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn additional 1,112 polling units were established in Anambra State in addition to the existing 4,608 locations. This brings the total number of polling units in the state to 5,720. Voters were encouraged to seize the opportunity of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to transfer to the new polling units most convenient for them. Many did not do so.\n\n\u201cThis can be partly attributed to the security situation in the state, which has affected the commission\u2019s pre-election outdoor activities, including voter education and sensitisation. Understandably, the voters have also been cautious.\u201d\n\nYakubu explained that out of the 5,720 polling units in the state, 86 (1.5%) had no voters. He said the commission would not deploy personnel and materials to these polling units. \u201cFurthermore, 894 (15.6%) of the polling units have between one and 49 voters. Election will hold in these polling units. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that all Polling Units have voters allotted to them ahead of the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nIG Issues Stern Warning, Says Deployment Not to Scare Anyone\n\nInspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, yesterday, read the riot act to troublemakers ahead of the Anambra State governorship election. Baba said at a meeting with political parties, religious leaders, and traditional rulers that the police were determined to ensure a peaceful election.\n\nHowever, he allayed fears and concerns about the heavy security deployment in the state, saying it is not meant to scare away voters, but to reassure them of their security and safety.\n\nThe IGP said, \u201cIt is to be additionally emphasised that aside these sets of guidelines, which fall under the provisions of the Electoral Act, any person that violates any components of the criminal laws, including being in possession of weapons of violence of any description, either on the streets or around the polling units, engages in any violent act, attacks critical national assets, engages in corrupt inducement of the electorate, or threatens public peace in any manner before, during and after the election, shall be apprehended and dealt with in accordance with the requisite criminal law.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, call on all the political parties to embrace the virtues of democracy by seeing elections as a call to service by the people and not \u2018a-do or die\u2019 affair.\u201d\n\nBaba implored parents and guardians to discourage their children and wards from being used to foment trouble or subvert the election process, warning, \u201cSuch will be forcefully resisted by the Nigeria Police, the military and other security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe IGP said residents and voters should be guided by the following rules, as contained in the Electoral Act, on the election day.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNo one is allowed to wear any cloth, emblem or colour signifying any political party to the polling units.\n\n\u201cNo person is allowed to move around with security details around the polling units. Indeed, appropriate directives have been given for the withdrawal or scaling down of such security details around politically exposed persons and other personalities in the state until after the elections.\n\n\u201cEveryone is enjoined to vote and return to their respective houses or remain peacefully within approved perimeters of the polling centres. No one is allowed to move about from one polling unit to another, as there shall be restriction of movements on the day of the election.\n\n\u201cOnly INEC accredited Election Monitors/observers are allowed to move around for the purpose of election monitoring and they must all wear their INEC accreditation tags. Only accredited journalists are allowed to cover the election. All such journalists must carry their accreditation tags.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the massive deployment of security was \u201cnot designed to intimidate the law-abiding, as being insinuated in some quarters. In the contrary, it is to re-assure them of adequate protection by deterring misguided political elements as well as non-state actors that might be bent on threatening the elections through acts of armed violence or other conducts that violate the provisions of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cIt is to also serve as a strong warning that the government is determined to bring such subversive characters to justice should they advance their ignoble, undemocratic and unpatriotic intents. The overriding objective of our operational action plan is to ensure an environment that is peaceful enough to encourage the law-abiding people of Anambra State to exercise their electoral franchise.\n\nIPAC Demands Fairness, Transparency from INEC, Security Agencies\n\nInter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and all the security personnel deployed for the election in Anambra State to ensure a credible, fair and transparent electoral process. It urged the youth in the state to eschew violence and \u201cshun political buccaneers masquerading as democrats, whose stock in trade is to use them for electoral thuggery, ballot snatching and rigging to thwart the people\u2019s mandate\u201d.\n\nIPAC said it had received assurances from relevant quarters that the result of the election would be transmitted electronically.\n\nAddressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, National Chairman of IPAC, Mr. Leonard Nzenwa, who is also National Chairman, African Action Congress (AAC), said it was important for INEC and the security agencies to commit to fairness and transparency during the election, and not compromise their integrity.\n\nNzenwa stated, \u201cINEC should provide a level playing field to all political parties and their candidates participating in the election and ensure electoral materials are provided, and that voting starts as scheduled in all polling units in the state.\n\n\u201cThe neutrality of INEC in this election will determine the survival of democracy in Nigeria. All eyes are on the commission and its officials as they discharge this onerous civic responsibility. Security agents should also discharge their duties professionally and ensure adequate protection of lives and property during the exercise.\u201d\n\nUS Threatens Visa Restriction on Violence Instigators\n\nThe United States warned that visa restrictions would be imposed anyone who interfered with the lawful conduct of the Anambra election or instigated violence. A statement on Wednesday from the US Embassy said the American government looked forward to a peaceful and transparent governorship election whose results would accurately reflect the will of the people of the state.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe will be paying close attention to actions of individuals, who interfere with the democratic process or instigate violence against civilian populations before, during, or after the elections.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to consider consequences, including visa restrictions, for those found to be responsible for election-related violence or undermining the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe statement further explained, \u201cUnder US immigration law, certain violations also may lead to restrictions on family members.\u201d\n\nIt called on citizens, electoral officials, party members, and security force personnel to do their part in ensuring a credible and secure electoral process.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Appoints town planners\u2019 president as chairman, team gets 30 days to submit report\n\n\u2022Femi Osibona, owner of building, friend, Wale Bob-Oseni, still unaccounted for\n\nSegun James\n\nThe six-man independent investigation team set up by Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to probe the remote and immediate causes of the collapse of a 21-storey building in Ikoyi has 30 days to submit its report. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this yesterday as he named members of the probe panel at the site of the incident.\n\nHowever, it was all tears yesterday as the body of Nifemi, the personal assistant to Femi Osibona, the owner of the building, which collapsed in Ikoyi area of Lagos on Monday, was recovered.\n\nBut Managing Director of Fourscore Heights Limited, Osibona, who was trapped under the rubble alongside Nifemi and Wale Bob-Oseni, his friend, were yet to be recovered 48 hours after the incident.\n\nA source said, \u201cThe dead body of the PA (Personal Assistant) to the owner of the collapsed Lagos building has been recovered. The police orderly of the owner says Osibona is trapped in the rubble with his friend, Wale Bob-Oseni.\u201d\n\nBob-Oseni is also a property and real estate dealer like Osibona.\n\nA father whose son\u2019s body was recovered cried uncontrollably at the scene.\n\nAt the time of this report, 23 people had been confirmed dead since the building located on Gerrard Road collapsed. Rescue efforts were still on-going, as families and friends of those trapped in the rubble quailed and hoped for good news.\n\nNine persons were evacuated alive from the rubble.\n\nMembers of the probe panel announced by Sanwo-Olu comprised a professional builder, town planner, structural engineer, and legal practitioners \u2013 all from the private sector.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, President of Nigeria Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr. Tayo Ayinde, is the chairman of the panel, while Ekundayo Onajobi, a lawyer in a private law firm, is the secretary.\n\nOther members of the panel are a structural engineer, Dr. Akintilo Idris Adeleke; an architect, Yinka Ogundairo; representative of Institute of Builders, Mr. Godfrey O. Godfrey; and Mrs. Bunmi Ibrahim, a property lawyer.\n\nThe panel\u2019s terms of reference include ascertaining whether there was a compromise of the building codes by the developer, his contractor, and statutory regulatory agencies.\n\nAlready, General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Arc. Gbolahan Oki, had been suspended indefinitely by the governor.\n\nSanwo-Olu was on an official visit to Rome in Italy for the G-20 Summit when he learnt of the incident on Monday. The governor cut short his trip and returned to Lagos on Tuesday to attend to the emergency.\n\nArriving at the scene in the wee-hours of yesterday, the governor met with the victims\u2019 family members, raising their hopes and showing compassion to calm them.\n\nHe described the incident as \u201ca monumental disaster\u201d, hinting that mistakes must have been made in the process of developing the collapsed structure. The governor promised a thorough inquiry into the matter, adding that the full wrath of the law would be brought on anyone found to have compromised.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cWe\u2019ve promised to be open and thorough in investigating the cause of the collapse. In that regard, I have set up a high-powered professional investigative panel whose membership consists of professionals outside of the government. The panel members have been given clear terms of reference and we are giving them a 30-day assignment to tell us what has gone wrong at the site.\n\n\u201cThe panel will be finding out who the culprits are. The investigation will start from the heads of regulatory agencies. Be rest assured that if there are other people that are found wanting in the course of investigation, everybody will face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cMembers of the panel are people of impeccable integrity and I will be signing an Executive Order to give the panel a legal backing.\u201d\n\nOther terms of reference of the panel include determining whether there was full compliance with physical planning and building materials laws of the state; determining whether there was supervisory or oversight lapses on the part of regulatory agencies; and making necessary recommendations to guard against reoccurrence of similar incidents.\n\nSanwo-Olu maintained that it was difficult for the government to know the exact number of people trapped, noting that none of the people linked to the housing project has come forward to offer information on the manifest.\n\nHe said, \u201cI express my deepest sympathy to the families of those that have been involved in this unfortunate incident. For the bodies recovered from the site, we are currently conducting systematic process of identifying them.\n\n\u201cBefore the end of today or tomorrow, the process would have been completed and family members can come forward to identify them.\u201d\n\nThe state government set up a medical base and information desk at the site of the building collapse, and urged those whose family members were still missing to offer information on their identities. There is also a website (www.lagosmind.org/help) and helpline number (09090006463) for the distressed families.\n\nThe multi-sectoral search and rescue operation was ongoing at press time. The effort was led by teams from Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), with the support of construction giants, Julius Berger, Craneburg, HiTech, and China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC).\n\nThose rescued from the rubble were Oduntan Timilehin, 26; Sunday Monday, 21; Adeniran Mayowa, 37; Sholagbade Nurudeen, 33; Waliu Lateef, 32; and Ahmed Kanleku, a 19-year-old Beninoise.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Rallies IOCs to embark on major oil, gas devt projects\n\n\u2022 OPTS seeks commission\u2019s support to address operational challenges\n\n\u2022 Promotes 195 staff\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nIn continuation of his ongoing engagements with critical stakeholders in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC), Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, yesterday met with oil majors operating in the country on the aegis of Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS).\n\nAt the meeting held in Lagos at the commission\u2019s oil and gas excellence centre, Komolafe, while responding to concerns raised by the operators, assured them that the commission would work towards removing all forms of bureaucracies that could escalate high cost of oil production in the country.\n\nMembers of OPTS who attended the meeting were their Chairman and Managing Director of Chevron Nigeria Limited, Mr. Rick Kennedy; immediate-past OPTS Chairman and Managing Director of TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, Mr. Mike Sangster; and Managing Director of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) Nigeria Limited, Mr. Osagie Okunbo.\n\nOthers were Managing Director of ExxonMobil Nigeria Limited; Mr. Richard Laing; and his counterpart at Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC), Mr. Roberto Daniele.\n\nThe OPTS had in the session, listed some of their concerns that needed to be looked into by the commission as security, lengthy contract cycle terms, administrative complexities, the timelines in certain areas in the PIA, and the uncertainty on some issues, like the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) that are being renegotiated.\n\nKomolafe said the overriding objective of the meeting was to enable him familiarise himself with the oil producers as critical stakeholders, adding that he wanted to hear their challenges while seeking their partnership in the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nHe said as a business enabler, the upstream commission would operate and regulate with best industry practices and would continue to remain very transparent.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will try as much as possible to remove all forms of bureaucracies that could escalate cost of production in the upstream.\u201d\n\nHe told the international oil company (IOC) chief executives that the implementation of the PIA was very germane to President Muhammadu Buhari, saying the task before the commission was to see critical deliverables from the Act within 12 months.\n\nHe urged the OPTS to support the commission in ensuring that key upstream development projects were started.\n\nKomolafe said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, the task for us is to see how, within the next six to 12 months, to begin to see critical deliverables from the Petroleum Industry Act -I mean, development of key upstream projects. And we really need your support as critical stakeholders in this respect.\u201d\n\nNoting that he was aware of the challenges facing them in the course of their activities in the upstream, Komolafe, who admitted that the industry, generally, was facing a critical period especially in this energy transition era, added that they were monitoring critically, the discussions in Glasgow, Scotland, on climate change.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe realise that the outcome is really posing challenges to which we need to address. We understand that at the moment, the upstream business is facing critical funding challenge, among other challenges that are very particular to our terrain.\n\n\u201cSo, my overriding key objective here today like I said, is to first and foremost, familiarise myself with you, realising that for us to be efficient regulator, we really need to be able to identify with your activities and know your challenges. At least, with that, we will be able to regulate objectively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using this opportunity to give credence to you as our critical operators. So, I want to solicit your cooperation and to assure you that we shall work as partners, we will work in synergy in a manner that we would be able to achieve the overall intendment of the Petroleum Industry Act, in a manner that would achieve optimal benefit to the Nigerian federation from our God-given hydrocarbon resources.\u201d\n\nThe Head, Legal, NURC, Dr. Tolorunse Joseph, while reacting to the issues raised by the operators regarding compliance to the PIA transition timeline, said the regulator was working with the PIA implementation committee to ensure that the timelines were met and the transition taken place smoothly without any hiccup.\n\nOn the conversion of oil mining licenses (OML) to oil prospecting license (OPL), Joseph explained that the even though it was provided that that should happen with 18 months, the decision to convert remained the decision of the operator.\n\n\u201cFlexibility is provided under the law in which the decision to convert is left for the operator. It\u2019s not a compulsion. So, the timeline, even though it\u2019s stipulated to be within 18 months, it\u2019s at the discretion of the operator.\n\n\u201cSo, there are many timelines stipulated for certain activities in the law, like the Host Community that says within one year, they should incorporate the Host Community Development Fund,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue around the ongoing renegotiated Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and how the PIA applies to it, Joseph explained, \u201cYou also raised the issue of Deep-water renegotiated PSC. I think the Deep-water Renegotiated PSC that have taken place before the Act was passed, also will continue under the old regime unless it is converted to the new regime as provided under the Act.\n\n\u201cSo, the Renegotiated PSC is a contractual arrangement. Definitely, it\u2019s going to be given effect within the law. It\u2019s going to remain substantially the same, unless you convert it to the new law.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Head, National Data Repository, NURC, Mr. Indabawa Bashari, responding to the issue about the compliance to the gas flare out deadline, said 2030 remained the compliance deadline as fixed by to United Nations.\n\nHe urged the operators to working towards complying before the 2030 deadline.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues raised is on gas flare elimination. We still maintain the 2030 deadline set by the United Nations. So, we expect every company to work toward achieving that deadline. From now till 2030, we have nine years. You should work towards achieving flare out before the deadline\u201d, Bashari said.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of OPTS, Kennedy listed some of their concerns that needed to be looked into by the commission as security, lengthy contract cycle terms, administrative complexities, the timelines in certain areas in the PIA, and the uncertainty on some issues, like the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) that are being renegotiated and how the PIA affects them.\n\nHe said OPTS had been looking deeply into the PIA and had identified a number of opportunities for collaboration and partnership with the commission.\n\nHe said, \u201cOne, is really on transition timeline, to be in compliance with the terms with the PIA. There is a number of compliance and mandatory items that the industry really has to get in place very quickly. And so, we look to collaborate with you and your team on those areas, hoping we can manage that effectively.\n\n\u201cA couple of examples in that area is incorporation of the Development Trust with the host communities, and it requires some alignment with multiple stakeholders. So, we have to manage that transition very effectively.\u201d\n\nKennedy said the OPTS had gone through the PIA and identified potential ambiguities on areas where they were not quite clear on the intent of the law.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have areas where regulations will get to be issued and potentially, this needs further guidelines. So, we stand ready to work with you and your team to provide inputs and supports as appropriate, in the development of new guidelines. An example is, the regulation on the decommissioning fund probably needs to prepared.\n\n\u201cThere is a number of ongoing discussions on renegotiation of existing Production Sharing Contracts in the Deep-water between the operators and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). And the PIA has a provision to allow those ongoing negotiation to be completed within 12 months of the enactment of the Act.\n\n\u201cWe have finished that work with the NNPC, but we have to come through the commission to let you know that we are still on that stage. We will be looking to work with you and your team to try to bring closure to those within the allotted time.\n\n\u201cThe other things are things around relative security, lengthy contract cycle terms, general administrative complexities, the industry is currently burdened with a number of fees and levies, and through the PIA, we see the potential of additional levies will be applied to the industry. So, we will be happy to work with you and your team to perhaps, identify opportunities to manage and improve cost.\u201d\n\nHe said energy transition offered the country an opportunity around developing the gas resources, adding however, that something has to be done around the fiscal environment to encourage investment in that area.\n\nAccording to him, some of the regulations would need to be tailored towards further enabling development of dry gas and associated gas and in the area of supporting domestication of gas.\n\nKennedy earlier congratulated Komolafe for his appointment and inauguration, the launch of the commission represents a major milestone in the reform and operationalisation of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry, given the long journey to finally enact the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cSo, we are just happy to be here and part of this milestone in the industry -a really significant milestone for the country and federation of Nigeria. We would gladly engage with you and your team on discussions towards understanding the challenges that we all face.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to a collaboration where we can work together, perhaps, on future regulations on how we manage the business effectively on behalf of the Government of Nigeria, the people of Nigeria and all relevant stakeholders\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Komolafe has approved the immediate promotion of 195 members of staff of the new commission.\n\nSpeaking on the matter on Tuesday, the NUPRC boss noted that human capital remained a critical factor in the oil industry, declaring that the decision was part of the determination of the federal government to look after the welfare of the staff of the organisation.\n\n\u201cIt is only when staff are happy that we can talk of improving our crude oil production quota, which is presently below what we should be producing.\n\n\u201cIn that line, I have approved the promotion of 195 union staff that have been stagnated in the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to stave off industrial crisis.\n\n\u201cAny crisis can further harm the low daily oil production in Nigeria and worsen the nation\u2019s federally generated oil revenue,\u201d Komolafe argued.\n\nThe NUPRC boss said the decision to promote the staff followed his engagements and assurances to the agitated staff, adding that the measure would help boost staff morale.\n\nHe further promised to ensure that the staff are not short-changed in the unfolding transition and manpower reorganisations as the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) begins in earnest.\n\nHe noted that there remains a positive correlation between boosting the nation\u2019s crude production for optimised federation revenue and elevated staff morale in the commission.\n\nKomolafe who emphasised the critical nature of the oil and gas sector to the Nigerian economy, noted that with the call for divestments in the sector by key global stakeholders, it was best to maximise the benefits from fossil fuels to improve the welfare Nigerians and those who toil to get it out of the ground.\n\n\u201cSo, what we have done is by extension to improve the nation\u2019s revenue by increasing crude oil production from the current level of 1.4 mbbls/d to 2.4 mbbls/d,\u201d he added.\n\nHe urged the staff to reciprocate the gesture with enhanced service delivery in their determination to leave a legacy as a 21st century regulator and business enabler.\n\nKomolafe had last week during a podcast to staff across the country, promised to be fair to all and sundry, vowing to do all in his capacity to address issues of workers\u2019 welfare and give priority to good industrial relations.\n\n\u201cHuman capital capacity development will be stringently pursued to ensure high standard of professionalism at all times,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chief executive disclosed that the exercise was in recognition of the resilience and hard work put in by staff to meet the aspirations of government for the upstream sector of the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Vice President Osinbajo Linked To Lagos Collapsed Building With Current Death Toll Of 36 Persons",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has been linked to the collapsed uncompleted 21-storey building in Lagos State.\n\nOn Monday, the building located on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos collapsed with a yet-to-be-ascertained number of persons still trapped beneath the rubble.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported on Thursday that no fewer than 36 persons have been confirmed dead at the site of the collapsed 21-storey building.\n\nThe rescue and emergency personnel have evacuated nine persons alive from the debris of the fallen building.\n\nThe survivors comprised eight males and one female, while the fatalities had three females and 33 males. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Lagos Building Collapse: Death Toll Hits 36 As Nine Rescued Alive\n\nDifferent sources on Tuesday told SaharaReporters that the landed property was bought by Osinbajo from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, founder of Elizade Motors (Elizade Nigeria Limited) shortly after he became the Vice President.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo is linked to the property, that house that collapsed on Monday in Lagos State. I was aware when he got the landed property from Elizade. A woman was selling food at the place before, that was where all workers and labourers working around here do eat,\u201d a facility manager told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President has a lot of properties in the area, he is using his brother to manage the properties. The developer, Femi Osibona is only fronting for him. Osinbajo even bought another property for his brother in the area, it\u2019s at Mosley Street. The brother is the one managing it personally, he comes there almost every time.\n\n\u201cIf the Lagos State Government is serious, they should tell us who owns the land.\"\n\nThe developer's brother, Lanre Osibona was Senior Special Assistant to the President on ICT from May 2015 to December 2019.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, another source said, \u201cI know the land was bought by the Vice President from Elizade. I can\u2019t really say maybe he sold it to Osibona. I know when the land was bought. That\u2019s where we do eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he owns the land, what are you expecting, so you expect a whole Vice President to put his name in such project. He can never put his name, Femi Osibona, Fourscore Managing Director is only a front in this project. The Vice President wanted the project to finish before 2023,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\nA staff member of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) told SaharaReporters that there \u2018was an order from above\u2019 not to visit the building during monitoring.\n\nHe wondered why the General Manager of the agency, Gbolahan Oki, was suspended and the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako not punished.\n\n\u201cWhy the GM? The man that just assumed office, what about the commissioner that passes through the road everyday on his paper tiger monitoring? Let the governor suspend him and his PS as well,\u201d he said. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Governor Sanwo-Olu Suspends Lagos Building Agency Boss Over Ikoyi Building Collapse\n\n\u201cI know the building is owned by a top government official, the man in question, Osibona was only fronting for that government official. We received an order from above to stop going to the site during monitoring. I heard the Vice President intervened when the project was sealed off early in the year but I can\u2019t say maybe he is the owner. Don\u2019t forget they are both from Ikenne in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nAccording to Highbrow Living Magazine, the collapsed property, comprising four-bedroom maisonettes, flats, duplex and penthouses, was 65 percent sold out.\n\nThe price range for the apartment is also said to be between $1.2 million and $5 million.\n\n\u201cThe 20-floor strictly residential facility is the brain works of Fourscore Homes, evolving from a desire to build an original masterpiece. The concept is to have service flats in the three towers for residents to experience a stress-free lifestyle, complete with a hotel flair with a 360-degree view of Lagos state,\u201d the magazine reads.\n\nThe structure was said to be 80 percent completed and was billed to be concluded in 2022.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Osibona had said the project was supposed to be the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis development will give peace of mind and comfort to the residents, because everything works,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cWe have exhibited our expertise in property development in the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States of America and Nigeria. Fourscore Homes possesses uncommon capabilities in redefining property development in any market we choose to play in.\n\n\u201cI was one of the people whose real estate developments led to the growth of East London. I bought a house on New Cross Road and renovated it. I also bought a piece of land behind it and built two flats there, and that is what I will call my first real estate project. That was how I started building houses for sale.\u201d\n\nDespite initial denial, SaharaReporters gathered that the Lagos State Government only approved the construction of 15 storeys for the collapsed building.\n\nThere have been controversies over the actual structure approved for construction after the building collapsed on Monday, leaving at least 22 people dead.\n\nOn Monday, Oki, the suspended general manager of LASBCA had claimed that the government approved 15 floors for the 21-storey building.\n\n\u201cHe got approval for a 15-storey building and he exceeded his limit. I am on the ground here and the materials he used are so inferior and terrible,\u201d Oki had said.\n\nBut addressing journalists at the site of the collapsed building on Tuesday, Obafemi Hamzat, the Deputy Governor, said the owner of the building got approval for 21 floors.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThis particular one was approved for 21 floors, not 15. If you count, the second building was 14 or 15. The approval was done about three years ago, it is not something new, it is the construction that failed apparently from what we can see.\"\n\nHamzat also confirmed the earlier sealing of the building by the state government over poor construction.\n\nHe had added: \u201cIt was sealed from June. It was sealed because the agency came in to do a structural test, they saw some abnormalities, so they shut it down for those things to be corrected. See Also News How Lagos Government Lied Owner Of Collapsed Building Had Approval For 21 Storeys And Not 15 Floors\n\n\u201cThey were taking corrective actions when this (collapse) happened.\"\n\nIn a document, obtained by SaharaReporters, however, it was revealed that only 15 floors were actually approved for the project.\n\nThe Development Permit, dated April 2019, was approved by the Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) on 09/04/2019.\n\nIt reads partly, \u201cFor Fourscore Height Limited, 44 B,C,D Gerrard Road, Ikoyi. Permission under the provisions of the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2010 Physical Development Regulations to erect a residential 15 floors building at 44 B, C, D Gerrard Road, Ikoyi (West).\"\n\nIt further said, \"(a) The Planning Permit granted shall become invalid where development has (2) years of the grant of such permit unless the permit is revalidated by the Authority.\n\n\u201c(b) Every developer shall, on the procurement of his permit proceed to Lagos State Building Control Agency, to give notice of his or her intention to commence Development at Oba Akinjobi Way, Old Secretariat, GRA, Ikeja.\n\n\u201c(c) The Subject site shall be clearly demarcated in accordance with the site plan and be made ready for Development.

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has been linked to the collapsed uncompleted 21-storey building in Lagos State.\n\nOn Monday, the building located on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos collapsed with a yet-to-be-ascertained number of persons still trapped beneath the rubble.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported on Thursday that no fewer than 36 persons have been confirmed dead at the site of the collapsed 21-storey building.\n\nThe rescue and emergency personnel have evacuated nine persons alive from the debris of the fallen building.\n\nThe survivors comprised eight males and one female, while the fatalities had three females and 33 males. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Lagos Building Collapse: Death Toll Hits 36 As Nine Rescued Alive\n\nDifferent sources on Tuesday told SaharaReporters that the landed property was bought by Osinbajo from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, founder of Elizade Motors (Elizade Nigeria Limited) shortly after he became the Vice President.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo is linked to the property, that house that collapsed on Monday in Lagos State. I was aware when he got the landed property from Elizade. A woman was selling food at the place before, that was where all workers and labourers working around here do eat,\u201d a facility manager told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President has a lot of properties in the area, he is using his brother to manage the properties. The developer, Femi Osibona is only fronting for him. Osinbajo even bought another property for his brother in the area, it\u2019s at Mosley Street. The brother is the one managing it personally, he comes there almost every time.\n\n\u201cIf the Lagos State Government is serious, they should tell us who owns the land.\"\n\nThe developer's brother, Lanre Osibona was Senior Special Assistant to the President on ICT from May 2015 to December 2019.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, another source said, \u201cI know the land was bought by the Vice President from Elizade. I can\u2019t really say maybe he sold it to Osibona. I know when the land was bought. That\u2019s where we do eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he owns the land, what are you expecting, so you expect a whole Vice President to put his name in such project. He can never put his name, Femi Osibona, Fourscore Managing Director is only a front in this project. The Vice President wanted the project to finish before 2023,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\nA staff member of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) told SaharaReporters that there \u2018was an order from above\u2019 not to visit the building during monitoring.\n\nHe wondered why the General Manager of the agency, Gbolahan Oki, was suspended and the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako not punished.\n\n\u201cWhy the GM? The man that just assumed office, what about the commissioner that passes through the road everyday on his paper tiger monitoring? Let the governor suspend him and his PS as well,\u201d he said. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Governor Sanwo-Olu Suspends Lagos Building Agency Boss Over Ikoyi Building Collapse\n\n\u201cI know the building is owned by a top government official, the man in question, Osibona was only fronting for that government official. We received an order from above to stop going to the site during monitoring. I heard the Vice President intervened when the project was sealed off early in the year but I can\u2019t say maybe he is the owner. Don\u2019t forget they are both from Ikenne in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nAccording to Highbrow Living Magazine, the collapsed property, comprising four-bedroom maisonettes, flats, duplex and penthouses, was 65 percent sold out.\n\nThe price range for the apartment is also said to be between $1.2 million and $5 million.\n\n\u201cThe 20-floor strictly residential facility is the brain works of Fourscore Homes, evolving from a desire to build an original masterpiece. The concept is to have service flats in the three towers for residents to experience a stress-free lifestyle, complete with a hotel flair with a 360-degree view of Lagos state,\u201d the magazine reads.\n\nThe structure was said to be 80 percent completed and was billed to be concluded in 2022.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Osibona had said the project was supposed to be the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis development will give peace of mind and comfort to the residents, because everything works,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cWe have exhibited our expertise in property development in the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States of America and Nigeria. Fourscore Homes possesses uncommon capabilities in redefining property development in any market we choose to play in.\n\n\u201cI was one of the people whose real estate developments led to the growth of East London. I bought a house on New Cross Road and renovated it. I also bought a piece of land behind it and built two flats there, and that is what I will call my first real estate project. That was how I started building houses for sale.\u201d\n\nDespite initial denial, SaharaReporters gathered that the Lagos State Government only approved the construction of 15 storeys for the collapsed building.\n\nThere have been controversies over the actual structure approved for construction after the building collapsed on Monday, leaving at least 22 people dead.\n\nOn Monday, Oki, the suspended general manager of LASBCA had claimed that the government approved 15 floors for the 21-storey building.\n\n\u201cHe got approval for a 15-storey building and he exceeded his limit. I am on the ground here and the materials he used are so inferior and terrible,\u201d Oki had said.\n\nBut addressing journalists at the site of the collapsed building on Tuesday, Obafemi Hamzat, the Deputy Governor, said the owner of the building got approval for 21 floors.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThis particular one was approved for 21 floors, not 15. If you count, the second building was 14 or 15. The approval was done about three years ago, it is not something new, it is the construction that failed apparently from what we can see.\"\n\nHamzat also confirmed the earlier sealing of the building by the state government over poor construction.\n\nHe had added: \u201cIt was sealed from June. It was sealed because the agency came in to do a structural test, they saw some abnormalities, so they shut it down for those things to be corrected. See Also News How Lagos Government Lied Owner Of Collapsed Building Had Approval For 21 Storeys And Not 15 Floors\n\n\u201cThey were taking corrective actions when this (collapse) happened.\"\n\nIn a document, obtained by SaharaReporters, however, it was revealed that only 15 floors were actually approved for the project.\n\nThe Development Permit, dated April 2019, was approved by the Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) on 09/04/2019.\n\nIt reads partly, \u201cFor Fourscore Height Limited, 44 B,C,D Gerrard Road, Ikoyi. Permission under the provisions of the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2010 Physical Development Regulations to erect a residential 15 floors building at 44 B, C, D Gerrard Road, Ikoyi (West).\"\n\nIt further said, \"(a) The Planning Permit granted shall become invalid where development has (2) years of the grant of such permit unless the permit is revalidated by the Authority.\n\n\u201c(b) Every developer shall, on the procurement of his permit proceed to Lagos State Building Control Agency, to give notice of his or her intention to commence Development at Oba Akinjobi Way, Old Secretariat, GRA, Ikeja.\n\n\u201c(c) The Subject site shall be clearly demarcated in accordance with the site plan and be made ready for Development. (d) The developer must complete Form C at all stages of construction and submit the same to Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA).\n\n\u201c(e) Non Compliance with the approved planning permit as designed will void the permit, and the development will be regarded as illegal.\n\n\u201c(f) The Developer shall engage the services of relevant registered professionals in the construction and supervision of the building, and submit the particulars of the professionals to LABSCA. (g) A developer of any building above two (2) floors shall insure his/her liability in respect of construction risks and submit a Certified True Copy (C.T.C) of such Insurance Policy Certification with his/her Development Permit to LASBCA\n\n\u201c(h) The owner of the building shall not occupy or permit same to be occupied before obtaining a certificate of fitness for habitation from Lagos State Building Control Agency stating that the building is fit for human habitation.\n\n\u201c(1) Other conditions (please see attached document).\n\n\u201cFailure to comply with any of the above conditions shall attract necessary sanctions on the building in line with the provisions of the extant law.\u201d",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash valued at $2 billion after investment from world\u2019s most valuable crypto exchange",
          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re discussing today:\n\nMallforAfrica closes shop\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\nViolence against journalists\n\nMallforAfrica closes shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@rupixen?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>rupixen.com</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/ecommerce?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nThere are indications that MallforAfrica, an Africa-focused eCommerce startup, has closed shop on the continent.\n\nFollowing a series of complaints by customers, our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, did some digging to discover the company\u2019s current state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you remember Africans not being able to shop on global eCommerce platforms? And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

          "title": "Collapsed building: Experts\u2019 views",
          "text": "As rescue operations continue with more survivors and dead bodies being pulled out from the rubbles of the collapsed 21-storey building in Ikoyi, Lagos, experts have faulted Lagos State government on regulatory compliance in the state\u2019s building sector.\n\nThe experts described the otherwise ambitious collapse building as bad construction with serious engineering issues. The pillars were too weak which explains why the building collapsed like a pack of cards with the deckings (slaps) falling on one another as if it were controlled demolition.\n\n\u201cWhat we see here is a clear case of failure on the regulatory authority and greed on the part of the developer. We learnt that this project was stopped in June this year and the site sealed; what happened that led to resumption of construction work\u201d? MKO Balogun, CEO, Global PFI, queried.\n\nDebo Adejana, chairman, Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), South West Zone, agrees, saying that as a nation, we should be burying our heads in the sand like the Ostrich as this kind of incident happening in a prime location like Ikoyi is unheard of in other climes.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened is grievious because it is not an act of God. The developer, we learnt, also practices outside the country and therefore should know the right thing to do. Why has this happened? I expect that heads will roll when the panel that is to be set up concludes its investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nUndoubtedly, the collapse of a building of this magnitude, which is the first of its kind in the history of building construction in Nigeria, comes with grave implications for the country\u2019s real estate market, especially the high-rise luxury sub-market.\n\nThough Tayo Odunsi, CEO, Northcourt Real Estate, does not see the incident affecting both supply and demand for luxury apartments in high-rise buildings, he sees a significant increase in construction risk financing going forward.\n\nRead Also: More evidence shows Ikoyi collapsed building developer flouted permit\n\n\u201cFinanciers are going to be a lot more cautious and will be asking a lot of questions on developers\u2019 antecedents before committing funds to a project. They will be making demands from the developers on issues bordering on regulatory compliance and the kind of project partners they have assembled,\u201d he said\n\nThere is, however, a positive side to the collapse, according to Odunsi, explaining that big developers who are known for their integrity and quality work delivery will now have to name their prices and people will be compelled to pay because they are sure of what they are paying for.\n\nOladipo Agida, CEO, Dradrock Real Estate, shares this view, saying that because there are fakes which are found across sectors, there also genuine developers who take the pain and commit resources to doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cFor a whole 21-storey building to collapse completely means the structural engineering was faulty. As a developer, before you start any development, you should do your soil test which determines the kind of foundation you are to do for the project,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that government approved 15-floors for the developer, but he added six more floors, That alone says it all that the building was a disaster waiting to happen because the six more floors came with additional load which the building was not prepared to carry,\u201d added.\n\nA professional builder, who did not want to be named, noted that for the building to collapse means there were no professionals on ground to supervise the construction as it progressed. The builder wondered why work had to resume on a building that was sealed and stop work order issued, yet the regulatory authority looked away.\n\n\u201cWhy was the building sealed in the first place; what was wrong that led to the stop work order; what did the developer do differently that made the government to unseal the building; who was the project supervisor from the government building control agency\u201d? the builder asked.\n\nMeanwhile, fresh facts have emerged on the collapsed building that are not only big slap on the regulatory authority, but also a dent on the integrity of the developer and the building industry in Nigeria in general and Lagos State in particular.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that since February 20,2020 to when the building collapsed on Monday, November 1, 2021, it did not have a supervising consultant as Prowess Engineering Limited, the lead consultant on the project, withdrew its services, citing lack of confidence in the project.\n\nThe company, in a letter dated February 20,2020 and signed by its managing director, Muritala Olawale, which was sighted by BusinessDay, stated that they could no longer guarantee the integrity of the building since \u201cwe do not have the concrete cube test result for each stage of the building till date.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a visit to the construction site of the collapsed building shows a phony Project Board that smacks of deceit and lack of seriousness in a very serious real estate business.\n\nThe first thing that assaults a visitor\u2019s eyes is that the client\u2019s name is abbreviated and given with a phone number. The main contractor\u2019s name is also given with a phone number which appears like same client\u2019s construction company.\n\nConcept Designer and Project Manager are not any different as they also have no name, but only a phone number. Though the name of the Structural Engineers was given, the phone number was covered and concealed , making it even more suspicious.\n\nThe Architect has no given name, just a phone number. The same way, the Mechanical Engineers have no given name, just a phone number.\n\nInformation given on this Project Board makes it look as if there were just two distinct personnel on this project and these were the client who was the same owner of the construction company and the Structural Engineer. All these have subjected activities on the building to various interpretations.\n\nThe collapsed building, standing on 21 floors on Gerard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, was being developed by Fourscore Homes Limited which is owned by Olufemi Adegoke Osibona, who is said to be an international real estate developer with footprints in London and South Africa.\n\nThe building would have offered homes to 42 families since each floor comprised two apartments of 3-bedroom each. Given an average of five persons per family, the building would have been home to about 210 persons.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s central bank will come under pressure in coming months to increase interest rates as central banks in developed economies adjust to life after the worst of COVID-19 by raising rates to levels before the pandemic.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve, the equivalent of the central bank of the United States, laid out a plan Wednesday to slow their bond buying programme, their first major step toward withdrawing monetary policy support.\n\nThe US Fed said it would start tapering asset buys by $15 billion per month later this month, a move that would lead to higher interest rates in the US.\n\nIt confirms earlier expectations that the US would be scaling back on its pandemic-induced $120 billion monthly asset purchase programme amid uncertainty over persistent inflationary pressures.\n\nOther global central banks are also likely to start cutting back on enormous pandemic-related stimulus programmes that caused interest rates to fall last year, as they supported their economies in the face of one of the sharpest contractions in history.\n\nRead Also: CBN holds interest rate for 6th straight time as inflation concerns weigh\n\nThe Bank of Canada already surprised markets last week when it ended its government bond purchase programme and moved up the time frame for when it might first raise its benchmark interest rate from its current near-zero level.\n\nSpeculation that the Bank of England could be the first major central bank to nudge up interest rates has also intensified in recent weeks after Governor Andrew Bailey warned on October 17 that the central bank \u201cwill have to act\u201d if surging prices for goods and energy push up Britons\u2019 expectations of future inflation.\n\nNigerian monetary authorities are well aware of the trend of rising global interest rates and the impact it would have on the economy.\n\nThe common theme in the statements of members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) published last week on the CBN website was that the normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies would spark a reversal in international capital flows from emerging and developing markets including Nigeria.\n\nFor investment-starved Nigeria, the MPC members were of the view that a reversal in fund flows could widen the country\u2019s recovery gap. Those fears led them to highlight the need for deliberate policies to mitigate the adverse impact of the global interest rate hike.\n\nOne of such policies could be to raise interest rates, a tactic that has been traditionally resorted to by emerging and frontier markets to enable them compete for investment inflows against developed economies.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, the CBN has reasons to balk at raising interest rates.\n\nThere is the need to support the country\u2019s recovery from two recessions in five years while the government\u2019s already high debt servicing costs means a further hike in rates would not go down well in Abuja.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s new found love for unorthodox policies also means it may resort to other ways of luring foreign capital other than raising interest rates.\n\n\u201cWhile it is logical that they raise rates in order to stay competitive for foreign inflows, Nigeria has warmed up to unorthodox policies recently and may not change rates,\u201d one economist said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s problem may however be bigger than just raising interest rates to attract foreign portfolio investors who have largely snubbed the West African country this year due to foreign exchange challenges, but the situation may get worse.\n\nFollowing the COVID-19 impact on the global economy, several countries around the world including the US, Canada, Russia, and the UK and Nigeria, among others, had embarked on rate cuts last year.\n\nNigeria cut interest rates twice last year \u2013 first in May and second in September 2020, taking the rate to 11.5 percent, the lowest since a recession in 2016.\n\nStubborn inflation is also a problem in Nigeria but the CBN has kept rates steady as it seeks to stimulate the economy.",

Seriake Dickson.\n\nAt the resumed trial, the prosecution witness, Mr Timothy Owoeye, an official of the EFCC, in his evidence, said that the Commission collaborated with several banks and regulatory agencies during its investigation.\n\nOwoeye was led in evidence by the prosecution counsel Mustapha Iko.\n\nHe told the court that the Commission acted on a Suspicious Transactions Report (STR) from the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to investigate the defendant.\n\nHe noted that the STR from the NFIU indicated that between April and Oct 2015, N73 million, $51,900 and \u00a33,800 in cash were reportedly lodged in the defendant\u2019s bank account at Guarantee Trust Bank, Yenagoa.\n\nOwoeye also said that efforts to trace the source of the funds made the EFCC to query the registration status of Kare-X Fashions and Designs Nigeria Ltd, with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).\n\nHe said that the company, which the defendant claimed to be her source for the funds, was not found in the database of the CAC.\n\nThe witness further said that the defendant later claimed that she had other sources of business supplying of granite and timber for construction which were also scrutinised.\n\nThe EFCC, however, said that the income from the defendant\u2019s timber business could not be ascertained as most of the buildings where the timber was purportedly used had been roofed and occupied.\n\nHe tendered letters from several organisations in response to EFCC\u2019s inquiry, documents from six commercial banks as evidence, but the court noted that the documents were not itemised for ease of reference.\n\nThe trial judge, Justice Isa Ndahen, adjourned the case until Nov. 4 for ruling on the admissibility of the documents tendered in evidence by the EFCC.\n\nThe EFCC had arraigned Apere and Beauty at the court on Oct. 8, for money laundering allegedly carried out in 2015 but defence counsel Andrew Arthur raised a motion of preliminary objection to Apere\u2019s arraignment.\n\nThe defence argued that Apere had earlier been tried and discharged and the discharge amounted to an acquittal, but the prosecution countered that the discharge was based on technicalities and not on merit.\n\nThe judge adjourned until Dec 15 for ruling on the motion opposing the arraignment of Apere.\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nAhead of Saturday\u2019s Anambra State governorship election, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and Secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), Evang. Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has thrown his weight behind the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Charles Soludo, noting that he is the right person to lead the state at this critical moment.\n\nUko who endorsed the former Central Bank of Nigeria governor, in a statement, Wednesday, titled: \u201cAnambra Should Get it Right,\u201d said he has the knowledge and experience, and total grasp of the issues, especially as concerns the Igbo question.\n\nHe emphasized that Anambra is the leading light, not just in the Southeast, but the entire country, and cannot therefore afford an underwhelming leadership at this time.\n\nUko said, \u201c48 hours to the Anambra gubernatorial election, it may be necessary to remind our people, especially Anambrarians, that Anambra, as the leading light in this country, must endeavour to get her acts together in order to inspire a new social and political order.\n\n\u201cEverything should be done to, manage properly, the quite avoidable and unfortunate untidy sociopolitical environment, created unconsciously by political hubris and leadership errors.\u201d\n\nUko who decried the deterioration of security ahead of the election, blamed same on the poor handling of pro Biafra agitations by the federal government, while insisting that the solution is not the meaningless buck passing and name calling the candidates are currently engaged in.\n\n\u201cThis unpleasant political climate of uncertainty, buck passing, name calling, finger pointing and muddled up cocktail of meaningless recriminations, cannot actually be divorced from the poor handling of agitation closely tied to the painful unwillingness by those in power, and for for a very long time, to genuinely address and fairly but firmly resolve the lingering Igbo question within the Nigerian project,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConsistently shying away from the inevitable truth, simply deepened the melee. Applying the wrong strategy, only worsened the mess. That is the unpalatable truth.\n\n\u201cPushing the truth under the carpet and consistently postponing the evil day, brought us to this impasse.\n\n\u201cAbsolving one\u2019s self or group, while engaging in recriminations, wouldn\u2019t help the situation now. Mistakes were made by all sides. Current fire brigade efforts, clearly aimed at only interim relief, will also not bring lasting peace. Courage must be found, to address the crisis altruistically from the root.\n\n\u201cThis is where bold and sincere leadership comes in. Our elders and political leaders have floundered for so long, almost abdicating their responsibilities, thereby compounding the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe situation shouldn\u2019t have degenerated to this shameful level, had the right and needful leadership been shown earlier than now.\u201d\n\nUko advised those insisting that there should be no election in Anambra to place the security and good of the state and the Southeast above all else, just as he warned the authorities against excessive use of force against the agitators.\n\n\u201cHaving said this, I humbly call on our aggrieved brothers, to place the security of our land, the welfare of our beleaguered citizens and the future and destiny of our people, into consideration at this delicate period. I call on the authorities to show restraint and to remember that excessive use of force, had only worsened the situation,\u201d Uko said.\n\nHe emphasized that Soludo, of the candidates, should be allowed and enabled to come in and correct the poor leadership currently tainting Anambra state.\n\n\u201cFinally, after a careful consideration of the leading candidates, and placing the inevitable reshaping of the destiny of Ndigbo at this auspicious moment in history, as guide, it is clear that Charles Chukwuma Soludo, towers heads and shoulders above other candidates,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cHe has the knowledge and experience, and total grasp of the issues, especially as concerns the Igbo question. He should be allowed and enabled to come in and correct the poor leadership currently tainting Anambra state.\n\n\u201cMoreover, I have every reason to believe that he thoroughly understands the urgency, importance and imperative of restructuring Nigeria and has advocated that publicly.\n\n\u201cI hereby ask Ndi Anambra to vote for and elect Prof Soludo on Saturday. If Anambra gets it right, Alaigbo will get it right.\n\n\u201cI conclude by sounding a note of warning to the people hounding only Presidential hopefuls from the East, Supreme court justice from the East and now entertainment and hospitality businessmen from the East, that this very persecution, suggestive of selective oppression, actually inspired the anger, frustration, bitterness and loss of faith powering and fuelling the uncontrollable agitation ravaging the land today.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no wisdom whatsoever, in towing and continuing the same trajectory that brought us here. Wisdom is profitable to direct.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

The technology will monitor attendance and performance of pupils and teachers in all classrooms, offering continual support and feedback,\u201d AbdulRazaq said at the signing of the MoU with the government\u2019s technical partners, New Globe, in Ilorin, the state capital.\n\n\u201cThis is our flagship education programme. It will transform all government primary schools using innovative technology, data-driven platforms, high-quality learning materials, effective training and ongoing coaching and support for teachers and school leaders.\n\n\u201cOur technical partners \u2014 NewGlobe \u2014 are trusted to drive this programme to success. They have done it in Edo and Lagos, and we trust them to do a lot more to partner with other stakeholders towards returning basic education to the dream of our founding fathers.\n\n\u201cKwaraLEARN represents our vision for a stronger Kwara. It is set to deliver dramatic improvements in learning outcomes for public school children across the state. It will accelerate the numeracy and literacy skills of our pupils, enabling them to compete with their peers anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cThis is because we believe that the path to prosperity is through the education of the Kwara child. Education underpins economic growth, stability, and sustainable development. Kwara Learn will deploy 21st century technology to support teachers and schools. It will enable our children to fulfil their potentials and offer them and the state a brighter future. KwaraLEARN will empower our teachers to become highly skilled through training and motivation to succeed at their job.\n\n\u201cTechnology is the future. I urge the people of our state, especially our education stakeholders, to support this great initiative. It is the best investment we can make in the future of the Kwara child,\u201d Governor AbdulRazaq stated.\n\nFor her part, Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Hajiya Sa\u2019adatu Modibbo-Kawu, said: \u201cThis is a thoughtful and innovative idea of the present administration to change the teaching method to a modern 21st century digital learning in Kwara. The introduction of the new technology to the schools will definitely complement the earlier investments in infrastructural development in our schools, the transparent and competitive recruitment of exceptional teachers to our classrooms and training and retraining of teachers.\n\n\u201cThe service provider will carry out intensive training of the teachers who are the end users of the devices and would support continuous monitoring of the exercise for a period of four years. Meanwhile, the whole exercise will not attract any cost to the teachers and will also provide employment opportunity for Kwarans.\u201d\n\nChairman, Kwara State Universal Basic Education Board (KWSUBEB), Prof Shehu Adaramaja, said the vision of the government was to improve primary school outcomes through KwaraLEARN by transforming learning in all classrooms and ensuring every child has access to high-quality and well-supported teachers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDirector of Policy and Partnership, New Globe, Dr Wuraola Kumbi, commended the vision of Governor AbdulRazaq for the education sector in the state.\n\n\u201cI sincerely like to commend and celebrate His Excellency for his vision in the education sector. We have followed closely all the laudable projects in accessing UBEC funds for infrastructural development and teachers training, the passage and signing into law of Education Trust Bill, the education summit and so many things to put Kwara education on the map of not only in Nigeria but across the world,\u201d she stated.",

          "title": "Vice President Osinbajo Linked To Lagos Collapsed Building With Current Death Toll Of 36 Persons",
          "text": "The collapsed unfinished 21-story building in Lagos State has been linked to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nOn Monday, a building on Gerrard Road in Ikoyi, Lagos, collapsed, trapping an undetermined number of people behind the wreckage.\n\nSaharaReporters had previously reported on Thursday that 36 people had been confirmed deceased at the collapsed 21-story structure.\n\nNine people were rescued alive from the rubble of the collapsed building by rescue and emergency workers.\n\nThere were eight males and one female among the survivors, whereas there were three females and 33 males among the deceased.\n\nSeveral sources told SaharaReporters on Tuesday that Osinbajo purchased the landed property from Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, the founder of Elizade Motors (Elizade Nigeria Limited), shortly after assuming office as Vice President.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo is linked to the property, that house that collapsed on Monday in Lagos State. I was aware when he got the landed property from Elizade. A woman was selling food at the place before, that was where all workers and labourers working around here do eat,\u201d a facility manager told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe Vice President has a lot of properties in the area, he is using his brother to manage the properties. The developer, Femi Osibona is only fronting for him. Osinbajo even bought another property for his brother in the area, it\u2019s at Mosley Street. The brother is the one managing it personally, he comes there almost every time.\n\n\u201cIf the Lagos State Government is serious, they should tell us who owns the land.\u201d\n\nThe developer\u2019s brother, Lanre Osibona was Senior Special Assistant to the President on ICT from May 2015 to December 2019.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, another source said, \u201cI know the land was bought by the Vice President from Elizade. I can\u2019t really say maybe he sold it to Osibona. I know when the land was bought. That\u2019s where we do eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he owns the land, what are you expecting, so you expect a whole Vice President to put his name in such project. He can never put his name, Femi Osibona, Fourscore Managing Director is only a front in this project. The Vice President wanted the project to finish before 2023,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\nA staff member of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) told SaharaReporters that there \u2018was an order from above\u2019 not to visit the building during monitoring.\n\nHe wondered why the General Manager of the agency, Gbolahan Oki, was suspended and the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako not punished.\n\n\u201cWhy the GM? The man that just assumed office, what about the commissioner that passes through the road everyday on his paper tiger monitoring? Let the governor suspend him and his PS as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know the building is owned by a top government official, the man in question, Osibona was only fronting for that government official. We received an order from above to stop going to the site during monitoring. I heard the Vice President intervened when the project was sealed off early in the year but I can\u2019t say maybe he is the owner. Don\u2019t forget they are both from Ikenne in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nAccording to Highbrow Living Magazine, the collapsed property, comprising four-bedroom maisonettes, flats, duplex and penthouses, was 65 percent sold out.\n\nThe price range for the apartment is also said to be between $1.2 million and $5 million.\n\n\u201cThe 20-floor strictly residential facility is the brain works of Fourscore Homes, evolving from a desire to build an original masterpiece. The concept is to have service flats in the three towers for residents to experience a stress-free lifestyle, complete with a hotel flair with a 360-degree view of Lagos state,\u201d the magazine reads.\n\nThe structure was said to be 80 percent completed and was billed to be concluded in 2022.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Osibona had said the project was supposed to be the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis development will give peace of mind and comfort to the residents, because everything works,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cWe have exhibited our expertise in property development in the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States of America and Nigeria. Fourscore Homes possesses uncommon capabilities in redefining property development in any market we choose to play in.\n\n\u201cI was one of the people whose real estate developments led to the growth of East London. I bought a house on New Cross Road and renovated it. I also bought a piece of land behind it and built two flats there, and that is what I will call my first real estate project. That was how I started building houses for sale.\u201d\n\nDespite initial denial, SaharaReporters gathered that the Lagos State Government only approved the construction of 15 storeys for the collapsed building.\n\nThere have been controversies over the actual structure approved for construction after the building collapsed on Monday, leaving at least 22 people dead.\n\nOn Monday, Oki, the suspended general manager of LASBCA had claimed that the government approved 15 floors for the 21-storey building.\n\n\u201cHe got approval for a 15-storey building and he exceeded his limit. I am on the ground here and the materials he used are so inferior and terrible,\u201d Oki had said.\n\nBut addressing journalists at the site of the collapsed building on Tuesday, Obafemi Hamzat, the Deputy Governor, said the owner of the building got approval for 21 floors.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThis particular one was approved for 21 floors, not 15. If you count, the second building was 14 or 15. The approval was done about three years ago, it is not something new, it is the construction that failed apparently from what we can see.\u201d\n\nHamzat also confirmed the earlier sealing of the building by the state government over poor construction.\n\nHe had added: \u201cIt was sealed from June. It was sealed because the agency came in to do a structural test, they saw some abnormalities, so they shut it down for those things to be corrected.\n\n\u201cThey were taking corrective actions when this (collapse) happened.\u201d\n\nIn a document, obtained by SaharaReporters, however, it was revealed that only 15 floors were actually approved for the project.\n\nThe Development Permit, dated April 2019, was approved by the Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) on 09/04/2019.\n\nIt reads partly, \u201cFor Fourscore Height Limited, 44 B,C,D Gerrard Road, Ikoyi. Permission under the provisions of the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2010 Physical Development Regulations to erect a residential 15 floors building at 44 B, C, D Gerrard Road, Ikoyi (West).\u201d\n\nIt further said, \u201c(a) The Planning Permit granted shall become invalid where development has (2) years of the grant of such permit unless the permit is revalidated by the Authority.\n\n\u201c(b) Every developer shall, on the procurement of his permit proceed to Lagos State Building Control Agency, to give notice of his or her intention to commence Development at Oba Akinjobi Way, Old Secretariat, GRA, Ikeja.\n\n\u201c(c) The Subject site shall be clearly demarcated in accordance with the site plan and be made ready for Development. (d) The developer must complete Form C at all stages of construction and submit the same to Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA).\n\n\u201c(e) Non Compliance with the approved planning permit as designed will void the permit, and the development will be regarded as illegal.\n\n\u201c(f) The Developer shall engage the services of relevant registered professionals in the construction and supervision of the building, and submit the particulars of the professionals to LABSCA. (g) A developer of any building above two (2) floors shall insure his/her liability in respect of construction risks and submit a Certified True Copy (C.T.C) of such Insurance Policy Certification with his/her Development Permit to LASBCA\n\n\u201c(h) The owner of the building shall not occupy or permit same to be occupied before obtaining a certificate of fitness for habitation from Lagos State Building Control Agency stating that the building is fit for human habitation.\n\n\u201c(1) Other conditions (please see attached document).\n\n\u201cFailure to comply with any of the above conditions shall attract necessary sanctions on the building in line with the provisions of the extant law.\u201d",

His success is for Nigerians. Whoever is wishing him to fail is wishing Nigeria to fail.\u201d\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s regime has been heavily criticised for failing to curb worsening insecurity, corruption and revamp the country\u2019s economy.\n\nA recent publication by The Economist had highlighted Mr Buhari\u2019s incompetence as president of the most populous black nation.\n\n\u201cWhen violence erupts, the government does nothing or cracks heads almost indiscriminately,\u201d the London publication had said. It also stated that Mr Buhari has failed in his promise of curbing corruption and breeds resentment.\n\nHis media aide Garba Shehu had also admitted that insecurity has become rampant under the Buhari regime.\n\n\u201cThe Economist is also accurate to state that they (insecurity challenges) have come to a head under President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration,\u201d Mr Shehu said in a statement reacting to the report.",

          "title": "NEF to FG: Declare bandits terrorists, tackle IPOB for hitch-free Anambra poll",
          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has urged the federal government to do everything within its powers to combat banditry, kidnapping and all forms of insecurity in the North-east and other parts of the country, \u201ceven if it means labelling bandits as terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe Forum made the position known in a statement issued Wednesday in Abuja at the end of its meeting under the leadership of its Convener, Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nThe meeting, it said, undertook a sweeping survey of recent developments in the country, and resolved to intervene to save Nigeria from further devastation.\n\nThe statement was signed by NEF\u2019s Director Publicity and Advocacy Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nThe Forum said formation of a political force to counter the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had become imperative to give Nigerians options outside of the dominant political parties, adding that many politicians were benefiting from the insecurity bedevilling the country.\n\nNEF said: \u201cThe Forum took note of the worsening security situation in the country, in spite of claims by the administration to the contrary. Boko Haram insurgency continues to be a major threat in the North East, while kidnapping and large scale banditry in many other parts of the North are taking over lives of large portions of the population. IPOB threatens to eradicate the influence of legitimate authority in the South East. Politicians and influential people are worsening the nation\u2019s fault lines by the manner they seek political advantages through the exploitation of threats to our unity and peaceful co-existence. Poverty and poor governance are fuelling widespread alienation from mainstream social existence.\n\n\u201cThe Forum joins the nation in its outrage over the fact that Maiduguri, Borno State capital has been without power from the national grid for ten months, and is alarmed by signs that its population could be forced to resign to living with this additional assault on their lives and livelihood. This situation must be reversed at all cost. The planned closure of Internally-Dispersed Persons (IDP) camps should be carefully considered so that it does not place more victims in avoidable peril.\n\n\u201cThe Forum regrets that arguments over labelling bandits as terrorists waste attention and energy. If labelling bandits as terrorists will substantially improve the capacity of the Nigerian state to eliminate this expanding scourge, the Forum supports it without reservation. In any case, all lawful options in bringing this menace to an end must be pursued.\n\n\u201cMeasures put in place to contain its spread should be diligently monitored and evaluated, and those that merely worsen the condition of living of law-abiding population should be removed. Governments should be sensitive to the possibility of severe food shortage in the next few months in many Northern communities, in addition to escalating cost of living, which will combine to confront the poor with intolerable conditions of living.\u201d\n\nIPOB\n\nOn IPOB, Baba-Ahmed said: \u201cActivities of the outlawed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) represent an unacceptable threat to security and rights of fellow Nigerians in the states of the South East region and the country as a whole. Its damage to the economy of the South East is already registered as a major disaster. IPOB\u2019s plans to frustrate the Governorship election in Anambra State this weekend must be resisted. The on-going trial of its leader should proceed in accordance with the laws of the land and elites from the region, who demand that he is accorded special treatment in return for peace, should know that they are merely inviting more threats on the people they should help to protect.\u201d\n\n2023\n\nOn the 2023 general elections, the \u201cForum notes that the nation is coming to terms with a major requirement of the democratic process, which is the right of all citizens to freely participate in all political activities. It is now accepted wisdom that every Nigerian can contest for any office to which he/she is qualified, and voters will choose their next leaders in credible elections.\n\n\u201cThe Forum salutes all Nigerians who toiled to restore a level playing field to our democratic system. It is now left to politicians and other leaders to conduct the type of politics that builds into it real equity, fairness, competence and justice, through inclusive campaigns and responsible approach towards the 2023 elections. The people of the North want to work with other Nigerians to produce a competent and committed Nigerian leadership that will restore confidence in our country\u2019s capacity to survive and rebuild itself for the next generations.\u201d\n\nAdvocates more options\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that PDP and APC dominate the political landscape. It further notes that Nigerians will benefit from additional options, both to improve competition and to broaden the leadership selection process. The Forum looks forward to the emergence and consolidation of other parties in the political environment. The continued existence of State electoral commissions which conduct elections into Local Government Councils is severely damaging the democratic process. The Forum advises that the on-going constitutional amendments should include the scrapping of these commissions and the assumption of their duties by INEC.\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that opportunities exist for Nigerians to register to vote in the 2023 elections. Apathy, anger and frustrations arising from failure of elected leaders to improve lives of citizens and insecurity are keeping many Nigerians from their rights and obligations to register and vote. The Forum urges especially Northerners to register and prepare to vote for new and more competent and honest leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d the statement added.\n\nUS threatens visa ban\n\nIn a related development, the United States said it was paying close attention to actions of individuals who interfere with the democratic process or instigate violence against civilian populations before, during, or after the November 6 governorship election in Anambra state.\n\nIn a statement by the US Mission Wednesday, the American government said: \u201cThe United States looks forward to a gubernatorial election in Anambra state on November 6 that is peaceful and transparent, with results that accurately reflect the will of the state\u2019s residents.\n\n\u201cWe will be paying close attention to actions of individuals who interfere with the democratic process or instigate violence against civilian populations before, during, or after the elections.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to consider consequences, including visa restrictions for those found to be responsible for election-related violence or undermining the democratic process.\n\n\u201cUnder U.S. immigration law, certain violations also may lead to restrictions on family members.\n\n\u201cWe call on citizens, electoral officials, party members, and security force personnel to do their part in ensuring a credible and secure electoral process.\u201d",

          "title": "INEC test-runs BVAS voting device in Anambra, customises election materials by LGAs, PUs",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has contacted the voters yet to collect their permanent voters card (PVC) by text messages and e-mail addresses informing them of the exact locations to collect their cards.\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu stated this Wednesday at the stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Awka.\n\nHe said the commission had through the media, sensitised electorate to the availability of the cards for collection, adding that many had already done so, while appealing to those yet to comply to do so.\n\nYakubu reminded \u201cpolitical parties, candidates and their supporters that vote-buying is illegal under our laws, just like the ban on the use of smart phone or other photographic devices in the voting cubicles is still in force.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cthe anti-graft agencies, who are members of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES), will deploy their personnel to arrest and prosecute violators.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Saturday 6th November 2021, Anambra state will make history as the first governorship election in Nigeria in which the commission will deploy the Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) device,\u201d the INEC boss said, adding \u201cthis new device replaces the Smart Card Reader (SCR) used in previous elections since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS has the dual capacity for fingerprint and facial authentication of voters. This is to guard against voting by identity theft where one person uses another person\u2019s Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to vote using the incident form.\n\n\u201cWith this development, the use of the incident form is abolished. No voter without genuine PVC will vote. No voter who has not been successfully accredited electronically using the BVAS will vote,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe BVAS is also equipped with a camera. Therefore, it has the capacity to snap Polling Unit level result and upload same to the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal so that citizens can view results as election is concluded in each polling unit.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman further stated that \u201cthere is no need for the Z-Pad since its functions have been embedded in the BVAS. I am glad to report that all the BVAS required for the election on Saturday have been configured and delivered to Anambra state.\u201d\n\nHe also told stakeholders that \u201celection duty staff have also been trained on the use of the device and we have sufficient technical staff to respond to any glitches that may occur.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Anambra state governorship election holds in the next three days. As far as INEC is concerned, there are two activities left in our Timetable and Schedule of Activities. The first one is the end of campaign by political parties which is at midnight tomorrow Thursday 4th November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe second is the election day which is Saturday 6th November 2021. These two activities will conclude the 14 items listed in the Timetable for the election released by the commission about 11 months ago on 19th January 2021. INEC has diligently implemented every activity on schedule.\n\n\u201cThe Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) for Anambra state has just briefed us on our detailed preparations for the election, including logistics and the recruitment, training and deployment of election duty staff. Non-sensitive materials have been delivered to the 21 Local Government Areas of the state.\n\n\u201cThe sensitive materials are secure in the branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) here in Awka. As is always the case on the eve of major elections, INEC will invite political parties, civil society organisations and the media to the CBN tomorrow Thursday 4th November 2021 to inspect the sensitive materials and to witness their movement to the various Local Government Areas under security escort.\n\n\u201cBy the same arrangement, the materials will be delivered to the Registration Areas or wards on Friday 5th November 2021 to facilitate the opening of polling units at 8.30am on Election Day i.e. Saturday 6th November 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure all voters in Anambra State that in designing the sensitive materials for the election, the Commission has introduced additional visible and invisible security features, including different colour codes.\n\n\u201cMaterials have also been customised by Local Government Areas and Polling Units. Let me therefore warn those who may attempt to compromise the process that we have put in place sufficient safeguards to detect counterfeits.\n\n\u201cWe are also determined to prosecute perpetrators of electoral malpractice, including any election duty staff found to be complicit. The choice of the next Governor of Anambra State is in the hands of the eligible voters and their will must prevail.\n\n\u201cThe commission is also aware of the concern expressed about the availability of PVCs for new registrants in Anambra State. At the end of the recent Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, a total of 138,802 citizens completed the registration. After cleaning up the data, the Commission identified and archived 62,698 multiple registrants.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the number of valid registrants is 76,104. This figure has been added to 5,674 requests for transfer, update of voter information and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs, bringing the total of valid registrations to 81,774. I am glad to report that the PVCs have been printed and delivered to all the Local Government Areas for collection by voters.\n\n\u201cWe have also contacted the voters by text messages and e-mail addresses and informed them of the exact locations to collect their cards. Through the media, we have also been sensitizing them to the availability of the cards for collection. Many of them have done so already. Let me therefore once again appeal to those that have not done so that their cards are available for collection.\n\n\u201cAnother issue that I need to address is the distribution of voters by polling units in Anambra state. About four weeks ago, the Commission published the register of voters for the election on 7th October 2021 i.e. 30 days to the election as required by law. Each of the 18 political parties was given a soft copy of the register here in Awka.\n\n\u201cIn addition to meeting the requirement of the law, the presentation of the register is significant for another reason. The Anambra governorship election is the first time that voting is taking place in polling units since the recent successful conversion of voting points arising from the expansion of voter access to polling units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn additional 1,112 polling units were established in Anambra state in addition to the existing 4,608 locations. This brings the total number of polling units in the State to 5,720.\n\n\u201cVoters were encouraged to seize the opportunity of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to transfer to the new polling units most convenient for them. Many did not do so. This can be partly attributed to the security situation in the State which has affected the Commission\u2019s pre-election outdoor activities, including voter education and sensitisation. Understandably, the voters have also been cautious.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the Commission did not use its powers under Section 42 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) to allot voters to the new polling units to minimise the disruptions that may occur from such a decision in view of the forthcoming Governorship election.\n\n\u201cConsequently, out of the 5,720 polling units in Anambra State, 86 (1.5%) have no voters. Consequently, the Commission will not be deploying personnel and materials to these polling units.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 894 (15.6%) of the polling units have between 1 and 49 voters. Election will hold in these polling units. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that all polling units have voters allotted to them ahead of the 2023 General election.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in our avowed commitment to transparency, the Commission has compiled a comprehensive list of all the polling units without voters as well as those having under 50 registered voters. Last week in Abuja, we had a special consultative meeting with the leadership of all political parties in and shared with them copies of the comprehensive locations of these polling units.\n\n\u201cWe appealed to them to quickly inform their branches in Anambra state as well as their candidates for the election. I would like to seize this opportunity to draw the attention of political parties, candidates and other stakeholders to this situation. Copies of the list have been distributed to all stakeholders at this meeting. Already, the same document has been uploaded to our website and social media platforms for public information.\n\n\u201cOn this note, let me reassure all stakeholders of the commission\u2019s commitment to inclusivity. In line with our policy for equal opportunity for all Nigerians to participate, the Commission introduced assistive devices for Persons With Disability (PWDs) during elections.\n\n\u201cThis includes the Braille Ballot Guide and magnifying glasses at polling units for the visually impaired as well as voter education posters for the hearing-impaired. I am glad to report that the Braille Ballot Guide and magnifying glasses will be deployed in the election this Saturday.\n\n\u201cI wish to reassure you that INEC will remain an equal opportunity commission for all Nigerians irrespective of disability. As an affirmation of this commitment, data on disability is being collected in the ongoing CVR to enable us to serve this category of voters better.\n\n\u201cI call on the leaders of political parties and candidates to continue to appeal to your supporters to eschew hate speech or disruptive behaviour before, during and after the election. Doing so will only further compound the current situation and scare voters away from exercising their rights as citizens. Working with the security agencies, we have put so much in place for the successful conduct of this election.\n\n\u201cLet us by our words and action support the peaceful and credible conclusion of the 2021 Anambra state governorship election,\u201d the commission\u2019s chairman pleaded.\n\n",

Hon. Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon. Ayuba Abok held sway as Speaker.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers decided to impeach their leader based on reasons best known to them and elected Hon. Yakubu Sanda as new Speaker, which we consider as democracy in action, hence, peace should be allowed to reign at all cost,\u201d the convener stressed.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cthe embattled Speaker had once refused confirmation of nominees as commissioners when he has opportunity to do so for the state to move forward, yet the governor who was an ex-lawmaker played along given that in democracy, each arms were at liberty to take decision on their own.\u201d\n\nThe group further bemoaned the ex-Speaker\u2019s recalcitrance in cooperating with the All Progressives Congress, APC structure in Plateau which has degenerated to factionalization during the recent state congress.\n\nIt, however, commended Governor Lalong for his maturity and leadership that has ensured peace and tranquility as well as socio-economic and infrastructural development of the state, while calling on the citizens, particularly the youths not to allow themselves to be used.",

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

          "text": "Ethiopian lawmakers on Thursday endorsed a state of emergency after rebels advanced on the capital, sparking a US warning that an aid crisis that has already plunged hundreds of thousands into hunger could worsen further.\n\nA year to the day since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed deployed troops in the northernmost region of Tigray, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) rebel fighters are now just a few hundred kilometres from Addis Ababa.\n\nAbiy\u2019s government has been locked in a war for the past year with the TPLF, which dominated national politics before he took office in 2018.\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Peace laureate promised a swift victory, but by late June the rebels had retaken most of Tigray and expanded into the neighbouring regions of Afar and Amhara.\n\nThe TPLF announced late Wednesday it had reached the town of Kemissie in Ethiopia\u2019s Amhara region, some 325 kilometres (200 miles) northeast of the capital.\n\nSpokesman Getachew Reda said the TPLF was working in the area alongside the Oromo Liberation Army rebel group, which on Wednesday predicted Addis Ababa could fall in a matter of weeks.\n\nBut a senior official from Washington\u2019s humanitarian arm USAID warned of grave repercussions for Ethiopia\u2019s already acute aid problems.\n\n\u201cWe can only assume that any march towards Addis would spread increased displacement, increased need and increased suffering for the Ethiopian people,\u201d the official told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt would certainly increase the need for humanitarian assistance while also complicating the ability to provide that assistance.\u201d\n\nThe US has called on all parties to cease hostilities, and its top envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, was due to arrive in Addis Ababa Thursday for two days of talks promoting peace and dialogue.\n\nOn Tuesday Abiy\u2019s cabinet announced a six-month state of emergency that would allow authorities to conscript \u201cany military age citizen who has weapons\u201d and suspend media outlets accused of supporting the TPLF.\n\nLawmakers formally approved the measure Thursday, state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate reported.\n\nThe US embassy also announced Thursday it was authorising the voluntary departure of most staff and their families, although no one is obligated to leave.\n\n\u201cTravel to Ethiopia is unsafe at this time due to the ongoing armed conflict. Incidents of civil unrest and ethnic violence may occur without warning,\u201d said an advisory posted on the embassy\u2019s website.\n\nFacebook deletes Abiy post\n\nWashington has been among the most vocal critics of Ethiopia\u2019s conduct of the year-long war in the country\u2019s north.\n\nBut despite repeated calls for an end to violence, militant rhetoric has persisted from both sides.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, said Wednesday it deleted a post by Abiy dated Sunday that called for Ethiopians to \u201cbury\u201d the TPLF.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the post was removed \u201cfor violating our policies against inciting and supporting violence\u201d.\n\nBut in a separate post Wednesday that remains online, Abiy vowed \u201cto bury this enemy with our blood and bones and uplift Ethiopia\u2019s dignity\u201d.\n\nIn September the US State Department condemned a speech by a prominent Abiy adviser which compared Tigrayan rebels to the Devil and said they should be \u201cthe last of their kind\u201d.\n\n\u2018Egregious humanitarian obstruction\u2019\n\nEthiopia\u2019s war has killed thousands and driven hundreds of thousands of people into famine-like conditions, according to UN estimates.\n\nThe East African bloc IGAD on Thursday joined international calls for a ceasefire, urging the warring parties to \u201cresolve their differences\u201d.\n\nAs fighting rages in Amhara and Afar, conditions in Tigray have deteriorated.\n\nThe region has been under a de facto humanitarian blockade since July, according to the UN, exacerbating fears of widespread famine.\n\nAbiy\u2019s government has blamed access restrictions on TPLF advances into neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions.\n\nBut on Thursday the US official accused Ethiopia of deliberate obstruction.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see perhaps the most egregious humanitarian obstruction in the world affecting Tigray,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cPractically no fuel, cash, medicine or medical supplies have entered in months, forcing humanitarians to scale back or halt their programmes completely.\u201d\n\nThe official noted that no supplies at all have reached Tigray for the last two weeks, and that needs were also growing in Amhara and Afar.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s External Reserves Hit $41.83bn in October But Sustainability Concerns Remain",
          "text": "As of October 29, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s external reserves have risen to $41. 83 billion compared with $33.40 billion recorded on July 30, 2021, data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed.\n\nThe accretion in external reserves followed the issuance of $4 billion Eurobond by the Federal Government and the receipt of the $3.5 billion Special Drawing Right (SDR) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on August 28, 2021\n\nHowever, the sustainability of this accretion has become a concern among analysts and stakeholders.\n\nAccording to a professor at the Department of Banking and Finance, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, the current level of imports, especially fuel imports, and the pressure in the forex market which is yet to abate, the accretion to reserves does not appear sustainable especially against the backdrop of the fact that strong oil prices require a corresponding increase in crude oil production to make any significant impact on foreign reserves.\n\nHe admitted that the surge in external reserves was due to the recent Eurobonds issuance the country made.\n\nData from the CBN, according to FBNQuest show that gross official reserves rose by USD5bn (13.7% m/m), to hit USD41.8bn last month, its highest point since October 2019. This is its sixth consecutive month-on-month increase.\n\n\u201cFor a more accurate picture, we must adjust this gross figure for the pipeline of delayed external payments,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest said in a report.\n\nTotal reserves at the end of October covered 10 months\u2019 merchandise imports on the basis of the balance of payments for the 12 months to March 2021, and 7.7 months when we add services. This is a healthy buffer,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nMohamed Abu Basha, head of macroeconomy \u2013 EFG Hermes, had predicted that Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves would cross the USD40bn mark after reserves were boosted in August with the USD3.3bn SDR allocation, providing a significant liquidity lift to the country\u2019s foreign reserve position.\n\nDoyin Salami, Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee on the Economy noted in his October presentation that \u201cWeaker foreign investment inflows, high demand for foreign currency to finance imports and other needs and possible clearance of FX backlogs are factors that continue to weaken external reserves\u201d.\n\nA report by the FBNQuest noted that U.S Fed is set to taper its asset purchase programme and revert to monetary policy normalisation.\n\nThis move, which will eventually be mirrored by other advanced economies, the report said would likely result in a redirection of international capital flows away from emerging markets.\n\nOil prices remain high, supported by tight supply even as demand has rebounded stronger than anticipated. In its latest commodity markets outlook, the World Bank forecasts crude oil prices to average USD70/b this year, USD74/b in 2022 due to stronger oil demand, followed by a decline to USD65/b in 2023. To fully benefit from rising oil prices, Nigeria must ramp up its production. According to OPEC data obtained from secondary sources, Nigeria\u2019s oil output (excluding condensates) was up 12 percent m/m to about.45mbpd in September.\n\n\u201cWe believe the rise in gross official reserves is very close to its peak and expect to see a decline in coming weeks as inflow into the reserves wind down and the utilisation of education, health, and business travel allowances begin to reflect,\u201d said FBNQuest.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
