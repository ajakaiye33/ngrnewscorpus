Our investigation revealed that they import leaves from 12 countries, including Senegal.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Philip Jakpor, Director of Programmes, said the tobacco industry was partnering with virtually every state government in the country.\n\n\u201cIf they are doing any thing with the government, whether CSR or otherwise, there\u2019s no way such government can hold them accountable,\u201d Jakpor said.\n\nRecommendations\n\nCAPPA made some recommendations to the governments towards checkmating the industry\u2019s interference.\n\nThe CSO asked for full implementation of the Act (2015) and Regulation(2019), and publication of dealings, interactions, economic incentives and benefits the industry receives from government.\n\nAlso, non-binding agreements with the tobacco industry must be rejected as governments are often at a disadvantage.\n\nFurthermore, CAPPA advocated synergy between federal and states government to institutionalise full disclosure of minutes and proceedings of meetings and interactions with the tobacco industry.\n\nAgain, the rights group said ministries, departments and agencies of government should consistently update their websites and other information platforms.\n\nThey also asked that government officials be made to sign conflict-of-interest forms periodically.\n\nAnd, CAPPA said, there\u2019s nothing normal about the tobacco industry, therefore their socially-responsible activities should be de-normalised as they are a form of tobacco promotion.\n\nThe interference index report is a 20-page publication documenting the tobacco industry\u2019s associations with governments through partnerships and CSR activities, accompanied with photographs.\n\nFor example, a two-day policy programme with Standards Organisation of Nigeria, SON; distribution of certified rice seeds as part of the FADAMA scheme in Abia State, and the NYSC #farmersfortune initiative, among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The panel also looked at what energy and commodity firms and investors can do to stay ahead of the game; and how they are supporting policy or developing effective programmes; as well as what incentives can help accelerate decarbonization and a more sustainable approach in the face of a growing climate crisis.\n\n\n\nWhile responding to Seplat Energy\u2019s timeline for energy transition and how he sees this happening, Orjiako said: \u201cI think one of the biggest challenges in energy transition is the continuous discordant tunes that are being sung across the world. The recent bull market experienced in the commodities market particularly with oil and gas is due in part to the uncoordinated planning of the pace of Energy Transition. The real message is that net zero emissions does not equate to zero fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further told the teaming audience that massive withdrawal of funding for fossil fuel projects has led to a market imbalance where with every slight rise in demand comes a sharp increase in commodity prices \u201cas seen in the recent uptick in the price of coal.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that energy transition must be done in a collaborative manner where there must be a balance between net-zero /carbon neutrality and energy poverty in Africa and much of the developing world.\n\nOn whether it is possible for oil price to go towards $100 per barrel (/bbl) given the recent demand surge and the example scenario where coal plants cannot sustain demand in China for instance, he said: \u201cIt is a possibility that oil price will go beyond $100/bbl in the near term. The bull market is not isolated and oil prices will experience volatility in the long term.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the current energy transition is also driven by politics, climate activism and policies whereas in my view the energy transition should be driven by technology and innovation in a coordinated manner by all players.\n\nA more pragmatic approach, in Orjiako\u2019s opinion, will be to invest in the technologies that will drive net zero aspirations as well as engage policies and incentives to encourage carbon capture and sequestration.",

So I imagine that the 2022 budget will reflect that 50 per cent increase,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe most vibrant economies are so because they have allowed education to dictate the way forward through qualitative research, to make a difference. In Nigeria, it cannot be different.\u201d\n\nHe also noted government\u2019s recent move of teachers retirement age from 60 to 65, saying the pronouncement is one way to recognise that basic education is the foundation and encourage teachers.\n\nThe TETFund boss lauded the Federal Government for steps to professionalize teaching and introduce special allowances for teachers, among other incentives.\n\n\u201cThe retirement age of our teachers has been moved from 60 to 65. I think this is very encouraging for teachers.

A new nation would be birthed. One where like the city to which Elisha went, the land was healed and the people prospered and peace and joy prevailed.\n\n\u201cI speak these words also to our nation. Thus says the Lord I have healed this waters. From it there shall be no more death or barrenness. According to the words of Elisha which he spoke, we say the same words to our nation as well that there is an end to the crisis. There is a dawning of a new day, the birthing of a new nation. As the scripture says, weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning.\n\n\u201cThe new nation is birthed already but covered by the clouds of crisis, one crisis or the other, but I want to let us know the clouds would clear and God Almighty would take all the glory for the birthing of this new nation.\u201d\n\nGuest Speaker, Bishop David Abioye in his sermon, said faith is the life wire of Christianity and what is needed to overcome the challenges facing the country.\n\nAbioye, who is the Presiding Bishop, Living Faith Church, Goshen City, Abuja, said however the people need to turn away from evil and turn to God as faith goes with integrity.\n\nHe urged that despite everything, the nation must remain committed to the will of God.\n\nHe assured that the country will overcome its challenges through prayers.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nWith zero local refining capacity, the Federal Government is to spend around N1.35 trillion to subsidise imported petrol between October this year and June 2022, when the finance ministry said the profligate and opaque subsidy regime will officially end.\n\nAccording to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, the Federal Government spends as much as N140 to N150 billion to subsidise Premium Motor Spirit (petrol), monthly, a development opposed by the World Bank and other international lenders who have advised the government to channel such funds into other critical sectors of the economy.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the open price of petrol has risen to N256 per litre, while the retail price is pegged at N162 per litre.\n\nThis implies that the government is subsidising the product by N94 per litre.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we are to sell at the market price today at current exchange rate, we will be selling the product at about N256 to a litre. What we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation.\n\n\u201cThe difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201cAs long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of problems to face, the problem of supply and foreign exchange for the NNPC. We may not see foreign exchange cheque taking place for importation,\u201d he said at a recent television interview.\n\nUsing the higher band of N150 billion monthly subsidy payouts, it implies that the federal government has spent N1.35 trillion on petrol between January and September this year.\n\nExperts insist that the country is bleeding heavily as it borrows to make petrol cheap and have amplified calls to ditch the subsidy regime as it only benefits the rich.\n\nMore so, with the price of crude surging, analysts say the subsidy figure could exceed N1.5 trillion by the end of 2021. Added to that, the Director General of the budget office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, said the government is going to spend an additional N300 billion over the course of the year to maintain power tariffs that do not reflect the cost of producing and distributing electricity.\n\nThe World Bank reckons that hefty subsidy payments amid opaque arrangements is robbing the country of funds needed to be channeled into education, health and agriculture as they remain strong pillars of economic growth.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri, if petrol prices are not allowed to be dictated by market forces, subsidies could cost the NNPC almost N3 trillion over the next 12 months.\n\nThe NNPC has repeatedly assured Nigerians that it would maintain its current ex-depot price of petrol until the conclusion of ongoing engagement with the organised labour and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nLabour has threatened to ground the country if petrol price rises above the current level as it would worsen the woes of already distressed Nigerians.\n\nBrent crude has climbed steadily in recent weeks and currently stands at $86 a barrel. This has led to worries that subsidy payments will also rise.\n\nMeanwhile, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) has said the full deregulation of the petroleum downstream sector will save Nigeria N12 trillion in four years.\n\nPPMC\u2019s Managing Director, Mr. Isiyaku Abdullahi, spoke at the ongoing 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Petroleum Downstream Week 2021 on Wednesday in Lagos.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the conference has as its theme, \u201cNigerian Downstream Oil and Gas Sector in Transition: Getting Set.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAt $80 crude oil, 60 million litres daily consumption and N411 to a dollar foreign exchange, PMS subsidy will be N138 per litre.\n\n\u201cDaily PMS subsidy will be N8.3 billion and annual subsidy will climb to three million naira.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi said the savings made from the removal of subsidy on petrol could be channelled to other critical areas such as infrastructure, health care and education.\n\nHe noted that the removal of subsidy would make the price of petroleum products in Nigeria at par with its African neighbours and discourage smuggling.\n\nAccording to him, with the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the country is moving towards full deregulation of the downstream sector which will attract more investments.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Adeyemi Adetunji, Group Executive Director, Downstream, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), maintained that prices of petroleum products would be determined by free market under the PIA.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe PIA has provided an enabling environment to attract investment, ensure fair competition for operators and fair price for consumers and producers to ensure industry stability.\n\n\u201cThe fuel market is expanding in view of the emerging gas opportunities. Investors and existing players should seize these opportunities to create value for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) has granted the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) approval to take over the reconstruction of 21 federal roads across the country.\n\nThis is in line with Executive Order No. 007 of 2019 cited as the Companies Income Tax (Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme) Order, 2019 (\u201cEO7 of 2019\u201d or \u201cthe Scheme\u201d) signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nDangote Group was the first to take advantage of the EO7 of 2019 to fix the Obajana-Kabba road from it\u2019s income tax.\n\nThe National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) had suspended its earlier planned nationwide strike that was to hold on October 11th to give negotiations a chance, after the NNPC warned that the strike could disrupt fuel supplies.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nNUPENG had called the strike to protest against the poor state of roads in the country, saying the situation endangers the lives of drivers.\n\nBriefing State House Correspondents at the end of the council meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said it was a strategic intervention under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nHe said the selected 21 roads are 1804.6 kilometers. He said nine of them are in North Central, three in North East, two in North West, two in South East, three in South-South, and two in South West.\n\nFashola said he presented three memoranda to the Council that were approved, explaining that two of the memoranda were on road contracts.\n\nHe said the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road especially the section to Apet Central where he said had a problem with steel-reinforced drain that was discovered there.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction in order to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replaced them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved.\n\n\u201cThe second memorandum relates to the road infrastructure tax credit scheme. You recall the Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\nNine of those 21 roads are in North Central, particularly Niger State, three in the North East, two in the North West, two in the South East.\n\nHe explained that the payment for total sum for the 21 road contracts was not a one-off payment.\n\nAlso briefing, Minister of Power, Aliyu Abubakar said he presented three memos which sought approval for the award of contract for design, manufacture, supply, construction of 55 Kilometer Agu Akwa Umuchu 132 KVA double circuit transmission line and substation having two transformers two by 60 MVA at Umuchu Umuchu with two by 132 KV line bay extension at Agu Akwa for transmission company of Nigeria (TCN). This, according to the Minister, is between Anambra and Enugu State.\n\nHe said Council approved the contract in favour of Messrs Cartlark International Limited and has dollar and Naira components respectively to finance the project.\n\n\u201cThe naira component is N4,044,309,380.69 inclusive of 7.5% VAT and 7.5% contingency payable to the Central Bank of Nigeria at the prevailing exchange rate with the completion period of 34 months. This is part of the expansion and modernisation of the TCN transmission grid and council has approved that. The second one was approval for award of contract for a procurement and supply of two \u201cFail Safe\u201d 60 MVA, 132 /33KV transformers for transmission Company of Nigeria. They are protecting themselves against fire outbreak.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "\u2022Okukor stolen from ancient Kingdom in 1897 by British colonial forces\n\n\u2022Lai Mohammed commends bravery of Nigerian students in UK varsity\n\nBy Dike Onwuamaeze with agency report\n\nThe Jesus College at Cambridge University, London, has handed over to Nigeria the Okukor, a sculpture that was looted by British troops in 1897, setting a precedent expected to put pressure on other institutions to return stolen artefacts.\n\nThe handing over documents were signed yesterday during a ceremony at the college to transfer ownership of the Okukor to the Nigerian delegation.\n\nLondon-based Daily Mail reported that the sculpture of a cockerel was one of hundreds of Benin Bronzes pillaged from the Kingdom of Benin, in Nigeria.\n\nThe college\u2019s Legacy of Slavery Working Party concluded in 2019 that the cockerel \u201cbelongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on the development in a brief telephone interview with THISDAY yesterday night, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the campaign to return the stolen artefacts commenced in 2018. Mohammed said he had travelled to London to engage the Secretary of Arts and Culture over the Ife Bronze, which was stolen from the museum in Jos and was thereafter sold to an art collector in Belgium.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cThe art collector in Belgium now sent it to an auctioneer to value it for sale. But because we had reported the case to the International Organisation of Museum (IOM), Interpol, and all authorities, it was intercepted and the British government held it.\n\n\u201cSo, we asked them to return it to us. I had to travel to London to push for its return. The auctioneer then said we must pay for it and we refused. Then we also pursued the cockerel, which is the one that they are returning now.\n\n\u201cFor the cockerel, I must give credit to our young students at Cambridge University. They put up a very good fight asking for the return of the cockerel. It was these young Nigerian students that started the fight about three years ago and then we joined them, as well as several other Nigerians joined in the campaign to get it back.\u201d\n\nThe minister told THISDAY that the University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom, had also promised to return Nigeria\u2019s artefacts in its custody.\n\nHe said, \u201cBefore then, France and Mexico have returned some of our artefacts. I was in US in July and we reached an agreement that the US government would help us intercept and return to Nigeria artefacts that were stolen or smuggled out of Nigeria and hope that before the end of November, the agreement would be signed.\n\n\u201cThe National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) is also going to the US in a few weeks. The Metropolitan Museum has said it is ready to return some arts to us. So, you can see that the momentum is building. We are also negotiating with the German government for the return of 1,130 looted artefacts.\u201d\n\nMohammed faulted the insinuation in some quarters that the delayed return of the stolen objects was the result of the country\u2019s inability to make a formal request. He pointed out that the late Ekpo Eyo, who was Director General of the NCMM, had at the IOM made a formal request, which was endorsed then.\n\n\u201cSo, what I have done now is that I have written a formal letter asking for the return of all the Ife and Benin Bronzes and all other artefacts that were stolen,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cSome of these artefacts date back to 18th century. The return of artefacts is an idea whose time has come and no matter how you resist it, they must be returned.\n\n\u201cWe have also received a letter from Switzerland for dialogue to see how they can return our artefacts.\n\n\u201cWe thank Jesus College for being a trailblazer and we look forward to a similar return of our artefacts by other institutions that are in possession of them.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail noted that Okukor was among Africa\u2019s most culturally significant artefacts and the Nigerian government had for years been calling for their return.\n\n\u201cThis is the right thing to do out of respect for the unique heritage and history of this artefact,\u201d Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, Sonita Alleyne, was quoted to have said in a statement ahead of a ceremony to hand over the cockerel to a Nigerian delegation.\n\nThe college described the handover as, \u201cThe first institutional return of its kind.\u201d\n\nIt revealed that Germany had agreed to start returning Benin Bronzes held in its museums from next year, but the British Museum in London, which holds the largest and most significant collection of them, has made no such commitment.\n\nOba of Benin, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, said in a statement, \u201cWe truly hope that others will expedite the return of our artworks, which in many cases are of religious importance to us.\u201d\n\nAfter being looted, the cockerel was given to Jesus College in 1905 by the father of a student. The college announced in 2019 it would return it to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, a range of British institutions have been grappling with the cultural legacies of colonialism, particularly the issue of what to do about disputed heritage,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt disclosed that the British Museum and other European museums, along with Nigerian authorities, were involved in a Benin Dialogue Group that aimed at facilitating the construction in Benin City of a new museum to house returned bronzes.\n\nThe British Museum had spoken about \u201copportunities for sharing and displaying\u201d items from its collection in Nigeria, but had never said it would transfer ownership.\n\nThe master of a Cambridge University college described the return of a looted bronze cockerel to representatives of Nigeria as a \u201cmomentous occasion.\u201d\n\nStudents had campaigned for the artefact to be returned, and the college\u2019s Legacy of Slavery Working Party concluded in 2019, that it \u201cbelongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin\u201d.\n\nThe Oba of Benin is head of the historic Eweka dynasty of the Benin Empire based in Benin City in modern-day Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further after the handover, Alleyne said, \u201cIt\u2019s massively significant. It\u2019s a momentous occasion.\u201d\n\nShe said it was the \u201cright thing to do\u201d to return the artefact, which is of \u201ccultural and spiritual significance to the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlleyne added, \u201cIt\u2019s part of their ancestral heritage.\u201d\n\nShe said the Nigerian delegation would decide how and when to move the Okukor.\n\nAlleyne disclosed that museums in France, Germany and the Netherlands were also engaged in discussions about returning Benin bronzes.\n\n\u201cWe hope they do get to the same position as we do. We think it\u2019s a morally grounded position,\u201d she added.\n\nThe statue was removed from display at the college in 2016, and would be given to Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments at a ceremony attended by delegates from the commission and Benin.\n\nA Paris museum is displaying 26 looted colonial-era artefacts for one last time before France returns them home to Benin.\n\nThe wooden anthropomorphic statues, royal thrones and sacred altars were pilfered by the French army in the 19th century from Western Africa.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had suggested that France needed to right the wrongs of the past while making a landmark speech in 2017 in which he said he could no longer accept \u201cthat a large part of many African countries\u2019 cultural heritage lies in France\u201d.\n\nThis laid down a roadmap for the controversial return of the royal treasures taken during the era of empire and colony, a move that could have potential ramifications across European museums.\n\nThe French would have a final glimpse of the objects in the Musee du quai Branly\u2013Jacques Chirac from October 26th to 31st.\n\nFrench culture minister Roselyne Bachelot tried to assuage jitters among European museums, emphasising that this initiative \u201cwill not create a legal precedent.\u201d\n\nA French law was passed last year to allow the restitution of the statues to the Republic of Benin, as well as a storied sword to the Army Museum in Senegal.\n\nBut Bachelot said the French government\u2019s law was intentionally specific in applying solely to the 26 artefacts.\n\n\u201cIt does not establish any general right to restitution and in no way calls into question\u201d the right of French museums to hold on to their heritage.\n\nYet critics of such moves \u2013 including the British Museum, which is in a decades-long tug-of-war with the Greek government over a restitution of the Elgin Marbles \u2013 argue that it would spark a move that could empty Western museums of their treasured collections.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Lagos-Badagry Road, Bida-Minna road, dualisation of Aba-Ikot Ekpene road, others listed\n\n\u2022Deregulation to deliver N12trn savings to Nigeria in four years, says oil company\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe federal government has given the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) the green light to take over the repairs and reconstruction of 21 critical highways spread across the nation\u2019s six geo-political zones.\n\nThis is just as the NNPC has said deregulation of petroleum sector would enable the country save the N12 trillion being spent on subsidy payment in the next four years.\n\nAccording to the federal government, the 1, 804.6 kilometres-long stretch of roads which would be fixed with a total sum of N621.2 billion over a reviewable three-year period would be executed under the tax relief scheme of the present administration.\n\nThe Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who made these known to journalists yesterday, at the State House, Abuja, after the weekly virtual meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, declared that six out of the 21 roads were located in Niger State which is known to have one of the worst road networks in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the intervention by the NNPC was a strategic move under the federal government\u2019s Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nHe said nine of the benefitting road projects are in north-central, three in north-east, two in the north-west, two in the south-east, three in south-south, and two in south-west.\n\nThe minister disclosed that his ministry presented three memoranda to the Council that were approved, explaining that two of the documents were on road contracts.\n\nHe said the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road especially the section to Apet Central where he said had a problem with steel reinforced drain that was discovered there.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction in order to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replaced them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved,\u201d he added.\n\nFashola further explained that the second memorandum had to do with the road infrastructure tax credit scheme.\n\n\u201cYou recall the Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\n\u201cAlso recall that I had briefed you here about the use of that policy like the Dangote Group from Obajana to Kabba, Apapa to Oworoshoki roads\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads, the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto and couple of others and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was approved about N320 billion.\n\n\u201cSo today, we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and committed to deploy taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC. So NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. So now the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps government to achieve many things, including Ministerial Mandates Three and Four, which we discussed at the last retreat if you recall was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure, which is the Ministerial Mandate four,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cNNPC sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North Central, particularly Niger state. And the reason is that Niger State is a major storage center for NNPC. So the reason NNPC is doing this is to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen and have heard every year Niger State gridlock, the governor complaning that his roads are being damaged by trucks, by those who overload the trucks after damaging the roads themselves now protest the damage that they sometimes have induced. Anyway, this is the final solution to that problem.\n\n\u201cSo there are nine like that in north central, there are three in the Northeast. Two in the northwest, two in the southeast, three roads, the entire Odupani \u2013 Itu \u2013 Ikot Ekpene road in LOT 1, 2 and 3 now fully covered.\n\n\u201cThen in the southwest, you have the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the entire junction and you also have the Ibadan to Ilorin in Oyo-Ogbomosho section. So that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cIn the south-east you have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuano to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth. In the Northwest, it is Gada-Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau -Gusau-Sokoto road.\n\n\u201cIn the north-east, it is Cham-, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road. The roads impacted in north central include Ilorin -Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani sections I and II, Suleja-Minna sections I and II, Bida-Lambatta, and then Agaie-Katcha-Baro road. Then Mokwa-Makera-Tegina-Kaduna all in Niger State.\u201d\n\nNNPC: Deregulation to Deliver N12trn Savings to Nigeria in Four Years\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC has said the deregulation of petrol marketing business in the country would enable the country save N12 trillion subsidy payment in the next four years.\n\nThe corporation said the money could be used to carry out some critical social infrastructure projects in strategic sectors of the economy, including roads, hospitals, power generation, amongst others.\n\nManaging Director of the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), an arm of the NNPC, Mr. Isiyaku Abdulahi, stated this yesterday in Lagos during his presentation at the ongoing 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTC) Africa Downstream Week.\n\nHe spoke on the topic, \u201cNigeria Fuel Congress.\u201d\n\nIsiyaku projected that petrol under-recovery, otherwise known as subsidy, could be N138 per litre when calculated using $80 per barrel oil price, 60 million litres daily consumption and the current official exchange rate of N411 per dollar.\n\nHe added that daily petrol under-recovery could be N8.3 billion while annual petrol under-recovery could escalate to N3 trillion.\n\nNoting that the deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector as contained in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) would lead to increase investments in the sector and enhanced value to the country, Abdulahi listed some critical social infrastructure projects that could be funded with the subsidy savings.\n\nThe projects cut across roads, health, education, housing, and power.\n\nAccording to him, 7, 500 kilometres (km) of roads could be constructed every year at a cost of 400 billion per km.\n\nHe said the money could also help the country to build well equipped 120 bed tertiary health centres across the country, with 37 to be constructed every year at the cost of N82 billion per hospital.\n\nOther projects, which can be carried out with the projected subsidy savings, according to him included building and equipping 2,400 units of 1,000 bed hospitals across the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\nHe listed others to include building of 500,000 new houses for families through mortgage at N20 million per house; additional 27,000 megawatts (MW) of solar-powered electricity to the national grid; and educating and skilling up of Nigerians with global standard quality of education and sought-after skills.\n\nAlso speaking at the conference, the Group Managing Director of Swift Oil Limited, Mr. Stilian Mitakev, and the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr Muda Yusuf, knocked the federal government over its insistence to continue controlling the pricing of petrol despite the deregulation of the downstream sector by the PIA.\n\nMitakev expressed doubts about the Nigeria petroleum sector witnessing positive changes even with the creation of new agencies to replace the former ones, arguing that the same staff of the scrapped agencies were the same people to man the new ones.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the new Act, it is true that DPR, PPPRA and PEF have already been scrapped but the Commission and the Authority will be manned with the staff from the scrapped agencies.\n\n\u201cSo, they will be the same people in the new dispensation. Our only hope is that the CEOs of the two new agencies are seasoned professionals and I\u2019m sure they will still try to achieve much better results in their respective fields.\u201d\n\nHe said there was need for genuine deregulation and incentives to drive development of refining capacity in all parts of the country especially in the northern.\n\nMitakev said one of the serious impediments in the development of a truly deregulated market determined by demand and supply forces was scarcity of foreign exchange.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Despite IPOB threat, poll will hold, says commissioner\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nThe Senate has told the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that it is at liberty to transmit electronically the results of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State. Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Kabiru Gaya, said yesterday in Abuja that the electoral umpire was free to transmit the governorship election results electronically if it so desired.\n\nThis is just as Anambra State Government through its Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. Don Adinuba, has said the governorship election slated for November 6 in Anambra State would hold, despite the sit-at-home order given by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAdinuba who spoke yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said the people of Anambra State and members of the various political parties in the state were very confident that the election would hold, despite threat from IPOB members.\n\nSenator Gaya gave the green light for the electronic transmission of the result when the National Assembly Joint Committee on Electoral Matters and INEC met with stakeholders on the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nThe senate INEC committee chairman said, \u201cIt is left for INEC to decide whether it will transfer the election results in Anambra or not. They have done that in the previous elections in Edo and Ondo states.\n\n\u201cEven before INEC started transferring elections results from polling units, Nigerians have been monitoring results of elections the moment they are being announced at polling stations and by 4pm, even before the final results are announced, many Nigerians would have seen them on the Internet. Nigerians are fully involved in elections.\u201d\n\nThe ranking senator said INEC had assured the joint committee that it would go ahead with the Anambra election and declare the winner, despite the prevailing security situation in the state.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe expect the people of the state to cooperate fully with the electoral body by being law abiding. The only way to achieve free and fair, credible election in Anambra is for everybody to eschew violence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, iNEC National Chairman, Professor Yakubu Mahmood, said the agency had recovered from the series of attacks by yet to be identified persons in Anambra State.\n\nMahmood said, \u201cWe have recovered from the series of attacks on our facilities and I am happy to say that we have deployed all the non-sensitive materials to all the local government areas. We have trained the requisite number of adhoc staff for the election and we have also mobilised members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers for efficient distribution of materials on Election Day. As far as INEC is concerned, we are good to go on November 6, 2021.\u201d\n\nOn the level of distribution of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in Anambra State, he said, \u201cWe have a little over 81,000 valid registrants. After the suspension of the CVR (Continuous Voter Registration) in Anambra State, that includes a little over 5,000 that applied for replacement of cards and intra-state and inter-state transfers.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, we are batching the cards. They will leave first thing tomorrow morning for Awka and all the new registrants will get their cards before the elections.\n\n\u201cThis time around, with the help of technology, we were able to harvest the telephone numbers and email addresses of the registrants. So we will contact each and every one of them and tell them where to pick their cards. But the cards will be delivered to Awka tomorrow (Thursday).\u201d\n\nDespite IPOB Threat, Anambra Election Will Hold, Says Commissioner\n\nAnambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. Don Adinuba, has said the governorship election slated for November 6 in Anambra State would hold, despite the sit-at-home order given by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAdinuba who spoke yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said the people of Anambra State and members of the various political parties in the state were very confident that the election would hold, despite threat from IPOB members.\n\nAdinuba who expressed confidence that the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), whose gubernatorial candidate is Prof. Chukwuka Soludo, would win the election, called on the people of the state to come out in their numbers to vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\n\u201cSoludo is currently campaigning in all the 21 Local Government Areas of the state and the people have assured him of their votes. Despite the attack on his person by political thugs, Soludo is not deterred, as he still goes about campaigning with renewed strength,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\nAddressing the tensed situation in the state, which was created by the sit-at-home order by IPOB, Adinuba who dismissed the threat order, said IPOB issued the same threat order four years ago against conducting the election that year, but later rescinded its threat order after some prominent people from the South-east intervened.\n\nHe said he was confident that the same members of IPOB would also change their minds, since high level negotiations had begun to dissuade IPOB members of their current position.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, there are people who have started negotiating with IPOB members and the former Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezife, is one of them who is leading the negotiation. But beyond the political approach, the Inspector General of Police (IG), is sending 34,000 policemen, led by Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), who is an indigene of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cOther security personnel will be joining the 34,000 policemen to ensure that the election is conducted in a peaceful manner, without fear of intimidation from any group. So the Anambra political environment will be overwhelming by the presence of policemen during the election, and that will go a long way to inspire confidence in the people to come out and vote on the day of election,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\nHe expressed confidence that APGA members, including the 34 Soludo Solidarity Groups, would come out in their numbers to vote for Soludo on the day of the election.\n\n\u201cIf members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), decided not to turn out for the election, people will not be surprised because they have technically backed out of the election for fear of defeat because they have been very timid and they have not been campaigning,\u201d Adinuba further said.\n\nReacting to the recent defection of party members from APGA to other political parties in Anambra State, Adinuba said the defection would not in anyway affect the unity and strength of APGA in Anambra State. He said what happened in Zamfara and Rivers states, where APC did not present their candidates for election, would happen again in the Anambra gubernatorial election, thus raising hope that APGA will have a wide margin win over other political parties in the November gubernatorial election in Anambra State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A young man, Dada Fasoto Arifanlajogun who is said to be the witch doctor who 'spiritually fortifies' Yoruba agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho has been in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) since he was arrested three months ago in his home in Ekiti.\n\nThis was disclosed by his mother, Olomitutu Fasoto in an interview with BBC Yoruba.\n\nThe aggrieved mother said since her son was arrested three months ago by men perceived to be from the office of the DSS, no one has heard from him.\n\nShe said his whereabouts were also not known.\n\nOlomitutu said the 28-year-old, since his arrest, had yet to be charged with any crime.\n\nAccording to her, all efforts to find the young man particularly with visits to the offices of the DSS, police and other security agencies have been futile as they claimed to know nothing about his whereabouts.\n\nShe said, \"There are several indications that my son was taken away by the DSS because other security agencies do not have my son with them, and they do not know anything about where he was taken to.\"\n\nShe added that her son is a very gentle and easygoing person who practises traditional medicine with the fear of God.\n\nShe, however, expressed surprise that he could be arrested simply because he is a herbalist 'spiritually strengthening' Sunday Igboho.\n\nOlomitutu said she had consulted the gods and performed all the necessary rites as a traditionalist but everything had been in vain.\n\nShe further called on all Nigerians to help to secure the release of her son so he could return to his wife and 5-year-old son.\n\nSpeaking on Dada's disappearance, Aderonke Apalara, the sister-in-law said officers in mufti arrested Arifanlajogun.\n\nShe said the officers who were up to 10 in number were fully armed and had arrived in two white Hilux vans.\n\nApalara added that the officers arrived at the herbalist's residence at 5 pm on the 16th of July, 2021 to arrest Arifanlajogun.\n\nAderonke said, \"When the family members tried to stop the officers from arresting him, they cunningly called the police station at Okesha and told us to come for him at the station.\n\n\u201dWhen we got to the station, we were told the officers that arrested Arifanlajogun were not from Okesha station, it was there it dawned on us that the officers lied to us and all efforts to know his whereabouts for about three months now have proved abortive.\u201d\n\nThe report further quoted the Ekiti State Police spokesperson, Sunday Abutu as saying the Police Command was not aware of the incident.\n\nHe, however, advised the family to report the incident at the police station nearest to them.\n\nAlso, the DSS office in Ekiti stated that it could not comment on the issue but advised the family to reach out to the DSS office in Abuja.",

          "text": "A young man, Dada Fasoto Arifanlajogun who is said to be the witch doctor who 'spiritually fortifies' Yoruba agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho has been in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) since he was arrested three months ago in his home in Ekiti.\n\nThis was disclosed by his mother, Olomitutu Fasoto in an interview with BBC Yoruba.\n\nThe aggrieved mother said since her son was arrested three months ago by men perceived to be from the office of the DSS, no one has heard from him.\n\nShe said his whereabouts were also not known.\n\nOlomitutu said the 28-year-old, since his arrest, had yet to be charged with any crime.\n\nAccording to her, all efforts to find the young man particularly with visits to the offices of the DSS, police and other security agencies have been futile as they claimed to know nothing about his whereabouts.\n\nShe said, \"There are several indications that my son was taken away by the DSS because other security agencies do not have my son with them, and they do not know anything about where he was taken to.\"\n\nShe added that her son is a very gentle and easygoing person who practises traditional medicine with the fear of God.\n\nShe, however, expressed surprise that he could be arrested simply because he is a herbalist 'spiritually strengthening' Sunday Igboho.\n\nOlomitutu said she had consulted the gods and performed all the necessary rites as a traditionalist but everything had been in vain.\n\nShe further called on all Nigerians to help to secure the release of her son so he could return to his wife and 5-year-old son.\n\nSpeaking on Dada's disappearance, Aderonke Apalara, the sister-in-law said officers in mufti arrested Arifanlajogun.\n\nShe said the officers who were up to 10 in number were fully armed and had arrived in two white Hilux vans.\n\nApalara added that the officers arrived at the herbalist's residence at 5 pm on the 16th of July, 2021 to arrest Arifanlajogun.\n\nAderonke said, \"When the family members tried to stop the officers from arresting him, they cunningly called the police station at Okesha and told us to come for him at the station.\n\n\u201dWhen we got to the station, we were told the officers that arrested Arifanlajogun were not from Okesha station, it was there it dawned on us that the officers lied to us and all efforts to know his whereabouts for about three months now have proved abortive.\u201d\n\nThe report further quoted the Ekiti State Police spokesperson, Sunday Abutu as saying the Police Command was not aware of the incident.\n\nHe, however, advised the family to report the incident at the police station nearest to them.\n\nAlso, the DSS office in Ekiti stated that it could not comment on the issue but advised the family to reach out to the DSS office in Abuja.",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nThe eNaira project will be implemented in phases. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Vendease was founded in January 2020 by four friends: Tunde Kara (CEO), Olumide Fayankin (COO), Gatumi Aliyu (CPO) and Wale Oyepeju (CTO), to solve Africa\u2019s food supply chain problems by digitising procurement processes, storage operations and logistics, and offering flexible payment systems to help food businesses grow.\n\nThere are a lot of fragmented moving parts in running procurement for businesses in Africa, especially small food businesses. Food businesses are mostly vulnerable to substandard goods, fluctuating pricing system, expensive middlemen, wastage of productive time while restocking, and unreliable logistics.\n\nNow, instead of going through the inefficient route of restocking food materials, restaurants can click to order and get all their food supplies within 24 hours on Vendease.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBuilding Vendease\n\nBefore Vendease, the co-founders, who have been friends for over six years, had forayed into different businesses together. They had even founded an adtech company that wanted to put ad screens in public buses and ride hailing cabs, but the business didn\u2019t scale.\n\nWhile growing up, Kara, ex-CEO of RED Media and Fayankin, ex-COO at Statecraft Inc., were actively involved in small-scale trading and procurement. Kara grew up on his civil servant father\u2019s farm where they reared animals and grew crops, but the farm later folded up due to lack of access to the market.\n\nBefore leaving for university\u2014and afterwards, occasionally during the holidays\u2014Fayakin handled procurement for his family\u2019s hotel business in Akure. Though Kara would go on to do different things after school and Olumide would become a procurement expert, having these early experiences from different perspectives was key to how they were able to quickly connect the dots when they came together to start Vendease.\n\nKara, who considers himself a foodie\u2014somebody who loves to eat\u2014had a light bulb moment when a food truck that sold \u201cone of the best pork chops in the world\u201d in the Lekki area of Lagos shut down due to its inability to cope with the price instability of food materials in Nigeria. The business was running at a loss and the owner told Kara he had to shut down.\n\nVendease co-founders.\n\nKara told his friends about the closure of his best pork chops spot. They all vented and, as usual, discussed the problem for a while, asking what if they could do something to help small food businesses like this to scale. But they soon forgot about it and went on with their lives.\n\nThe eureka moment that would lead to Vandease came when Fayankin and his wife won an online couple\u2019s competition that sent them on an all-expense-paid getaway in one of the finest hotels in Lagos. While in the hotel, Fayakin overheard the manager of the hotel lamenting about the late delivery of items he had ordered for about two days. He engaged the manager and carefully registered all his troubles. He then asked the manager if he\u2019d take an alternative if he saw one. The manager said yes and that\u2019s how Vendease, which hadn\u2019t been named, got its first customer.\n\n\u201cWe stopped after the third successful errand. While running errands for this hotel, on the side, we were talking to other food business owners and learning a lot from the open market, and then we decided to build technology stacks that would help solve the problem at scale,\u201d Kara told TechCabal.\n\nThey reached out to Gatumi who was then CPO at 54gene, Africa\u2019s premier biotech company, and Oyepeju who was a serial techpreneur and has built technologies for a few global tech companies like IBM and MTN.\n\n\u201cWe put a thesis together after a couple of months and analysed what the market size was, and what our market share would be if we were to kick off then. We took our thesis to local angels in the Lagos ecosystem and they gave us our first cheque to prove the business model based on our track records,\u201d Kara said.\n\nPivoting into a more sustainable system\n\nThe initial idea was simple: enable food businesses to get their regular supply at the quality and price they wanted. So they built a marketplace to connect restaurants with manufacturers, vendors and farms. This way, restaurants could compare prices and buy according to their budget.\n\nThey entered the market with this product and, after a while, realised that they\u2019d only digitised the traditional way of procurement. Their customers\u2019 complaints on delayed fulfilment and poor quality still lurked around. So they started building proprietary tech and systems that would allow them to be active in the entire value chain, from the point of order to the point of last-mile fulfilment.\n\nSo how does a food supply operating system work?\n\nVendease doesn\u2019t just allow food businesses place orders for food supplies and track them; they can also manage inventory, track expenses and gain access to credit facilities. The startup is moving towards becoming the only partner food businesses need to scale and stay in business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAccording to Kara, the company has grown from a procurement marketplace to a full-fledged data company. In the space of 22 months of operations, the company has built a data bank that now gives near-perfect insights on how to serve their customers better.\n\n\u201cWe now have an algorithm that can predict when and what our users are going to order. So we have our trained procurement officers on standby before our customers even make their orders. We can move ahead, and this is how we\u2019ve been able to beat the 24 hours delivery time,\u201d Kara said when asked how the company fulfils a promise of 24 hours delivery in a busy environment like Lagos.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nThe startup is growing fast from a one-customer business to handling procurement for over a thousand food businesses in three Nigeria cities: Lagos, Ibadan and Abuja.\n\nBecause its algorithm was built on a tough market like Lagos, expanding and operating in Ibadan and Abuja was seamless.\n\nIn September 2021 alone, the startup said it has delivered approximately 100,000 metric tons of food and helped restaurants save approximately 5,000 man-hours in the last 9 months. This has helped the startup to hit a $12.9 million transaction volume in September.\n\nThe startup joined Y Combinator in the summer of 2020 and on Monday, October 25, it announced that it has closed a $3.2 million investment round from Global Founders Capital, Y Combinator, Hustle Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Hack VC, Soma Capital. Early backers like Tayo Oviosu of Paga, John Obaro of Remita and Magic fund also participated.\n\nSpeaking on their investment in Vendease, Don Stalter, managing partner at Global Founders Capital, said, \u201cAs a backer of one of Africa\u2019s very first unicorns, Jumia, we\u2019ve seen a great deal of talent in the market\u2014and Tunde and the Vendease team are best in class both in EMEA and globally. Their laser focus and rapid growth are unprecedented, and there\u2019s a massive opportunity ahead.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to use the fund to expand into more African cities and build more technology stacks that will position it as the operating system of food supply.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How Koa is helping Kenyans build and manage wealth",
          "text": "Despite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors attributed to this low rate: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also a problem of cumbersome saving options and lack of proper financial education that exposes people to the importance of savings.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Belgium to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delila and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform has already passed a 12,000 users mark and has received a deposit of 11,105,315.30 KES ($100,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; the lack of access to formal financial products also made it hard to invest. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: Naira\u2019s digitisation (the eNaira)\n\nA very recent accomplishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is the issuance of the new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the eNaira.\n\nThe eNaira is the digital form of the Naira issued by the CBN to complement the traditional Naira as a less costly and more efficient means of payment, geared towards fostering financial inclusion of the unbanked population.\n\nThe eNaira has been designed to operate using the two-tier model, \u2018a hybrid system\u2019, where the CBN as developer and regulator relates directly with the users, while the commercial banks, including other fintech organisations, act as intermediaries.\n\nConsequently, financial institutions have the responsibility to onboard their customers and integrate the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nAcceptance of the eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf properly harnessed, a more simplified and less costly payment system would thrive in Nigeria. The country is home to one of the world\u2019s youngest populations, with increasing smartphone penetration, and has made notable advancements in regulations to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments.\n\nCertainly, there are challenges to operating a CBDC, one of which is the possibility of deposit flight from traditional commercial banks.\n\nMeasures to combat this concern include limiting the amount of CBDC held by each consumer as already implemented by the CBN and its zero interest rate, thus disincentivising the need to have a high stock of this asset. Regulators should begin to measure the level of acceptance of this digital currency within the next few months.\n\nBeyond Financial Inclusion\n\nA CBDC Regime for Efficiency in the Flow of Foreign Remittances\n\nOne of the major benefits canvassed for the development of the CBDC is the ability to solve the present inefficiencies in the flow of foreign remittances (FR). FR flow continues to be one of the greatest sources of revenue for developing economies such as Nigeria.\n\nThe World Bank data also indicates that remittance flow to Nigeria accounted for over 40% of remittance flows to the sub-Saharan region in 2020, while remaining the most expensive region to send money to.\n\nHow can the adoption of CBDC by central banks aid in solving the inefficiencies in the flow of FR? A major priority of the G20 has been the need to enhance cross-border payments by addressing the key challenges.\n\nVarious research efforts aimed at addressing these challenges indicate that by leveraging on technological advancement, a model like the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) solution for cross border funds transfer has the potential to complete a multi-currency cross-border payment process utilising wholesale multi-CBDCs (mCBDCs) within seconds.\n\nTo achieve these gains, it is imperative to factor an international dimension into the CBDC\u2019s design. This would require multi-jurisdictional collaboration amongst central banks, which takes interoperability across jurisdictions into account when countries are designing their domestic CBDCs. It is hoped that the design model behind the eNaira can permit coordination amongst peers once mCBDCs models become operational.\n\nBoosting Intra-African Trade by Digitising Trade Finance: A case for mCBDCs\n\nBeyond the tremendous potential for efficiency in the flow of FR, mCBDCs may provide a great avenue for boosting intra-African trade through a unified payment system for cross-border trade in goods and services within the African Continental Free Trade Area (\u201cAfCFTA\u201d).\n\nThe AfCFTA, once fully operational, promises to unlock immense value and economic development for the continent. Blockchain technology is delivering great rewards, which the continent has to fully embrace to make the quantum leap in economic development, especially after the setback experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs already stated, the DLT solution for cross-border and FX funds transfer has huge potentials for simplifying cross-border payment with great savings on time and money.\n\nResearch already reveals that it can deliver advantages like payment verification decentralisation, resilient payment landscape, payment innovation through utilisation of smart contracts, cash tokenisation, data integrity, and interoperability.\n\nThese are emerging solutions to pain points currently experienced in cross-border transactions, and African entrepreneurs and SMEs will benefit greatly from such a system.\n\nThe DLT solution is not without its problems like other technological innovations, and various jurisdictions are still ironing out the kinks. However, the conversation keeps progressing and Africa through AfCFTA must not be left out of the discourse as the DLT solution promises to be one of the major avenues for eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade within the continent.\n\nAsides from Nigeria, many African countries are actively exploring and researching the issuance of CBDCs in their jurisdictions. We believe that CBDC adoption within the AfCFTA is imminent, albeit progressive.\n\nThus, the importance of early cooperation amongst member states at the design stage, or at the latest, the pilot stage, cannot be overemphasised. If this window is missed, coordination at a later stage becomes cumbersome, time-consuming, expensive, and may set the continent back decades in its economic development agenda.\n\nThe unplanned and undesirable alternative would most likely be a proliferation of largely unregulated cryptocurrencies and their variants as a means of payment across large eCommerce platforms and the likely adoption of global alternatives to money such as the stablecoins, which is already a subject of discourse.\n\nConclusion\n\nNigeria has taken another bold step towards trade finance digitisation by introducing the eNaira; however, the journey has just begun. CBDCs have great potential for unlocking the exponential economic growth of Africa.\n\nSome countries and regional economic blocs are making great strides in developing workable solutions to unlock the value in mCBDCs adoption through partnerships with organisations like the Bank for International Systems (BIS).\n\nIf Africa is to tap into the huge potential for trade liberalisation offered by the AfCFTA, it needs to take a cue from these jurisdictions and explore partnerships for research and development into mCBDCs as a veritable means for cross-border payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAderemi Fagbemi Partner, Tech & Digital Law Desk at Tope Adebayo LLP | +234 809 992 7408 | a.fagbemi@topeadebayollp.com | Website Aderemi is a Partner with Tope Adebayo LLP with almost two decades of experience in the legal profession.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY- The Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), has called on African governments and delegates to the annual United Nations (UN) climate change conference \u201cConference of the Parties\u201d (COP26) taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, from November,\n\n1-12, 2021, to be resolute in their demand for climate change liability and payments for carbon debts by rich countries.\n\nDrawing attention to COP26, a summit to be attended by countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \u2013 a treaty that came into force in 1994, ERA/FoEN\n\nin it\u2019s press statement, stated that in recent times, rich countries showed appreciable effort to address climate change with countries such as the United State of America (USA,) Germany and the United Kingdom taking the lead in renewed pledges to the UNFCCC climate fund to address mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries.\n\nERA/FoEN, nonetheless lamented that efforts by rich countries so far have grossly fallen short of expectations and unlikely to close the gap on limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nPointing to a recent UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report that warned that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 percent each year between 2020 and 2030, a report that warned that the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, Executive Director, ERA/FoEN, Dr Godwin Uyi Ojo, harped on the need for African governments and delegates to address the lack of equity and fairness in addressing climate change impacts.\n\nDr. Ojo, noted that catastrophic events which impact climate change have gone worse due to the Covid-19 pandemic, making countries especially in Africa vulnerable. He stated that given the rate of fiscal responsibility and allocations in addressing climate events in Europe and America and the robust response to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an undeniable dichotomy between the rich and poor countries that betray the lack of equity and fairness in addressing these issues in the developing countries.\n\nReiterating this point, he said,\n\n\u201cAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, climate change impact will continue to be on the rise and with growing intensity hence the need for urgency. Firstly, the pledge to mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020-2025 as funds to addressing climate change actions stands at about 30% and is nowhere near its mark. Therefore, the Earth Summit meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP26) in Glasgow should be a rallying moment for rich counties to step up their commitments and show solidarity by walking the talk and putting their money where their mouth is.\n\n\u201cSecondly, CoP26 provides the opportunity to amplify system change and a transition from carbonized economy and fossil fuels dependence to renewable energy. Developing countries should redouble their stand to demand for a fair, just, and equitable energy transition and the climate finance to address climate change. There is the need to end addiction to fossil fuels, discard the false solution of net zero, and enthrone system change in the modes of production and consumption while plugging the widening gap of social inequalities at national levels and on a global scale.\n\n\u201cCoP26 should not be a process to reinforce energy colonialism on Africa but should liberate the continent\u2019s energy potentials through cleaner technology and finance. Africa with low technology intake should not be taken advantage of or seen as a market expansion opportunism for developed countries\u2019 renewable energy sector that is out-competing to dumping of obsolete technologies and petrol/diesel combustion engines.\n\n\u201cWhile the future ban or elimination of combustion engines production and use in some European countries from 2025 onwards is commendable, it should be clear how these obsolete technologies, cars and combustion engines will be disposed of or recycled. Africa should not be the dumping ground or receptacle for such technologies that could be shipped to it as Greek gifts or forms of development aid. In the words of an activist, \u2018you cannot set fire in my house and sell fire extinguisher to me.\u2019\n\n\u201cThirdly, there is the need for African governments and delegates to demand loudly that greenhouse gas emissions is a financial debt and be resolute in the demand for the immediate payment of the Carbon Debt from the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by rich countries. This debt is part of the transitional justice demands for fairness, compensation and reparation for the monumental harm done to the environment some of which are irreversible.\n\n\u201cAfrican delegates should ensure to speak with one voice to demand transitional justice in the payment of carbon debts currently put at 334 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. According to a recent study, the world\u2019s leading polluters have racked up a US$10 trillion carbon debt for carbon dioxide emissions since 1990. This demand for carbon debt payment is sacrosanct and does not deflect from the US$100 billion commitment for climate actions.\u201d\n\nOjo maintained, \u201cAccording to scientific evidence, rich countries contribution of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere account for 70% inclusive of 20% from the USA, while Africa contributes only 4% of the carbon dioxide. Further, the impact of climate change and Covid-19 pandemic and their impacts on escalating the debt service burden on African states is horrendous. This necessitates the call for debt cancellation for developing countries. Africa should be united to restate that she has been shortchanged and has no debt to pay because on the balance, it owes no debt.\u201d\n\nERA/FoEN commended the United Kingdom (UK) government as host, for taking the decision to end support for fossil fuels sector overseas hence the government will no longer support the development of fossil fuel sector overseas including end to export finance and credits, funding for new crude oil, natural gas and coal projects overseas.\n\n...",

They represent a priceless heritage, which is an affirmation of our collective memory and a valuable source of knowledge since they reflect the cultural, social, and linguistic diversity of our communities.\n\n\u201cThey help us grow and comprehend the world we all share. Conserving this heritage and ensuring it remains accessible to the public and future generations is a vital goal for all memory institutions, as well as the public at large.\n\n\u201cThe World Day for Audiovisual Heritage (WDAH) provides an occasion to raise general awareness of the need to take urgent measures and to acknowledge the importance of audiovisual documents.

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has gotten the nod of Federal Executive Council (FEC), to construct 21 federal roads across the six-geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nThe approval was given at the FEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nMinister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola who briefed State House correspondents at the end of the council meeting, said the selected 21 roads totalled 1804.6 kilometers.\n\nAccording to the minister, it was a strategic intervention under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nFashola explained that it was under Executive Order 7 that allowed the private sector to deploy in advance the taxes they would pay for infrastructure development.\n\nHe said nine of the selected projects are in North Central, three in North East, two in North West, two in South East, three in South-South and two in South West.\n\nThe Minister said he presented three memoranda to the Council that was approved, explaining that two of the memoranda were on road contracts.\n\nHe said the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road, especially the section to Apet Central where there was a problem with the steel-reinforced drain discovered there.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago, and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replace them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved.\n\n\u201cThe second memorandum relates to the road infrastructure tax credit scheme. You recall Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\n\u201cDo you recall that I had briefed you here about the use of that policy like the Dangote Group from Obajana to Kabba, Apapa to Oworoshoki?\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads, the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto and a couple of others and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was approved about N320 something billion.\n\n\u201cSo today, we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and commitment to deploying taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government the corporation was known as NNPC. So NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. So now the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps the government to achieve many things, including Ministerial Mandates Three and Four, which we discussed at the last retreat if you recall was energy sufficiency, electric power, and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course, petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure, which is the Ministerial mandate four.\n\n\u201cSo, NNPC has sought and the council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the Six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North Central, particularly Niger state. And the reason is that Niger State is a major storage centre for NNPC. So the reason NNPC is doing this is to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen and have heard every year Niger State gridlock, the governor complaining that his roads are being damaged by trucks, by those who overload the trucks after damaging the roads themselves now protest the damage that they sometimes have induced. Anyway, this is the final solution to that problem.\n\n\u201cSo there are nine like that in north-central, there are three in the Northeast. Two in the northwest, two in the southeast, three roads, the entire Odupani \u2013 Itu \u2013 Ikot Ekpene road in LOT 1, 2, and 3 now fully covered.\n\n\u201cThen in the southwest, you have the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the entire junction and you also have the Ibadan to Ilorin in Oyo-Ogbumosho section. So that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cIn the south east, you have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuano to Ikot Ekpene road and so on. In the Northwest, it is Gada-Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau -Gusau-Sokoto road.\n\n\u201cIn the northeast, it is Cham-, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road. The roads impacted in north-central include Ilorin -Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani sections I and II, Suleja-Minna sections I and II, Bida-Lambatta, and then Again-Katcha-Baro road. Then Mokwa-Makera-Tegina-Kaduna all in Niger State.\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, it is a total of 21 roads. What will happen as a result of this is that there will be no financing problems regarding the execution of these roads anymore. So, some of these roads that I have mentioned, let me tell you, what has changed. For example, Aba-Ikot Ekpene road has an estimate of about N30.33,399 billion to complete it. The provision in the budget this year is only N200 million. If you look at Suleja-Minna road section II, it has N25.763 billion to complete it.\n\n\u201cThe provision in the budget this year is just N100 million. So, with this intervention, all those roads now will be fully funded, we won\u2019t have budgetry challenges and financing challenges. So, the council approved this as strategic funding these roads.\u201d\n\nFashola explained that the payment for the total sum for the 21 road contracts was not a one-off payment.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe whole package is N621,237,143,897.75 billion. Let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax for about three years. On the time frame of completion, the completion time already exists. They have scheduled completion times.\n\n\u2018\u2019What has hobbled them and hampered them is that the annual budgetary provisions have not been enough.

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\n\u2018Fourth Wave of Pandemic Imminent\u2019\n\nThere is possibility of the fourth wave of Coronavirus (COVID-19) as the Yuletide approaches, Lagos State Government declared on Wednesday.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, however, launched a mass vaccination campaign as part of the strategies to stave off re-emergence of the viral infection. The objective is aimed at vaccinating four million residents in Lagos before the end of the year.\n\nThe immunisation programme was flagged off with a symbolic event held at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island. Residents of Lagos, who are 18 years and above are eligible to be fully immunised with the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe accelerated vaccine rollout is tagged: \u201cOperation Count Me in 4 Million Lagosians Vaccinated Against COVID-19\u201d and it is being undertaken by Lagos State Government in collaboration with National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA).\n\nThe Governor believed the mass vaccination campaign would help bolster the State\u2019s response to the emerging threat posed by the pandemic.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the joint committee set up by the Lagos State Government and NPHCDA to oversee the implementation of the campaign would be opening vaccination sites in high traffic locations as part of the strategies to expand vaccine access in underserved communities. Mobile vans, the Governor added, would be deployed to move round boundary settlements in order to reach individuals in areas with limited access to health facilities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is potential for the fourth wave of COVID-19, as our borders would be opened to all people coming into Lagos in December. To prevent the catastrophic events we witnessed in the previous waves, the State has developed a robust vaccination drive, leveraging on both the strengths we have in the public and private sectors of our healthcare system. In development of our strategy and counter-measures, we prioritise the protection of human lives and keeping our economy open for business.\n\n\u201cTo mitigate against this potential damage that will further spread existing variants of COVID-19 in the State, and accelerate efforts towards herd immunity, the need for a different strategy became a front burner issue. This is what has culminated in the campaign, tagged \u2018Count Me In! 4 million Lagosians Vaccinated Against COVID-19\u2019 to target the full vaccination of 4 million Lagos residents before the end of December 2021. Once achieved, this will bring the State closer to reaching our promise to vaccinate 30 percent of our population within one year.\u201d\n\nSince March when Lagos started its vaccination programme, Sanwo-Olu said the State had successfully vaccinated 800,000 residents with the first dose of Moderna vaccine and 310,000 persons fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThis, he said, sums total number of residents vaccinated with the first dose of either AstraZeneca or Moderna to 1.2 million, while raising the number of fully vaccinated individuals to 550,000, which accounts for about four per cent of the State\u2019s population.\n\nSanwo-Olu re-emphasised that the vaccines being administered are safe and remain free of charge in public health facilities. The Governor, however, said an administrative charge of N6,000 would be paid by individuals who wish to get the vaccines at approved private facilities.\n\nThe Governor charged all stakeholders, including the local council chairmen, to mobilise for participation in the programme and ensure the success of the campaign.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have set up COVID-19 vaccination in all our 205 public primary health centres, 14 of the State\u2019s second and tertiary hospitals, and we are hoping that this partnership can be implemented in over 400 private health centres across seven underserved Local Government Areas in the State.\n\n\u201cLet me re-emphasise that we are not compelling anyone to get vaccinated. But, we want everyone to take it as personal responsibility, which is highly important. What we seek to achieve by this campaign is to ensure there is access to the vaccines and availability. Then, give people an opportunity to get vaccinated at centres close to them. This will give nobody a reason not to get the vaccines.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, described the vaccination campaign as \u201cambitious\u201d, saying the State Government had put in place two-pronged approach to prevent the fourth wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to control the in-bound flight passengers and maintain adherence to all preventive measures that have been put in place, while the second step is to closely monitor the isolation of those coming from the red zone area,\u201d Abayomi said.\n\nNPHCDA Executive Director, Dr. Shuaib Faisal, disclosed that only 2,950,232 Nigerians had been fully vaccinated, which is a far cry from reaching the target number for herd immunity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have enough vaccines in storage to give many people the opportunity to get vaccinated. We now have the jabs, but we now need the arms.\u201d\n\nThe campaign kicked off with symbolic vaccination of Mr. Okeke Onyeama, a private security guard, who was inoculated in presence of the Governor and NPHCDA boss.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Osinbajo: Nigeria\u2019s Population Grows By 5 Million Annually",
          "text": "He stressed the importance of the national health insurance scheme to Nigeria\u2019s development, saying that \u201cwithout compulsory health insurance, we simply cannot bring together the resources that are required to provide decent healthcare for 200 million people, growing by five million every year\u2026 I think the game-changer is health insurance.\u201d\n\n\ufffcOsinbajo stated this on Tuesday while rounding up his thoughts during an interaction at the closing of the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit in Abuja (NES #27) themed: \u201cSecuring Our Future, the Fierce Urgency of Now.\u201d\n\nOn developing the health sector and government\u2019s ongoing reforms, the vice president said, \u201cWe are at a point now with the healthcare reform committee, which I have the privilege of chairing, where we are looking at all these options. We are trying to see in what ways we can ensure that this will work.\n\n\u201cSo, there are huge revolutionary changes that need to be made and I believe that they are entirely possible. And we are at a point where these things are accessible to us, with time we can do these things, I am certainly looking forward to some of the reforms that are possible,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting the contributions of the private sector, the vice president said \u201cthe private sector in Nigeria (in terms of resilience and coping with challenges), has done very well, with what we have learned, even coping with the post-pandemic issues (business after the pandemic), the private sector has done well.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, transport went down 49 per cent, and now they are back with 77%. The construction sector went down by almost 40 per cent, and has returned to a much more modest positive,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo explained.\n\nThe vice president said with the energy of the youth, the resilience of the private sector combined with governments implementing the right policies, Nigeria will make the desired progress despite the challenges in the economy.\n\nOsinbajo, in a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, praised the strong will of the average Nigerian, adding that, \u201cwe can see that there is a will to do things, there is energy, resilience, resourcefulness. My take is that this country is one that is waiting to happen and it will happen. It will take all of our resources, and all of our effort to make it happen, and it will happen.\u201d\n\n\ufffc\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must focus on what this country offers in terms of all the resources that we have, human, natural and everything that we have \u2013 the will, the energy, the innovativeness of the Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThis sort of country, a country with all that we have, can simply not fail, and it is only a matter of getting things right and moving a few things around, and we will be well on the way to the kind of progress that we ought to experience as a country.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo explained that despite the limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic among other challenges, the government was working hard to address defects in the system, and noted that recent results were indicative of recovery across different sectors of the economy.\n\nHis words, \u201cI believe very strongly that all of the great ideas that we have, the young people waiting to unleash their energy and resourcefulness on the world, all of those are just waiting to happen.\n\n\u201cI believe very strongly that this country affords us the opportunity and the space to be able to achieve great things. We should keep our focus.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that the Buhari administration was ramping up efforts in different sectors to improve development and the economy.\n\nWhile urging state governments to do more, especially in the area of education, the VP stated that \u201cwe must emphasize Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM). This is an area where a curriculum is being redeveloped to accommodate that.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that basic education \u2013 primary and secondary education are under the control of the states. The federal government does not handle primary or secondary education. Yes, we do have some unity schools, but these things are really the business of the states.\u201d\n\nCiting the work being done by the National Economic Council in developing the country\u2019s human capital, the VP said, \u201cat the level of the NEC, which I have the privilege of chairing, one of the things that we have tried to do with the whole human capital development space, we have a whole dashboard where we are looking at performances in the states.",

          "title": "Amidst outcry, FEC okays N621bn NNPC fund to fix 21 roads, Niger tops with 9 projects",
          "text": "The Federal Executive Council (FEC) Wednesday approved the takeover of the reconstruction of 21 federal roads across the six geopolitical zones of the country by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at the cost of N621billion.\n\nThe decision is coming at a time there is continued outcry by citizens over the state of Nigerian roads.\n\nBriefing State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo(SAN), Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola (SAN) said the approval was in line with Executive Order No. 007 of 2019 cited as the Companies Income Tax (Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme) Order, 2019.\n\nThe minister said the strategic intervention under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme in respect of 21 roads covers 1,804.6 kilometers.\n\nHe said the Executive Order 7 allows the private sector to deploy taxes in advance if they would pay for infrastructure development.\n\nMajor resolutions\n\nThe minister also said nine of the selected projects were in North-central, three in North-east, two in North-west, two in South-east, three in South-south, and two in South-west.\n\nFashola said he presented three memoranda to the Council, all of which were approved, stressing that the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road, especially the section to Apet Central.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through, otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction in order to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replace them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved,\u201d he said.\n\nOn NNPC\n\nFashola also said: \u201cThe second memorandum relates to the road infrastructure tax credit scheme. You recall the Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\n\u201cSo you recall that I had briefed you here about the use of that policy like the Dangote Group from Obajana to Kabba, Apapa to Oworoshoki.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads, the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto and couple of others and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was approved about N320 something billion.\n\n\u201cSo today, we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and committed to deploy taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC. So NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. So, now, the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps government to achieve many things, including Ministerial Mandates Three and Four, which we discussed at the last retreat, if you recall, was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course, petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure, which is the ministerial mandate four.\n\n\u201cSo, NNPC has sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North-central, particularly Niger state. And the reason is that Niger State is a major storage centre for NNPC. So the reason NNPC is doing this is to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen and have heard every year Niger State gridlock, the governor complaining that his roads are being damaged by trucks, by those who overload the trucks after damaging the roads themselves now protest the damage that they sometimes have induced. Anyway, this is the final solution to that problem.\n\n\u201cSo there are nine like that in north central, there are three in the Northeast. Two in the northwest, two in the southeast, three roads, the entire Odupani \u2013 Itu \u2013 Ikot Ekpene road in LOT 1, 2 and 3 now fully covered.\n\n\u201cThen in the South-west, you have the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the entire junction and you also have the Ibadan to Ilorin in Oyo-Ogbumosho section. So that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cIn the South-east, you have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuano to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth. In the North-west, it is Gada-Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau -Gusau-Sokoto road.\n\n\u201cIn the northeast, it is Cham-, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road. The roads impacted in north central include Ilorin -Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani sections I and II, Suleja-Minna sections I and II, Bida-Lambatta, and then Agaie-Katcha-Baro road. Then Mokwa-Makera-Tegina-Kaduna all in Niger State.\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, it is a total of 21 roads. What will happen as a result of this is that there will be no financing problems with regarding the execution of these roads anymore. So, some of these roads that I have mentioned, let me tell you, what has changed. For example, Aba-Ikot Ekpene road has an estimate of about N30.33,399 billion to complete it.\n\n\u201cThe provision in the budget this year is only N200 million. If you look at Suleja-Minna road section II, it has N25.763 billion to complete it. The provision in the budget this year is just N100 million. So, with this intervention, all those roads now will be fully funded, we won\u2019t have budgetary challenges and financing challenges. So, council approved this as a strategic funding of these roads.\u201d\n\nPayment mode\n\nThe minister explained that the payment for total sum of the 21 road contracts was not a one off payment.\n\n\u201cThe whole package is N621, 237,143,897.75 billion. Let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax for about three years. On timeframe of completion, the completion time already exists. They have scheduled completion times. What has hobbled and hampered them is that the annual budgetary provisions have not been enough. So, what it does now is that government can save, like the Lagos-Ibadan, 2nd Niger bridge arrangement and all of those types of roads,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether government would still go ahead to release the funds budgeted for the roads to be fixed by NNPC, he said: \u201cWhat you see here is that, I mentioned some cases, like for the Oku Iboku power plant section, it has N79 billion to finish, there was no provision at all in the 2021 budget. In the places where there\u2019s provision maybe N100 million, we are more than halfway to the budget we started implementing. So, it probably has been paid and where it has not been paid, the certificate is pending, we will pay and from then on, we will move to the new financing structuring just as we transited the second Niger Bridge, the Lagos-Ibadan expressway from the old budgetary arrangement to the new arrangement, we will transit this too. So those are administrative things and we will be meeting all the contractors to review all the agreements and all the performance and then we will take it from there.\u201d\n\nPower sector\n\nIn his briefing, Minister of Power Abubakar D. Aliyu said the council approved award of contract for the design, manufacture, supply and construction of 55 Kilometer Agu Akwa Umuchu 132 KVA double circuit transmission line and substation having two transformers at Umuchu Umuchu with two by 132 KV line bay extension at Agu Akwa for Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).\n\nHe said the project is between Anambra and Enugu states and was awarded in favour of Messrs Cartlark International Limited and has dollar and naira components.\n\n\u201cThe naira component is N4, 044,309,380.69 inclusive of 7.5% VAT and 7.5% contingency payable to the Central Bank of Nigeria at the prevailing exchange rate with the completion period of 34 months. This is part of the expansion and modernization of the TCN transmission grid and council has approved that.\n\n\u201cThe second one was approval for award of contract for a procurement and supply of two \u201cFail Safe\u201d 60 MVA, 132 /33KV transformers for transmission Company of Nigeria. They are protecting themselves against fire outbreak.\n\n\u201cThey are made in a way that once there is any fire outbreak it will not affect the transformers. So, these are modern equipments that are being procured to replace the old one, this is also part of the modernization of the equipment on the transmission lines.\n\n\u201cSo, the total control sum is N1, 018,432,930.68 made up of \u20ac1,904,237.50 (offshore component) plus N155, 875,000 (onshore component) inclusive of 7.5% VAT, with delivery period of nine months. This was also approved by council.\n\n\u201cThe third one is approval for variation of an ongoing contract for the construction of two by MVA 330 132/33 KV two by 60 MVA 132/33 KV substations, these are all transformers. And four by 330 KV line bay extension at Akure, and four by 330 KV line bay extension each Ochigbo and Benin north was awarded by the ministerial tender board MTV commercials to Messers Metelak SAL Engineering and constructing limited, on 27 September 2011, in the sum of $19,025,535.45 plus N1,068,728,996 inclusive of 5% VAT as at that time. So, it became obvious and necessary to seek for this variation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said: \u201cSo, the contractor requested and the necessary checks were done and the contract is now being increased by this memo to the council.\n\n\u201cThis approval seeks to increase the contract amount from the amount stated. The offshore components still remain; the onshore is now increased to N1, 460,398,661.75. This is with inclusive of 7.5% VAT and the council graciously approved this. So, there is an increase of the sum of N377, 669,675.75.\n\n\u201cBut this is not a one off payment. So, let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax of about three years. On time frame of completion, the completion time already exists. They have scheduled completion times.\u201d\n\nTraders lament Abuja/Lagos\n\nMeanwhile, traders moving their goods from Lagos to Abuja and other northern parts of the country have described the Lagos-Abuja road as terrible, lamenting that the route is affecting the movement of their goods.\n\nA cross section of traders, who spoke with Blueprint, said as a result of the deplorable nature of the roads, they were unable to secure trucks that would move their goods to the northern parts of the country despite the high price.\n\nA trader, who preferred anonymity, called on the federal government to salvage the situation, disclosing that truck drivers were using the deplorable condition of the road as an excuse not to come to Abuja..\n\n\u201cLagos-Abuja Road is terrible, help us tell the government, we\u2019re now finding it difficult to get trucks to Abuja. Since yesterday, I\u2019ve been unable to secure a truck despite the high price; they claim that roads to the North are spoiling their trucks\u201d, the concerned trader lamented.\n\nAnother trader, who simply identified herself asHajiya, lamented that she had been denied access to move her goods to Abuja due to the deplorable condition several times, alleging that some truck drivers used the situation to increase their fare unjustly.\n\nShe, however, called on the government to intervene on the route to save her means of livelihood.\n\nBlueprint had earlier reported that some sections of the Nigerian roads were not in good condition. One of our correspondents who recently embarked on a tour of Lagos state from Abuja, observed the poor state of that axis of the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some sections of Okene/Kabba roads are not in good condition, while Akure-Owo expressway, Akure-Ado Ekiti and Ilesha-Ibadan axis of the road were also in deplorable conditions.\n\nNLC unhappy\n\nAlso, the Ogun state chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed its disappointment at Minister Fashola over what they called unfulfilled promises on the collapsed portion of Sango road.\n\nSpeaking at a protest held Wednesday, the state chairman of the labour union, Comrade Emmanuel Bankole described the minister an enemy of the state, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t want to see him, he lied to us, he fooled us.\u201d\n\nThe NLC had October 6 stormed the Sango portion of the Lagos-Abeokuta highway, with a threat to shut down the state if nothing was done within 21 days.\n\nAt the expiration of the 21- day ultimatum, Ogun workers and residents gathered at Sango again for a protest, carrying placards with various inscriptions such as , \u201cEnough of bad governance\u201d, \u201cDapo Abiodun, let us enjoy the dividends of democracy in Ogun\u201d, \u201cDapo, this suffering is too much\u201d, \u201cHear our cries, Ogun people are suffering\u201d, \u201cDapo repair our roads, it is our right,\u201d amongst others.\n\nThe NLC chairman said: \u201c21 days ago, we were here. We gave ultimatum to the government that we are not pleased with the state of the roads, particularly the minister coming here to promise that palliative works will commence immediately and several weeks after, nothing was done. That was why the 21- day ultimatum was given.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, few days ago, they started some works. We can see some loads of granites by the state government. But this is not what we asked for. The minister was here and he promised to commence immediate palliative, that is yet to happen.\u201d\n\nImo residents lament\n\nIn a related development, the current state of roads in Imo state has become a serious concern to Imo residents, especially now that it rains heavily almost on a daily basis.\n\nSome residents who spoke to Blueprint said there is hardly any road in the state that i motorable, thus putting their vehicles in a state of disrepair.\n\nOne of our respondents, Oparaji from Umuguma in Owerri West local government area, said their youth had to protest over the deplorable state of the World Bank/Umuguma Road Wednesday.\n\nThis, he said, was because whenever it rained, the road would turn into a river and would become impassable, thereby putting residents or pedestrians in a state of jeopardy.\n\nAnother resident living at World Bank Housing Estate, Obichere, was dismayed that the World Bank Road reconstructed by Senator Hope Uzodimma some months ago and which the commissioner of works, Mr Ralph Nwosu, described as solid like the Port Harcourt Road, had started wearing off.\n\n\u201d We are now confused because we do not know whether the former governor, Rochas Okorocha is better than Uzodimma in terms of road construction. They have all disappointed our people because they don\u2019t have what it takes to deliver the desired dividends of democracy to the people. When Uzodimma came on board, he criticised Okorocha\u2019s wasteful spending and deplorable roads which he inherited from him and assured that he would rectify things. But now, the reverse is the case as they are now on the same boat,\u201d the resident said.\n\nOther roads that have become a source of worry are the Nekede/Ihiagwa road which leads to Federal Polytechnic Nekede and Federal University of Technology (FUTO), MCC/Uratta Road, Works Layout and so many others in town.",
          "summary": "007 of 2019 cited as the Companies Income Tax (Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme) Order, 2019.\nSo NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy.\n\u201cSo, NNPC has sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the six geopolitical zones.\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North-central, particularly Niger state.\n\u201cSo, as I said, it is a total of 21 roads.",

          "text": "Prices of bread in Enugu state may rise by 200 per cent before the end of the year, a survey by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has revealed.\n\nThe development is causing some level of anxiety on the part of both the producers and consumers.\n\nAlready, price of bread has doubled since August through to October 2021, forcing the product out of reach of many families and lovers of bread.\n\nA survey conducted by NAN Wednesday in Enugu showed the price may likely jump further in November and December, if not controlled.\n\nThe development has so far been blamed on incessant increases in the prices of baking materials, factory rent and wages, which had made it difficult for the bakers to make a profit or break even.\n\nThe persistent increases in the cost of baking materials, in particular, has forced many bakers out of the business, and left others seeking government\u2019s intervention to survive, the survey revealed.\n\nIn May, the Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN) directed its members nationwide to increase prices of bread and other items by 30 per cent due to the prevailing economic situation of the country.\n\nSome of the producers who spoke to NAN said they jerked up the price due to high cost of production, as well as prices of such materials as sugar, butter, yeast and flour.\n\nThis, they said, has reduced the quantity and quality of bread produced in the state, eliminating bread as a major food for the common man and making it food for the rich.\n\nA baker, Mr. Peter Ohajiuba said he was tired of the bread business due to the uncontrollable costs associated with it.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising and unbelievable how the cost of baking materials keep increasing on daily basis. We no longer produce the quantity we used to produce and people are complaining about the prices at which we sell it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe baker identified flour as being sold at N10, 000 in August, but had risen to N22,000, a bag of sugar sold for N14,500 was now N21,000, Butter sold for N11,000 is now selling at N21,000, Nylon, which sold for N8, is now sold at N13. 50 kobo and gas, which sold for N3, 500 is now N7, 500.\n\nOhajiuba stressed further that he pays a monthly rent of N20,000 and pays wages ranging from N20,000 to N35, 000, depending on the job they do.\n\n\u201cWith all these running costs, how can one make gain, the major aim of venturing into any business,\u201d he asked?\n\nAccording to him, many bread factories in the state had shut their operations due to unaccommodated running expenses.\n\nHe added that if nothing was done before October ending, the unit price of bread would double.\n\nOhajiuba noted that the material they used in making one bag of flour early 2021 was now used to make half a bag.\n\nAnother baker, Uchenna Okafor said that as a matter of urgency, the government should look into the cost of these materials, as well as provide loans to bakers to produce more bread and employ more workers.\n\n\u201cThere is no market as people complain of no money, coupled with our having to pay workers. They will become a nuisance to the society if we are forced to sack them and close down our businesses.\n\n\u201cA price control mechanism should be put in place to monitor the cost of things in the market, to enable us meet our target and demands,\u201d he suggested.\n\nHe reiterated that if they bought materials at a lower rate, they would sell to customers at a cheaper rate.\n\nA retailer, Mrs. Chika Aliejim said the sizes of bread she bought for N550 a few months ago had gone up to N800, the one of N350 now sold at N600 and the one of N200 sold at N500.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is that the quantity of bread these days is laughable as an individual can finish N300 loaf of bread and will still be hungry.\n\n\u201cI usually make gain of N80 on one bread, but now I make only N20 and we were told that raw materials for making the bread had gone up,\u201d she said.\n\nCSO, baker speak\n\nIn a reaction, Executive Director Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA) Ezenwa Nwangwu, said Nigeria had been \u201cstruggling with convulsions resulting from debilitating effects of IMF-World bank economic prescriptions even now worsened and compounded by COVID-19 , corruption, insecurity/terrorism in some parts of the country and dwindling oil revenue.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cthe concomitant effect of this inarguably will be low production, inflation and high cost of living.\n\n\u201cGovernment and citizens must work together to confront the emergency through boosting agriculture and all its value chain, fight terrorism , confront insecurity, shun tokenism and create real jobs through industrialization.\n\nAlso the Chief Executive Officer of Nextar bread, Mrs. Bukola Adewunmi said though their customers have been complaining about the hike of bread from N400 to N600.\n\nThe baker however said she won\u2019t be able to ascertain the next increase because the country\u2019s economic meltdown had hiked the prices of raw materials while some of the raw materials are unavailable in the market and so they improvised.\n\n\n\nShe said another major challenge is multiple taxation by different government agencies doing the same work.\n\nAdewunmi said payment of huge taxes is killing some businesses in the country.\n\nShe also complained that electricity is another problem because \u201cwe pay heavily for light and most time we don\u2019t get the light and without light we can\u2019t do business as diesel is very expensive.\u201d\n\nBut to Abdulazeez Olamilekan Abdulrahman, a youth corps member serving Abuja, \u201cthis is about the cheapest and most accessible food for the common man. Government needs to act fast and nip this in the bud. We can\u2019t effort to operate as if no one is in control. Let us afford bread crisis because it is one mayhem the nation can\u2019t afford. Personally, I like bread, so some other downtrodden. \u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Senate Committee on Interior has moved to increase the daily feeding cost of inmates in Nigerian correctional facilities.\n\nThe issue was raised on Wednesday when the Comptroller General of Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS), Mr Haliru Nababa appeared before the committee members to defend the 2022 budget of the agency.\n\nAccording to the committee, there are 66,340 inmates in correctional centres across the country, out of which an alarming 47,559 of them are yet to be convicted and are awaiting trial.\n\nREAD ALSO: NDLEA Considers Six Standard Rehab Centres To Tackle Drug Addiction\n\nThe committee members, therefore, expressed concern about the welfare of inmates specifically, their feeding.\n\n\u201cWhen you send a criminal to prison, the person becomes worse when the person is coming out, instead of becoming better, so I am thinking, Mr Chairman, this issue of feeding should be looked at properly,\u201d a member of the committee, Senator Chukwuka Utazi said.\n\nIn response, the Comptroller General of NCS said that the current N450 feeding cost for each of the prisoners on daily basis has been increased to N750 as proposed in the 2022 budget estimates.\n\nHe said this development made most of the custodial centres to be congested and fall below the international standard of correctional services.\n\nNot satisfied, the Committee Chairman, Senator Kashim Shettima and members of the committee frowned at the N750 daily feeding cost.\n\nSenator Utazi, therefore, made a move on behalf of the committee, saying N750 going by the value of Naira today and high costs of consumables, is inadequate.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman, I will urge this committee to jerk up the proposed N750 feeding cost per day on each of the inmates at the custodian centres to at least N1,000.00 because no grown-up Nigeria today can survive with N750 per day as far as feeding is concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nSeconding the motion, Senator Ibrahim Oloriegbe, said the N1,000 proposed should be the minimum and must be reflected in the final budget to be passed for the correctional service.\n\nThe committee also stressed the need for renovation of correctional centres across the country to reduce incessant cases of jailbreak.",

The people of Nigeria are grateful,\u201d said Isola while passing on the thanks of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPrince Erediauwa, on his part, said, \u201cJesus College is indeed challenging the erroneous arguments that stolen art cannot be returned because of the existence of different legal jurisdictions on the matter.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the head of Jesus College, Sonita Alleyne, handed the elaborately carved cockerel to the Nigerian delegation amid cheers and a trumpet fanfare.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be the first institution to simply act,\u201d said Alleyne, hailing a \u201creally historic occasion\u201d as she formally transferred the cockerel\u2019s ownership. \u201cWe are delighted that it is now with its rightful owner.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Quai Branly Museum in Paris is exhibiting a trove of Benin treasures for a final time before they are handed back to Nigeria.\n\nTijani is expected to travel to Scotland to receive another Benin bronze from the University of Aberdeen on Thursday.",

          "text": "The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the reconstruction of 21 roads covering a total distance of 1,804.6 kilometres across the six geo-political zones.\n\nThese projects are to be undertaken by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) through the deployment of its own tax liabilities.\n\nMinister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, announced the approval on Wednesday while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the FEC meeting held in Abuja.\n\nIn July, FEC approved the award of a contract to Dangote Industries for the construction of five roads totalling 274.9 kilometres at the cost of N309.9 billion, advanced by the company as tax credit.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads \u2013 the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto, and a couple of others, and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was about N320 billion,\u201d Fashola said.\n\n\u201cSo today (Wednesday), we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest, but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and commitment to deploy taxes. It\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC.\n\n\u201cSo, NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. Now, the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps the government to achieve many things, including ministerial mandates three and four, which we discussed at the last retreat. ministerial mandates three and four, if you recall, was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course, petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure which is the ministerial mandate four. NNPC has sought and the council has approved today that NNPC deploys tax resources to 21 roads, covering a total distance of 1,804.6 kilometres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North Central, particularly Niger state. The reason is that Niger State is a major storage centre for NNPC. NNPC is doing this to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\u201d\n\nFashola gave an assurance that in the South-West, the Lagos-Badagry Expressway, the Agabara junction, Ibadan to Ilorin (Oyo-Ogbomoso section) will be fixed.\n\nThree other roads are located in the North-East, two in the North-West, and two others in the South-East.\n\nThe Odukpani-Itu-Ikot-Ekpene road, the minister said, has now been fully covered to resolve the problem of financing regarding the execution of the road projects.\n\nSpeaking about the South-East, he stated, \u201cYou have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom States. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuamo, to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cIn the North-West, it is Gada Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau-Gusau-Sokoto road. In the North-East, it is Cham, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road.\u201d\n\nThere will be no more financing problems regarding the execution of roads, said Fashola.",

There is a presidential election coming up in France and I think all the signs are that the rhetoric has been ramped up ahead of that on the fishing issue,\u201d Deas told the BBC.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has not yet confirmed he will seek a second term in April\u2019s election but is widely expected to run.\n\nMARITIME GENDARMES\n\nFrench maritime gendarmes made multiple checks on fishing vessels off the northern French port of Le Havre overnight, the Maritime Ministry said, as France steps up surveillance during negotiations.\n\nThe seized trawler, now under the control of French judicial authorities, had been rerouted to Le Havre under a maritime police escort and was tied up at on the port\u2019s quayside.\n\nThe vessel\u2019s captain could face criminal charges, with his catch confiscated, the ministry added.\n\nThe Marine Traffic app showed a British fishing vessel named Cornelis Gert Jan tied up in the port of Le Havre. The French maritime patrol vessel Atos was moored behind it.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm the name of the detained vessel.\n\nMarine Traffic data showed that the Cornelis Gert Jan had been operating in the Baie de Seine on Wednesday evening, where the Atos had been conducting checks. Both vessels set course for Le Havre at around 2000 CET (1800 GMT).\n\nBritain has said it issued fishing licenses to vessels able to show a track record of operating in its waters in the years prior to its withdrawal from the EU.\n\nNegotiations between Britain and the European Commission, the EU executive, have continued this week.\n\nFrench officials accuse Britain of failing to honour its word since Brexit, citing fishing and a demand to renegotiate a protocol that aims to maintain the integrity of the EU single market.\n\nAdditional customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and the continent via the Channel Tunnel and ferries could seriously disrupt trade flows just as businesses stock up for the year-end festive period.",

          "text": "The top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, has provided the first official U.S. confirmation of a Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing\u2019s pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defenses.\n\nThe Pentagon has been at pains to avoid direct confirmation of the Chinese test this summer, first reported by the Financial Times, even as President Joe Biden and other officials have expressed general concerns about Chinese hypersonic weapons development.\n\nBut Milley explicitly confirmed a test and said that it was \u201cvery close\u201d to a Sputnik moment \u2014 referring Russia\u2019s 1957 launch of the first man-made satellite, which put Moscow ahead in the Cold War-era space race.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw was a very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system. And it is very concerning,\u201d Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Bloomberg television, in an interview aired on Wednesday.\n\nNuclear arms experts say China\u2019s weapons test appeared to be designed to evade U.S. defenses in two ways. First, hypersonics move at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kph (3,853 mph), making them harder to detect and intercept.\n\nSecond, sources tell Reuters that the United States believes China\u2019s test involved a weapon that first orbited the Earth. That\u2019s something military experts say is a Cold War concept known as \u201cfractional orbital bombardment.\u201d\n\nLast month, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall alluded to his concerns about such a system, telling reporters about a weapon that would go into an orbit and then descend on a target.\n\n\u201cIf you use that kind of an approach, you don\u2019t have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory \u2014 which is directly from the point of launch to the point of impact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to avoid defenses and missile warning systems.\u201d\n\nFractional Orbital Bombardment would also be a way for China to avoid U.S. missile defenses in Alaska, which are designed to combat a limited number of weapons from a country like North Korea.\n\nJeffrey Lewis at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies summed up fractional orbital bombardment this way: \u201cThe simplest way to think about China\u2019s orbital bombardment system is to imagine a space shuttle, put a nuclear weapon into the cargo bay, and forget about the landing gear.\u201d\n\nLewis said the difference is that the Chinese re-entry system is a glider.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry denied a weapons test. It said it had carried out a routine test in July, but added: \u201cIt was not a missile, it was a space vehicle.\u201d\n\nU.S. defenses are not capable of combating a large-scale attack from China or Russia, which could overwhelm the system. But the open U.S. pursuit of more and more advanced missile defenses has led Moscow and Beijing to examine ways to defeat them, experts say, including hypersonics and, apparently, fractional orbital bombardment.\n\nThe United States and Russia have both tested hypersonic weapons.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "A .45-caliber Colt revolver used on the set of the film \u201cRust\u201d was not thoroughly checked before being given to actor Alec Baldwin, who fired a live lead bullet in an accidental fatal shooting last week in New Mexico, according to officials and a new court filing.\n\nNew details about the incident emerged on Wednesday during a news conference by Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza and District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies and in an affidavit filed by the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nMendoza told reporters there was a complacent attitude toward safety on the set before last Thursday\u2019s shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal.\n\nHannah Gutierrez, the crew member in charge of weapons on the set, told investigators she had checked guns there but found no \u201chot rounds\u201d \u2013 apparently meaning live ammunition \u2013 before the shooting, according to the affidavit.\n\nDave Halls, the film\u2019s assistant director, handed the gun to Baldwin, telling the actor it was \u201ccold\u201d or safe.\n\n\u201cHe advised he should have checked all of them, but didn\u2019t,\u201d Halls told police, according to the affidavit. Halls was referring to the barrels of the revolver.\n\nHalls had been fired from a previous movie set in 2019 over a mishap with a gun, production company Rocket Soul said on Monday. He has made no public comment on the incident.\n\nMendoza and Carmack-Altwies said while no criminal charges have been filed, they are not ruling out that possibility.\n\n\u201cAll options are on the table. \u2026 No one has been ruled out at this point,\u201d Carmack-Altwies said of potential charges.\n\nLegal experts have said that criminal charges are possible but not likely against Baldwin. read more\n\nThe shooting has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, prompting a debate about safety protocols in film and television \u2013 including whether certain types of guns used as props should be banned \u2013 and working conditions on low-budget productions.\n\nGutierrez, whose job is formally called the film crew\u2019s armorer, said ammunition was not secured on the set during a lunch break before the shooting, the affidavit showed. It quoted her as saying that firearms were secured inside a safe during the break and that no live ammunition is ever kept on a movie set.\n\n\u201cOnly a few people\u201d had access to the safe and knew the combination to open it, Gutierrez said, according to the affidavit.\n\nAuthorities have collected three firearms, 500 rounds of ammunition \u2013 some believed to be live bullets \u2013 and several pieces of clothing, Mendoza said. Some of the ballistic evidence is being sent to an FBI crime lab for analysis, Mendoza added.\n\nAuthorities have the firearm used in the shooting and recovered the bullet from the shoulder of director Joel Souza, who was wounded but released from the hospital, Mendoza said. It appears the same bullet struck Souza and Hutchins, Mendoza added.\n\nMendoza said the gun used by Baldwin was an Italian-made Pietta Long Colt revolver.\n\n\u201cWe would consider it a live round \u2013 a bullet, live \u2013 because it did fire from the weapon and obviously caused the death of Ms. Hutchins and injured Mr. Souza,\u201d Mendoza said.\n\nBaldwin, 63, serves as a co-producer of \u201cRust,\u201d a Western film set in 1880s Kansas. Production on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, near Santa Fe, has been halted.\n\nMendoza said Baldwin, Halls and Gutierrez all are cooperating with the investigation.\n\nAsked about the use of real weapons on a movie set, the sheriff said, \u201cI think the industry has had a record recently of being safe. I think there was some complacency on this set. And I think there are some safety issues that need to be addressed by the industry and possibly by the state of New Mexico.\u201d\n\nBefore the incident, camera operators had walked off the set to protest working conditions.\n\nBaldwin was drawing a revolver across his body and pointing it at a camera while rehearsing when the weapon fired, according to court documents. There is no video footage of the incident, Mendoza said.\n\nThe film\u2019s producers have hired the law firm Jenner & Block to investigate the shooting. They said the lawyers \u201cwill have full discretion about who to interview and any conclusions they draw.\u201d\n\nReuters",
