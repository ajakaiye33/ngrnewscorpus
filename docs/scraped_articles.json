          "title": "Naval personnel deployed as gunmen kill nine in Kogi community",
          "text": "Naval personnel have been drafted to strengthen the security architecture in Bagana, Omala Local Government Area of Kogi State, following Tuesday\u2019s invasion of the community by gunmen, who allegedly killed nine persons.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that apart from the nine persons, who were shot dead, several others sustained varying degrees of injury.\n\nThe Chief Security Officer for the local government council, Stephen Shuaibu, said there were threats of reprisals from different quarters, hence the proactive move of deploying naval personnel to prevent a further breakdown of law and order.\n\nThe villagers, while recounting their ordeal, noted that since December 2014, the village had on two occasions been attacked, leading to the death of scores and burning down of houses.\n\nThey said incessant killings by militias had forced many residents to evacuate their families and belongings from their ancestral homes to become internally displaced persons in neighbouring villages and states.\n\nAccording to them, a prominent Hausa chief, Alhaji Audi Abdullahi, and the chief of Ihankpe were at different times abducted and killed by yet-to-be apprehended bandits.\n\nThey explained that seven of their children residing outside the state came home for the last Sallah celebration and were gruesomely murdered even as the video of their torture went viral.\n\nThe villagers alleged that the trouble might not be unconnected to the battle to control the resources of the community by the four major tribes of Igala, Hausa, Otutubatu and Ihankpe.\n\nA source said, \u201cBagana, although a multi ethnic community, used to be a haven of peace until the chiefs of Otutubatu and Ihankpe moved their headquarters from Omagede and Patanyi; these villages are more than 10 kilometres from Bagana, the headquarters of the Bagana District of the Omala LGA.\n\n\u201cThe two clans have been at each other\u2019s throat in an attempt to control the economic life of the village by using mercenaries to unleash terror on the village.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to control the carnage, the immediate past governor, Captain Idris Wada, had summoned the chiefs to Lokoja and warned them to maintain the peace, but unfortunately, the warning fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cThe then governor had stationed a detachment of soldiers and mobile policemen to maintain the peace, but they too became casualties as two soldiers and four policemen were lost to the AK-47 wielding militiamen.\u201d\n\nA community leader, Alhaji Ismaila Umar, urged Governor Yahaya Bello to establish a naval post and a police post in the village, saying its location on the bank of the River Benue had made it vulnerable to all kinds of criminals.\n\nThe paramount ruler of the Omala Local Government Area, Boniface Musa, condemned the killings and urged the chairman of the council, Ibrahim Aboh, and the governor to enforce the earlier directive to the unauthorised chiefs in Bagana to relocate to their domains.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP William Aya, said one Usman Salifu called the Divisional Police Officer on the telephone around 9.30pm on Tuesday that his shop had been attacked by gunmen, who killed his sales boy, Bashir Sule, and three other customers, while scores sustained varying degrees of injury.\n\nHe stated that on the receipt of the distress call, the DPO mobilised his men to the scene and evacuated some of the injured to hospital, adding that the command had commenced a manhunt for the assailants with a view to bringing them to justice.\n\nAya added that peace had returned to the community and asked the residents to return home to continue with their legitimate business.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "FORMER Minister of Agriculture, Mohammed Nanono; and former Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman, were sacked by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday because they failed what the regime called \u201cevaluation test.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, indications that more members of the Federal Executive Council will go at the end of another target evaluation that may be conducted in September or October.\n\nA Federal Government official who did not want his name in print told The PUNCH that the evaluation of the ministers based on their core targets was done by an unnamed consultancy firm.\n\nHe said the initial plan of government was that major changes would be carried out after what he called a second term review retreat which would hold either this month or in October.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe ministers were asked to go because they failed the evaluation test on their core targets. The evaluation was done by a consultancy firm, not government officials.\n\n\u201cA major second term review retreat is supposed to hold either this month or next. The plan is that the changes will take place during or after the retreat but maybe the President felt he needed to treat the two cases before the retreat.\n\n\u201cThat probably explains why he said it will be a continuous process. At the retreat, ministers will see the result of their evaluation and they will know their fate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a continuous process, says Buhari\n\nHowever, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), said due to periodic \u201cself-reviews,\u201d more members of his cabinet might be made to leave.\n\nThis was as he explained that the significant review steps were meant to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\n\nBuhari\u2019s announcement was contained in a statement on Wednesday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled \u2018President Buhari approves cabinet reshuffle\u2019.\n\nIn a statement to cabinet members during the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, the President approved a reshuffle in his cabinet which has so far run since August 21, 2019.\n\nBuhari sacks ministers to cover up failures, PDP alleges\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party described the decision of the President to sack two of his ministers, as \u201ca ludicrous and infective attempt to cover for his failures in office.\u201d\n\nThis is contained in a statement by the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, titled, \u2018PDP to Buhari: Don\u2019t use Nanono and Mamman to cover your failures\u2019.\n\nPart of the statement read, \u201cOur party is also investigating the real reason behind their sacking, given Mr. President\u2019s public approach to fighting corruption by \u201ceasing out\u201d the culprits.\n\n\u201cThe party however asserts that the manifest inefficiency of the Buhari administration is a product of the President\u2019s myopic and divisive approach to governance as well as the impunity and corruption deeply embedded in his administration and party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cThe PDP posits that even if the best hands are recruited, they will be contaminated by incompetence, impunity, disregard to rules, divisiveness and corruption that have become the hallmark of the APC and its administration.\u201d\n\nElectricity workers, excited over ministers\u2019 sacking\n\nMeanwhile, some stakeholders have commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on his decision to sack the two ministers.\n\nThe General Secretary of the National Union of Electricity Employees of Nigeria, Joe Ajaero, told The PUNCH that the former minister lacked the pedigree and capacity to occupy the position and worked against the progress of the sector.\n\nAjaero said, \u201cBesides not having any pedigree, the man came there with a different motive which was adversarial to power generation, distribution and transmission.\n\n\u201cHis first attack was on some of the best brains in the sector. After getting them out of the way, he became a clog in the wheel of progress in the sector. In him, we had a minister who couldn\u2019t articulate any policy directly. In him, we had a minister who couldn\u2019t study a robust memo.\u201d\n\nNCPN commends Buhari, AFAN president congratulates new minister\n\nAlso, the President of Nigeria Consumer Protection Network, Mr Kunle Olubiyo, commended Buhari on the sacking of the ministers.\n\nHe further justified the termination of their appointment, which he said, was as a result of the ministers\u2019 poor attitude to work.\n\nOlubiyo said, \u201cIt was a case of lame-duck, lackadaisical, and laissez-faire attitude towards serious national policies issues that affect the PMB\u2019s Economic Sustainability Strategic Programme. The President\u2019s action is no doubt in order.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Aminu Masari, was passed by the assembly during its plenary, presided over by the Speaker, Alhaji Tasi\u2019u Maigari\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the passage of the bill followed the presentation of the report of an ad-hoc committee, chaired by Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Shehu Dalhatu-Tafoki.\n\nDalhatu-Tafoki (APC-Faskari) said that the committee was named \u201cad-hoc committee on contributory defined benefit pension scheme.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Allocate more pension assets to infrastructure\n\nHe explained that the bill was an embodiment of a proposal from the executive for the introduction of a new pension policy for the state.\n\n\u201cThe presentation of the bill itself was in line with the reform of the pension system initiated by the Federal Government in 2004.\n\n\u201cThe reform culminated in the enactment of the Pension Reform Act, 2014.\n\n\u201cThe new act has made it mandatory for states, local governments and private sectors to adopt and implement the contributory scheme for their employees,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe lawmaker added that the only significant difference between the new pension scheme and the current system was the size of contribution which an employee was required to make under the new scheme.\n\n\u201cThe Katsina State government desired to emulate the model operated by Jigawa State government which is based on defined benefit. Consequently, the model is a replica of that of Jigawa.\n\n\u201cThe bill has made adequate transitional provision that will guarantee continuation of payment of benefits to civil servants who are not covered by the new scheme,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, drawing from the observations, the committee concluded that the current pay-as-you-go system is beset with numerous problems that signal the unsustainability of the system.\n\n\u201cThe economic depression in the country suggests that it can no longer support the smooth implementation of the existing system.\n\n\u201cThe paradigm shift of the policies that govern the pension landscape is the ultimate panacea to the lingering problems that beset the sector,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to the committee, the adoption of the Jigawa model will promote the objectives of the law.\n\nThe lawmakers, after an extensive debate on the issue, unanimously adopted the report and passed the bill for the introduction of the new pension scheme in the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Controversial American lobbyists are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to do the same, laundering IPOB\u2019s reputation in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cIPOB murder Nigerian citizens. They kill police officers and military personnel and set government property on fire.\n\n\u201cNow, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country. Were this group in a western country, you would not expect to hear Amnesty\u2019s full-throated defence of their actions.\n\n\u201cInstead, there would be silence or mealy-mouthed justification of western governments\u2019 action to check the spread of \u2018terrorism\u2019, the statement read in part.\n\nThe presidential aide also accused Amnesty International of playing local politics in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cDespite Amnesty\u2019s self-proclaimed mandate to impartially transcend borders, unfortunately in Nigeria they play only domestic politics.\n\n\u201cThe international NGO is being used as cover for the organisation\u2019s local leaders to pursue their self-interests.

Currently, we see none.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government will fight terrorism with all the means at its disposal.\n\n\u201cWe will ignore Amnesty\u2019s rantings.

          "title": "War without end on the Plateau",
          "text": "From Berom communities to Irigwe and Anaguta communities, ethno-religious violence in Plateau North Senatorial District has gone full cycle. KOLADE ADEYEMI x-rays the various dimensions of the conflicts\n\nFrom 1999, successive administrations in Plateau State have witnessed and managed ethno-religious violence. Even the military regimes that preceded the present democratic dispensation was not spared of bloodshed. For instance, the violence of 1994 in Jos North and the Gero riot in Jos South are still fresh in people\u2019s memory.\n\nThe administration of Joshua Dariye witnessed full-blown violence that led to an imposition of a state of emergency by the Olusegun Obasanjo-led Federal Government in 2004.\n\nWhile the bloodshed was on under the Dariye administration between 1999 and 2007, the opposition group led by Jonah Jang felt Dariye was the one fueling the violence. But, as God would have it, Jang became governor after Dariye. Plateau State witnessed one of the worst violence in the history of the state. The world has not forgotten the Dogo Nahawa massacre where over 300 citizens of the state were killed at midnight in 2010.\n\nIt was the massacre that would have necessitated another state of emergency, but instead the Federal Government opted for the establishment of a special military taskforce in Jos, the state capital in such a manner that showed the Jang-led state government had failed. It was under Jang government that a serving senator and House of Assembly members was killed at a mass burial site in Riyom local government in 2012.\n\nAgain, while it was happening under the Jonah Jang-led government, the Lalong-led political opposition group concluded that Jang was incapable of governing the state and was described as outright failure, especially in areas of security. Good enough, in 2015, the incumbent Lalong succeeded Jonah Jang with high expectations to end the insecurity in the state. Indeed, Gov Lalong performed some magic and stopped the bloodshed in the state soon as he became governor in 2015. But in spite of the initial achievements of Governor Lalong in peace-building, pockets of attacks and killings were concentrated in Berom communities.\n\nThe frequency of killings in Riyom and Barkin Ladi local governments prompted President Muhammadu Buhari to order the establishment of mobile police barrack in Gashish, so as to bring security closer to the vulnerable villagers. Even at that killings persist in Berom communities throughout the first tenure of Lalong.\n\nThe security situation under Lalong got the embarrassment of its profession when in 2018 while President Buhari was on a two-day state visit to Plateau State, gunmen invaded Bokkos community and Irigwe communities at the same time and killed over 30 residents.\n\nBeginning from 2018, attacks and killings somehow took a break from Berom communities and concentrated on Irigwe communities of Bassa Local Government. Records presented to newsmen by Irigwe Development Association indicated that more than 40 Irigwe villages have been sacked due to incessant attacks by gunmen.\n\nThe socio-cultural organisation also claimed more than 2,500 farmlands have been destroyed by the attackers and about 3,000 residents displaced from their homes. In the same vein Berom people are claiming that over 50 villages of their communities were attacked and are forcefully been occupied by the attackers.\n\nAn umbrella socio-cultural organization known as Plateau Our Heritage (POH) is of the view that the fundamental reason for continuous attacks and counterattacks across Plateau State has been group contesting over land. National Chairman of POH who is a former commissioner in the state, Alex Kwapnoe told The Nation on the phone that herders and farmers contesting for lands in the state remained the source of unending bloodshed.\n\nKwapnoe said his organization is yet to establish the allegations that the Federal Government\u2019s Fulanisation policy is being implemented in Plateau state. He said: \u201cIt is not clear to us yet if the conflict is about the suspected Fulanisation policy; we are still studying the situation, and once that suspicion is confirmed we shall make it public.\u201d\n\nThe Plateau State Director, Civil Liberty Organisation (CLO), Comrade Steve Aluko said violence still persist in Plateau due to lack of justice. He said: \u201cIt is not enough to arrest suspects; try them in court and get the punished by law. So, if we continue to witness the same kind of violence like this, then you know there is no justice.\u201d\n\nAluko said the declaration of curfew is not enough without the political will to enforce it, as cases abound which proves that many criminal elements are taking advantage of such policies to continue killing, maiming and committing other crimes. He said: \u201cBeyond the curfew government and other stakeholders must ensure tolerance, peaceful living and build bridges and confidence for sustainable harmonious coexistence relationship.\n\nMost recent episode of violence in Jos, the Plateau State capital suggests that efforts to bring about peace in the city have defiled solutions. From 2001 till date, all known and globally acclaimed peace options have been applied to bring lasting peace to the troubled city, but the results have not been commensurate with the much effort put in by the government and stakeholders. This has left citizens, government and concerned Nigerians wondering what next to do.\n\nAll ethnic nationalities signed a peace accord during the state of emergency in 2014, to co-exist in love and peace. It was even obvious at the end of that peace conference that the accord will not last because the Hausa-Muslim community refused to sign the agreement because of certain clauses in the document. The contentious clause was the disagreement over ownership of Jos city. The conference conferred ownership of Jos to the trio of Afizere, Anaguta and Berom. It also held that the other ethnic nationalities outside the three mentioned are settlers in Jos. That resolution left the Hausa community unhappy at the end of the peace conference and they refused to sign the peace agreement.\n\nThe administration of Governor Lalong has initiated all manners of reconciliation among these sworn enemies; he established the Plateau Peace Building Agency under the leadership of Joseph Lengmang. The state-owned Operation Rainbow established as a security outfit to complement government security agencies, which was also fortified and equipped by the governor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe European Union had intervened and established a peace architecture to bring all aggrieved parties together, using three different nongovernmental organizations; Search for Common Ground, Apurimac Onlus and Giz. These International organisations were satisfied after years of peace work and later handed over the peace processes to the citizens and left.\n\nIn spite of these efforts, love and peace is still a scarce commodity in Jos city. The recent attacks and counterattacks between the Christians and Muslims alluded to this fact that adherents of both religions have not been relating and ci-existing on the basis of love and peace.\n\nIt is obvious Jos residents hardly trust one another; Christians and Muslims are always suspicious of one another. Adherents of both religions preach tolerance but they font practice it and the recent attack alluded to this fact. The Public Relation Department of Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) in Plateau State said the recent conflict in Jos cannot be isolated from the nationwide insecurity. It said security personnel in the country are overwhelmed because the massive jobless youths are frustrated and can be employed or mobilised for violence.\n\nChief Executive Officer of a Jos-based private security outfit, Executive Guard, Edinen Usoro, said the security challenges being experienced in Jos is because the government has not taken definitive action on the issue of attacks in the state. In order words, no justice is done to victims. In every attack, even if it is one soul that is killed, the government is expected to deploy their intelligence system to get the attackers, expose and prosecute them. When that is done, the victims will not plan revenge.\n\nBut when attacks are concentrated in a particular location like Berom villages and now Miango villages and government do not arrest any attacker or prosecute them, the community will contemplate to help themselves, and when such self-help is allowed due to failure of government, then you have the kind of scenarios we are having in Jos.\n\nHe said governments at all levels have not shown any political will to manage the situation. He said: \u201cWhat has been going on in Plateau State has been basically terrorism; forces from outside the state have been carrying out terrorist acts against citizens of the state and government has not done enough to stop these acts of terrorism. People are tired of hearing consolatory words from the government each time they are attacked. The government will say calm down; cooperate with security agencies to handle the situation; investigation is on to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to book, etc. People are tired of hearing such words from the government; they want serious actions from their government not words of consolation.\u201d\n\nIf after each attack, government go after the attackers, apprehend them and prosecute them, people will not think of reprisals, these things will stop. Government need to do the needful to stop these cycle of violence in the state.\u201d\n\nCollaborating what Usoro said, a Member House of Representatives representing Pankshin, Kanam, Kanke Federal Constituency, Yusufu Adamu Gagdi also talked of the failure of the Buhari administration to use federal might to support Governor Lalong in managing Jos crisis.",

          "text": "Kissing is said to be a universally loved act.\n\nIt has also been proven scientifically that kissing has many health benefits. They vary from burning of calories and aiding in glowing up your skin among many other benefits.\n\nNow we do kiss pretty often in different forms. Sometimes we kiss our parents, our siblings, friends or even our special someone.\n\nIt is a very beautiful form of expressing love. At times when we can\u2019t find words to express, gestures like kissing always comes to the rescue.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t really know, every kiss has a different meaning to it. It is obvious that while kissing, you may not think of what it meant. But you could use this knowledge the next time your partner kisses you.\n\nYou will know what he expects or what his or her thoughts are.\n\nSo here we have listed down the 17 different types of kisses and their meaning for your utmost relish and enlightenment. You will be surprised know:\n\nAir kiss\n\nAir-kissing is a social gesture that involves pursing your lips and leaning in as if you\u2019re kissing, but without actually touching the other person\u2019s cheek (the little \u201cmwah\u201d sound is optional).\n\nIt can be a hello or a goodbye. It basically communicates endearment\u2014like, something you may do with a friend or family member when you\u2019re saying goodbye.\n\nBack kiss\n\nThis kiss means your partner wants more than just kisses.\n\nThe back kiss can be done only in a private space. It heats up the moment and things will escalate quickly.\n\nTry this kiss only if you are ready to take things forward.\n\nBite kiss\n\nKissing and playful biting on the lips, cheeks, jawline, collarbone, or neck can be really tantalising.\n\nWhile it makes for a seductive first-time hookup, introduce the idea slowly.\n\nGo easy to start and you\u2019ll know if it\u2019s well-received but if the person pulls back, then it\u2019s off the table.\n\nBody kiss\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBesides the neck, there are tons of other areas on the body worth kissing, including the chest, stomach, torso, feet, and booty. All this depends on an individual\u2019s sexual preferences and ticklish meter.\n\nRemember, what feels good to one person might not feel good to another.\n\nIf you really pay attention to your partner\u2019s body language, you\u2019re going to get a lot of information.\n\nButterfly kiss\n\nThe fluttering of butterfly and the batting of eyelids is synonymous.\n\nThe Butterfly kiss is cute and absolutely adorable. No lips are involved. The woman comes close to the man and presses her eyes on his face. The next step is to bat your eyelashes just like how a butterfly flies.\n\nThis kiss is more romantic than sexy. You both can also connect both your eyes and blink. The touch of the eyelashes is what makes this gesture adorable.\n\nRead Also: African men and kissing habits\n\nCheek kiss\n\nVery popular in Europe, one or two light kisses on the cheek is a friendly greeting that says \u201chappy to see you\u201d between friends, family, partners, and sometimes, strangers.\n\nBut when it happens with a romantic partner on a post-date, assume it\u2019s their respectful way of telling you \u201cthey had a great time, but want to take things slow.\u201d\n\nDrink kiss\n\nDo you have a date planned with your special someone? If yes, you must definitely try the \u2018Drink kiss\u2019.\n\nThis involves taking a sip of your favourite drink and kissing your partner to pass on the drink from your mouth.\n\nIt is unique and exciting right tells you are much comfortable with your partner and find them rally attractive.\n\nEar kiss\n\nMost women state that they love it when their partners kiss on the ears.

And kissing on the ears mean, the love is deep and intense.\n\nSo what are you waiting for now? If you have your partner right beside you, kiss him like there is no tomorrow and bring back the spark.\n\nEskimo kiss\n\nSome think it\u2019s corny but some couples love to rub noses because it\u2019s \u201ctheir thing\u201d and unique to their relationship.\n\nThere\u2019s no lip-touching in an Eskimo kiss but it\u2019s intimate without being sexual.\n\nForehead kiss\n\nThe forehead kiss is atypical, which makes it more memorable. Not only is it compassionate and warm, but it communicates love in a non-sexual way.\n\nThe gesture is typically reserved for someone special, like someone you\u2019re really feeling.\n\nFrench kiss\n\nThe open-mouth kiss with tongue is all types of erotic as there\u2019s almost no other kiss that connects two people more.\n\nLizard kiss\n\nThe Lizard kiss involves just tongues and that\u2019s it. The lizard kiss\n\nIt is an unconventional type of foreplay that intimate partners really find sexy and goes to show that they are into each other and want even more at that time.\n\nNeck kiss\n\nNeck kisses are highly depicted in movies and most often referenced in romantic novels but they\u2019re even more sensual in real life.\n\nThe neck is an underrated erogenous zone full of delicate, sensitive nerve endings, making for very fiery foreplay especially for women.\n\nRoyal hand kiss\n\nA person kissing the top of another\u2019s offered hand is the most formal of kisses.\n\nThe traditional ritual doesn\u2019t imply affection but it\u2019s more of a polite and respectful greeting among strangers meeting for the first time.\n\nSingle lip kiss\n\nThis seductive, warm-up move involves kissing the person\u2019s bottom lip while they kiss your top lip (or vice-versa).\n\nThe single lip kiss is a playful tease; an offer that maybe there\u2019s more to come.\n\nSpiderman kiss\n\nThe Spiderman kiss got its name from the movie. Since then it has become quite popular.\n\nIt is a kiss where the man\u2019s head is upside down and the lady kisses in that position.\n\nYou will feel your partner\u2019s breath and that makes the moment romantic and intense.\n\nStop and go kiss\n\nIf you are out for a long drive, this kiss should definitely be tried.\n\nOn your journey, whenever your vehicle halts at traffic point, just make the most of that moment and seize a passionate, quick kiss. It is pretty adventurous.",

This increase is as a result of the nationwide mandate to implement the Service Based Tariff approved by our regulators.\n\n\u201cKindly note that the increase will be reflected on the energy bill for October 2021, which will represent energy consumption for September.\n\n\u201cIn addition, for our metered customers with internal vending arrangements, we urge you to adjust the rates accordingly to reflect the new tariff increase as released by the NERC.\u201d\n\nAccording to the newly approved plan, customers with lower power consumption capacity have their rates increased by N2 per kilowatts hour from N54.08/kwh to N56.08/kwh and are promised at least 20 hours of supply daily.\n\nMD1 customers on Band A will pay N58.94/kwh from N56.94/kwh.\n\nHowever, Eko DisCo denied the notice, saying customers would be informed of any change on its website.\n\nBut reacting to the reports in a statement on Wednesday, Wabba cautioned that the Organised Labour would not brook any tarrifs hike.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe wish to draw your attention to the wave of speculation, especially as widely reported in the media that there are fresh plans to grant approval to Electricity Distribution Companies to hike electricity tariff.\n\n\u201cWe write to remind the Honourable Minister that Organised Labour on September 28, 2020, through the Federal Government \u2013 Organised Labour Committee on Electricity Tariff agreed to freeze further increases in electricity tariff until the committee concludes its work and its report adopted by all the Principals in the Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is in light of this that we dismiss the ongoing speculation on increase in electricity tariff as mere speculations.\n\n\u201cWe, however, find it prudent to put you on notice that should government make true the swirling speculation by approving an increase in electricity tariff, Organised Labour would be left with no option than to deploy the industrial mechanisms granted in our laws for the defense of workers\u2019 rights.\u201d",

          "text": "As Buhari charges new board to invest more for economic diversification\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, has disclosed that the net assets of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) have increased from $1 billion in 2015 to $3.5 billion in 2021.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari charged the new board of the Authority to make more investments to boost the nation\u2019s economic diversification.\n\nZainab, who spoke Wednesday at the inauguration of the third board of NSIA at the State House, Abuja, said from the base position of $1 billion when the administration assumed office in 2015, NSIA now has around $3.5 billion in assets under management.\n\nShe explained that the Board will, on behalf of the Nigerian people, guide and oversee the NSIA management\u2019s activities towards delivering outcomes to transform the fortunes of the country.\n\nShe said: \u201cUsing the NSIA Act as its guide, the Board will be required to superintend initiatives that meet the current and future needs of Nigerians.\n\n\u2018\u2018On our part as government, we will continue to support the Authority with the necessary policies and framework to ensure that the mission of the institution is delivered in a transparent, sustainable and inclusive manner.\u201d\n\nSpeaking while inaugurating the nine-man board, President Buhari charged the new board of NSIA to make more investments that support economic diversification, as global oil prices are projected to drop to around $40 per barrel by 2030.\n\nThe president reaffirmed his administration\u2019s commitment to implementing long term projects and programmes that create jobs for Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that the full impact of most of the strategic projects started under his watch will only be felt long after he leaves office.\n\nThe president described the appointment of the board as a call to duty, action and performance, adding that they were eminently qualified for the job.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis government operates on the agenda for long term change which we all agree is inevitable. Change happens whether you are ready for it or not.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the federation, you are required to continue to drive the performance of the Authority to deliver benefits to all Nigerians.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must bear in mind that the National Economic Council, your governing council and Nigerians as a whole will hold you accountable for this mandate. Periodically, you will be required to provide evidence of your stewardship at the governing council meetings where your performance will be assessed.\n\n\u2018\u2018The bar before you is very high and all of us are counting on you to deliver. If you do, I assure you that government and indeed all Nigerians will be unflinching in their support for you.\u201d\n\nThe president recalled that NSIA, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s premier economic institutions, was conceived to be a store of wealth which may be drawn upon at times of economic challenges thereby encouraging external investors and lenders.\n\nHe expressed delight that so far, the institution has discharged its mandate dutifully.\n\n\u201cThis is why we prioritized the appointment of a new board to ensure that the Authority does not lose steam and can continue to benefit from the oversight it needs to deliver on its mandate.\n\n\u201cThe new board we assembled has a crop of seasoned, eminently qualified, and experienced professionals. We expect these individuals to bring their wealth of experience to bear in the next phase of NSIA\u2019s journey,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also appreciated the last board of directors whose tenure ended in May 2021.\n\nAcknowledging their commitment, dedication and contributions to the implementation of the objectives of the Authority, the president said: \u2018\u2018This distinguished group of patriotic Nigerians heeded the call to serve and deployed the best of their abilities to oversee the affairs of the Authority on behalf of the nation over the last four years.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari stressed that the immediate past board guided the organisation through a critical stage of its existence and have left it standing as a credible world class institution that turns out consistently good results.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis administration took the very difficult decision to invest for the long term. We avoided taking short cuts knowing very well that the full impact of most of the projects we started will only be felt long after we have left office.\n\n\u2018\u2018Accordingly, in the past four years, both the public and private sectors in Nigeria have partnered on strategic projects with the NSIA.\n\n\u2018\u2018On the public sector partnership, we are working with the NSIA on strategic infrastructure projects such as the Second Niger Bridge, the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Express Way and the Abuja \u2013 Kano Road, to mention a few.\n\n\u2018\u2018On the private sector collaborations, we have projects such as the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative, the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Initiative and the NSIA Healthcare Development and Investment Company, amongst many.\n\n\u2018\u2018Although these projects and programmes have immediately created jobs from a development standpoint, the wider impact on society will only be felt in years to come.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe new board members are Farouk Mohammed Gumel (North-west) as Non-Executive Chairman; Sir Babatunde Sobamowo (Sout-west), Non-Executive Director; Isiekwena Ikemefuna Louis (South-south), Non-Executive Director; Ali Goni Kadugum (North-east), Non-Executive Director; Oniyangi Kabir Sulaiman (North-central), Non-Executive Director; and Ike Chioke (South-east), Non-Executive Director.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A lawyer attached to the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT), Nosa Uhumwangho, has explained how the embattled 'Super Cop', Abba Kyari, made him pay the proceed from a hotel owned by an alleged kidnap kingpin into his account.\n\n\n\nUhumwangho stated this while appearing before the Nigerian Bar Association Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (LPDC) on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawyer said Kyari told him to pay the sum of N3, 075, 300, which was generated from De-English hotel, Enugu and another property at 21, Edinburgh Street, owned by late Collins Ezenwa also known as E-Money, an alleged kidnapper, into his (Uhumwangho's) bank.\n\n\n\nKyari, who was suspended from the Nigerian Police Force, is under investigation after an indictment by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over his relationship with a popular fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly called Hushpuppi.\n\n\n\nHe has denied the allegations of corruption leveled against him.\n\nSee Also Police Hushpuppi: Suspended DCP Abba Kyari Appears Fourth Time Before Inspector-General\u2019s Panel, Grilled For Hours\n\nBut in a 131 paragraph affidavit on 30 June 2021, and submitted to the NBA\u2019s LPDC, obtained by Sahara Reporters, Uhumwangho said Kyari had authorized him to pay the money into his Zenith Bank personal account for \u201creasons best known to them\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe lawyer also stated in the affidavit that Kyari\u2019s team had previously instructed Tochukwu Okeke, a notorious cult member to collect rents from properties owned by late Ezenwa on his behalf.\n\n\n\nOkeke is currently being detained at the 82 Division of the Nigerian army over his alleged sponsorship of members of the Indigenous People of Biafra in the southeast.\n\n\n\nOkeke, who refused to appear before the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) panel investigating the activities of SARS, had claimed that he paid $2 million ransom to late Ezenwa\u2019s gang after he was kidnapped in 2016.\n\nSee Also Police Hushpuppi: Police Panel Submits \u2018Damning Report\u2019 On Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari\n\nUhumwangho was dragged to the NBA disciplinary committee by a lawyer and human rights activist, Justice Ijeoma, for \u201cconduct unbecoming of a legal practitioner\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn his petition to the NBA-LDPC, Ijeoma alleged that Uhumagho, acting in cahoots with other police officers attached to the Inspector General of Police \u2013Intelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT), criminally converted the properties of his client.\n\n\n\nUhumagho, under cross-examination by Ijeoma\u2019s lead counsel, Max Ogar, admitted paying the money into his personal account based on the directive of his boss, Abba Kyari.\n\n\n\nIn a letter dated 28 January 2019 obtained by Sahara Reporters, Abba Kyari wrote, \u201c The National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria (Presidential Panel on SARS Reforms) which sat in Abuja on 25th January, 2019, directed the Legal Officer of IGP-IRT to recover money in possession of any person controlling the aforesaid properties and make them render account.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Hushpuppi: Police Panel Recommends Demotion For Disgraced DCP, Abba Kyari To Prevent His Extradition To US\n\n\u201cIn view of the above-stated fact, you are hereby directed/ordered to recover any money therefrom and take possession and make sure it is properly kept and safe in your custody, because if paid into the Police account, it will be difficult to recover it and tender it before the court as the matter is still pending at the Honourable Federal High Court, Owerri Judicial Division. The court may make demand for it in the nearest future.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your patriotic zeal in serving the Nigeria Police Force and your motherland to the best of your ability and capability. Accept the assurance of my high esteem regard.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, sources from the NHRC panel, which sat between 14th and 26th January 2019, denied authorizing Kyari to collect any money on late Ezenwa\u2019s property and pay into a private account.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Amnesty International and National Human Rights Commission accused Kyari of illegally depleting assets of Collins Ezenwa who was illegally executed by SARS in Owerri, Imo State.\n\n\n\nCollins Ezenwa\u2019s wife told the NHRC panel that Kyari and his team withdrew money from her late husband\u2019s bank account, seized his cars for their private use and pocketed millions in accommodation proceeds from his hotels and properties.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Human Rights Commission said in an October 2018 petition to the then Inspector-General, Ibrahim Idris, that the IRT, led by Abba Kyari, a deputy police commissioner, had depleted the asset of Collins Ezenwa, a suspected kidnapper who was gunned down in January 2018.\n\n\n\nKyari had said Ezenwa was a notorious kidnapper who had committed untold atrocities before he was killed.\n\n\n\nThe police in Imo State accused Ezenwa, a former police corporal, of leading a syndicate of deadly abductors. He was killed during an exchange of gunfire along the Enugu-Owerri Expressway.\n\n\n\nKyari and his team members were said to have taken over Ezenwa's properties worth billions of naira.\n\n\n\nA hotel linked to Ezenwa in Enugu was estimated at N220,000,000. He also had two duplexes and eight blocks of flats worth a combined N180 million, according to the NHRC petition.\n\n\n\nThe victim, who was a police corporal before he resigned, also had a fleet of exotic vehicles. Other properties of Ezenwa have also been identified in Imo and Abia states, estimating his worth in billions.",

          "text": "Yemi Kale, former statistician-general of the federation, says he \u201cnever said\u201d he was pressured to publish false data on the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKale spoke to TheCable on Wednesday in reaction to reports that he said he fought off pressure to put out inaccurate data during his tenure in office.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on The Morning Show on Arise TV, Kale was asked how he handled attacks and criticism from government officials when data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) were unfavourable.\n\nIn response, he said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely stubborn which a few of my friends have said is a good requirement for the job. But on a serious note, when I started this job, I remember mentioning to my key staff that if I am going to do this job right, I must be ready to be fired at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you go to my previous office, I never really settled down properly because I expected that anytime, I could be removed. And that was the price I was prepared to pay for trying to do the job properly.\n\n\u201cI had to convince myself that it is just a job. I\u2019m serving my country and I will serve it correctly and I\u2019m ready to lose my job for doing the right things. I am not ready to keep my job for doing the wrong things.\n\n\u201cOnce I convinced myself that that\u2019s the way it was going to go, I didn\u2019t particularly care about any political attacks or any opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll I did was to ensure that we followed the correct methodology. Before the report came out, I was very hands-on because I knew that if anyone found any mistakes, they can use that against me. I would check every single thing to ensure that things are done properly. Once I\u2019m very confident about it, it goes out.\n\n\u201cIn terms of political interference, I don\u2019t think it is new to Nigeria. I remember even in the US, the former President Trump would always agree with the good data, and say the ones he didn\u2019t like, he didn\u2019t believe they were correct.\n\n\u201cSo I wasn\u2019t fazed by different comments made by different people that did not agree. We are supposed to publish data that is correct and accurate in line with what comes out on the field and that\u2019s exactly what we focused on.\u201d\n\nKale told TheCable that at no time during the interview did he make the comment on data falsification attributed to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that a publication is quoting Dr. Yemi Kale wrongly, this is fake news and should be ignored. We have confirmed that the former Statistician-General (Kale) never made this statement, the general public should take note,\u201d a statement made available to TheCable reads.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on August 26 approved the appointment of Simon B. Harry to replace Kale as the new statistician-general of the federation to head the NBS.\n\nKale\u2019s second term tenure of five years expired on August 16, 2021.",

          "text": "Yemi Kale, former statistician-general of the federation, says he \u201cnever said\u201d he was pressured to publish false data on the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKale spoke to TheCable on Wednesday in reaction to reports that he said he fought off pressure to put out inaccurate data during his tenure in office.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on The Morning Show on Arise TV, Kale was asked how he handled attacks and criticism from government officials when data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) were unfavourable.\n\nIn response, he said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely stubborn which a few of my friends have said is a good requirement for the job. But on a serious note, when I started this job, I remember mentioning to my key staff that if I am going to do this job right, I must be ready to be fired at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you go to my previous office, I never really settled down properly because I expected that anytime, I could be removed. And that was the price I was prepared to pay for trying to do the job properly.\n\n\u201cI had to convince myself that it is just a job. I\u2019m serving my country and I will serve it correctly and I\u2019m ready to lose my job for doing the right things. I am not ready to keep my job for doing the wrong things.\n\n\u201cOnce I convinced myself that that\u2019s the way it was going to go, I didn\u2019t particularly care about any political attacks or any opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll I did was to ensure that we followed the correct methodology. Before the report came out, I was very hands-on because I knew that if anyone found any mistakes, they can use that against me. I would check every single thing to ensure that things are done properly. Once I\u2019m very confident about it, it goes out.\n\n\u201cIn terms of political interference, I don\u2019t think it is new to Nigeria. I remember even in the US, the former President Trump would always agree with the good data, and say the ones he didn\u2019t like, he didn\u2019t believe they were correct.\n\n\u201cSo I wasn\u2019t fazed by different comments made by different people that did not agree. We are supposed to publish data that is correct and accurate in line with what comes out on the field and that\u2019s exactly what we focused on.\u201d\n\nKale told TheCable that at no time during the interview did he make the comment on data falsification attributed to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that a publication is quoting Dr. Yemi Kale wrongly, this is fake news and should be ignored. We have confirmed that the former Statistician-General (Kale) never made this statement, the general public should take note,\u201d a statement made available to TheCable reads.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on August 26 approved the appointment of Simon B. Harry to replace Kale as the new statistician-general of the federation to head the NBS.\n\nKale\u2019s second term tenure of five years expired on August 16, 2021.",

This variant is known as 21H in Nextstrain nomenclature,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cThe Mu variant has a constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape. Preliminary data presented to the Virus Evolution Working Group show a reduction in neutralisation capacity of convalescent and vaccinee sera similar to that seen for the Beta variant, but this needs to be confirmed by further studies.\n\n\u201cSince its first identification in Colombia in January 2021, there have been a few sporadic reports of cases of the Mu variant and some larger outbreaks have been reported from other countries in South America and in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs of 29 August, over 4500 sequences (3794 sequences of B.1.621 and 856 sequences of B.1.621.1) have been uploaded to GISAID from 39 countries. Although the global prevalence of the Mu variant among sequenced cases has declined and is currently below 0.1%, the prevalence in Colombia (39%) and Ecuador (13%) has consistently increased.\n\n\u201cThe reported prevalence should be interpreted with due consideration of sequencing capacities and timeliness of sharing of sequences, both of which vary between countries.

          "title": "Fintech Focus: The link between Open Banking and financial inclusion",
          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

One of them is Bantu, an Africa-led company that develops Blockchain infrastructures.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t the CBN choose from Nigeria?\n\nIn CBN\u2019s defence, Chuta believes local technical partners might not be the best option given that the Blockchain network \u2014 Hyperledger Fabric \u2014 the CBN chose to run the eNaira is created by a consortium of \u201cbig entities including IBM and a couple of other big organisations that are not local.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, he points out that the CBN did not leave Nigerian companies out.\n\n\u201cThere is a team of Nigerians, an Africa-based company called Interstellar that has a functional Blockchain infrastructure deployed for the CBN on a testnet that is still running.\u201d\n\nWhy did the CBN choose Hyperledger Fabric?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Hyperledger Fabric was chosen as the Blockchain solution for the eNaira, but Chuta believes the apex bank has good reasons for making the decision.\n\nNevertheless, he has reservations about the solution, as it\u2019s his opinion that Hyperledger Fabric is a closed Blockchain infrastructure, \u201cwhich may not be easy for the kind of innovation that we have previously advised the CBN on.\u201d\n\nChuta advised the CBN on creating a Blockchain solution that not only serves the eNaira but a variety of other things such as identity management and supply chain management, basically killing several birds with one stone.\n\n\u201cBantu Blockchain is an Africa-led Blockchain team that could have built what CBN wants.\u201d\n\nWith the availability of African and Nigerian companies competent enough to provide the services Bitt Inc is offering, does CBN truly have a genuine reason to look outward?\n\nKeep your eyes peeled to this article as we\u2019ll be sharing more updates from industry players and experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.",

          "title": "\u201cAngel investing is more than just writing a cheque\u201d \u2014 Biola Alabi, Nollywood producer and tech investor",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartup investing in Africa has come a long way, and this is partly due to the work that angel investors do in helping startups take off. As their name suggests, angel investors are individuals who provide early-stage financing for startups that helps them get their business off the ground and hopefully attract bigger investments.\n\nBecause they invest at the very early stages of a startup\u2019s life, the chances of failure are really high, yet without the money they invest, many startups may never get started.\n\nFor today\u2019s instalment in the Angels and VC series, Techpoint Africa spoke to Biola Alabi, an angel investor and the founder of Biola Alabi Media, a company that produces film and television content. If you\u2019ve watched Nollywood movies such as Lara and the Beat, Banana Island Ghosts, and Bukas and Joints, then you have her company to thank for it.\n\nCan you give us a brief history of your professional experience?\n\nMy career has seen me work in different industries. I started out working in the automotive sector before moving to startups and then media. Working in the media was actually what led to me returning to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I started working in Africa, I became more obsessed with impact. So for me, if I was going to leave the US to return to Africa, anything I did had to be impactful.\n\nThere was no point in being here if I was not going to make an impact. Currently, I run a strategic and advisory company that also produces film and television content.\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nFor me, it was really about investing in people. There were people with good ideas who often asked me to invest, but I always thought of formalising the process.\n\nThe founder of Big Cabal Media reached out to me on Twitter for a meeting, during which he told me about what they wanted to do and where they planned to go with the business.\n\nAt that time, I was a subscriber to TechCabal\u2018s newsletter. Having been a part of a tech ecosystem, I knew that reporting on ecosystems was important for building one.\n\nI was really interested in what they were doing and the fact that they were going to be Pan-African, so I wrote a cheque for them. I believe I was one of the first people who did that, and that sort of started my journey.\n\nOnce again, it was always about what the company was doing, if they were solving a pain point or creating jobs for young people on the continent and Nigeria. These were all things that were important to me. After Big Cabal Media, I started looking at tech companies to learn more about the tech ecosystem here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiola Alabi. Source: Supplied\n\nI visited CcHUB and got involved with Lagos Angel Network (LAN) because I also wanted to learn more about angel investing from an educational perspective, and LAN was a great place to do that. There\u2019s so much around angel investing. It\u2019s not just about writing a cheque; it\u2019s also about rolling up your sleeves and helping the entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a lot of learning to do, and I think I learnt a lot from my first investments.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned impact, but what else motivates you?\n\nWell, angel investing is literally about people; it\u2019s about investing in people who have a good idea. So part of how I see my role as an angel investor is in terms of how I can help the company grow and the value I can bring to them.\n\nSometimes there are companies where you don\u2019t have the opportunity to roll up your sleeves and get involved. I\u2019ve made some of these investments and found that I don\u2019t enjoy them as much as companies where I\u2019m helping out.\n\nAt the end of the day, we\u2019re angel investors and not executives, but if we can help the executives in the company strategise, think differently, and open our network to them, I believe that\u2019s when we\u2019re adding real value.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve worked in roles that have required me to add value to companies from a strategic perspective to grow portfolios within companies. These are things in my wheelhouse, so I\u2019m very excited if I can bring them to a startup.\n\nI\u2019m also excited when we can build corporate governance into their systems. As early-stage startups, they need to start to think very early about how to ensure that the business is structured correctly. Hence, structuring businesses is something I enjoy doing too.\n\nAngel investing is really about making a change. Of course, long term, hopefully, we make some profit, but that\u2019s not what drives me. While angel investing is part of my investment portfolio, it is not a core part. I only invest money that I don\u2019t mind losing, and we need more people to invest in early-stage startups on the continent.\n\nAre there specific industries that you\u2019re interested in, and why?\n\nThere are things that I\u2019m interested in, but sometimes, that\u2019s also not what drives my investments. For some, it could be that the market is not large enough or that I don\u2019t think the solution is something that we need right now. I\u2019m interested in the health sector, but sometimes I see businesses and don\u2019t invest in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiola Alabi. Source: Supplied\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the leadership because I believe that you need a great team to grow and scale a company. They don\u2019t necessarily need to have all the right answers, but I really have to believe in the team.\n\nFor some businesses, it\u2019s just about how passionate I am about the solution. I might not necessarily know the big picture, and they might have to pivot a few times in their journey, but the fact that they were thinking about solving a very difficult problem can sometimes motivate me to write a cheque.\n\nI am very decisive because I\u2019ve learnt that the sooner you can decide as an investor, the better for you so that you don\u2019t waste your time or the entrepreneur\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in health and education; in the past, I\u2019ve worked with a company committed to using media to educate.\n\nI\u2019m currently working with an edutech company, and they\u2019re building some really cool and exciting stuff. Anything that saves or preserves life, can move our health system forward, or eliminate a lot of the friction that exists in our financial system is interesting to me.\n\nAre you like most angel investors who invest at the early stage?\n\nAngel investing is really early stage. We come in very early so that you can go out and prove to bigger investors that you have a product people are willing to pay for. Sometimes we come in at the idea stage, especially if you\u2019re a first-time founder, but that\u2019s rare. Most, if not all, investments I\u2019ve done have been in companies with at least a minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nBy your standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI think one of the things a startup should not be doing is hide its challenges from investors. So startups usually have challenges, and a lot of the time, they only give you the good news.\n\nI try to advise startups to show the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of their business. They should be able to ask for help when they need it, so startups need to be as transparent as possible.\n\nEven if things are going badly, you should not ghost your investors. Keep them informed because it\u2019s a very small community and word travels very quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019re a founder, you never know when an investor is capable of helping you. Also, when making demands from investors, be very clear. Angel investors are busy, but they want to help, so make it easier for them to do that by being specific.\n\nWhat\u2019s your average ticket size for a company?\n\nThe cheques vary in size depending on where the entrepreneur is in their journey and where I think the company is. I\u2019ve written cheques for $5,000 all the way to $25,000. Currently, I\u2019m going out of my comfort zone and writing larger cheques.\n\nWhat companies do you have in your portfolio?\n\nChekkit, Big Cabal Media, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Trove, and a few others, which I won\u2019t disclose.\n\nHave you had any bad investments so far?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call them bad investments, but there\u2019ve been a few that haven\u2019t worked out. The company just wasn\u2019t the right company at the right time, and with those companies, you take it on the chin and move on. For some of these companies, I\u2019ve stayed in touch with the founders and have explored investing in new projects that they are working on.\n\nWhat are some of your significant wins?\n\nOne of the most notable stories for us has been Big Cabal Media and the transition from the founder who was also the CEO to a new CEO. So the founders wanted to move on to something else and had to be replaced. I\u2019m the chairwoman of the board, and that phase needed to be handled well.\n\nSuccession planning was not something we thought about before then, but it\u2019s something I now encourage founders to consider. You never know if you want to move on to something else or if you are the right fit for the stage at which the company is. Being able to pull it off successfully is something that I\u2019m incredibly proud of.\n\nAre there opportunities that you regret passing on?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I regret the opportunities I\u2019ve passed on because I try to learn from them. I\u2019m an angel investor, and that means I invest my money. I have a budget that I work with, and sometimes I pass on some deals because my budget does not cover them. One of the things that you must have as an angel investor is discipline so that you don\u2019t get burnt out.\n\nOccasionally, I go over my budget, but I try not to overstretch myself. I enjoy what I do, and if I start to overstretch myself, I might not enjoy it as much. When I see some of these deals that I cannot invest in, I try to introduce them to other angel investors that I know.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nI\u2019m very active on Twitter and LinkedIn, and I\u2019m open to having a chat with anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nA few days ago, I saw a tweet asking how people described their job to older family members. For a lot of people, especially in the tech industry, that\u2019s a tough ask. In Nigeria, for example, only a decade ago, it was unheard of to be a product manager. You were either a lawyer, doctor, engineer, accountant, or a failure.\n\nFor Nifemi Akinwamide, Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi, the decision to study metallurgical and materials engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) had more to do with his desire to satisfy his parents than any interest in the course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn intervention from his guardian a few years after he got into school helped put him on his current path. Making the switch to study project management meant he could use his strengths adequately.\n\nIn this interview with our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, he shares some of the lessons he has learnt on his journey. Trust me, you want to read this. Also, could you take a few seconds to invite your friends to subscribe to this newsletter? Perks?

Source: Supplied\n\nPan-African VC firm, LoftyInc Capital, has announced a $10 million fund for African entrepreneurs. The fund, its third, has limited partners like FBNQuest Funds, high-net-worth individuals from Facebook, Google, and Exxon Mobil, syndicates from the Green Investment Club, and Andela CEO, Jeremy Johnson.\n\nSince launching in 2012, the firm has invested in over 50 startups, including Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, Andela, Akiba Digital, and TechAdvance. With the launch of this fund, LoftyInc wants to take big bets on startups outside Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt.\n\nA month ago, we spoke to Idris Bello, Managing Partner at LoftyInc, and he shared some insights into the firm\u2019s investment philosophy. You can read all about it here.\n\nIn a chat with TechCrunch, Bello revealed that the firm\u2019s successful exit from Flutterwave catalysed launching its third fund. With his experience investing in African startups, one may argue that a $10 million fund is small. However, he does not appear to be in a hurry, preferring instead to grow gradually.\n\nPointing out that a good number of the limited partners in the third fund hold C-level positions in multinationals, he argued that delivering good returns would pave the way for onboarding the institutions where they work.\n\nWhile African startups have continued to receive more money from investors, a significant portion of these funds comes from foreign investors. However, there is an increasing number of local investors willing to bet on African startups. As more successes are recorded, more local investors would be open to investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBN reveals who will design the eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eNaira will launch on the 1st of October, 2021\n\nIn line with its plans to pilot a digital currency, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed its choice of Bitt Inc as the technical partner for developing the eNaira.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, August 30, 2021, Godwin Emefiele, CBN Governor, listed the benefits of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to include accelerated financial inclusion, increased cross-border trade, payment systems efficiency and cheaper and faster remittances.\n\nExplaining the choice of Bitt Inc, Osita Nwanisobi, CBN spokesperson, said, \u201cThe CBN will rely on the company\u2019s tested and proven digital currency experience which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.\u201d\n\nBarbados-based Bitt Inc is a fintech company with some experience developing CBDCs, having developed DCash for the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in April.\n\nIn February 2021, CBN prohibited commercial banks from providing financial services to cryptocurrency exchanges. However, in an interesting turn of events, the apex bank announced in July that the pilot scheme of a digital currency for the country would begin in October.\n\nAs cryptocurrency has gained widespread acceptance among many individuals, most governments have unanimously objected to its legitimacy. This could be because, unlike legal tender, cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any individual.\n\nHowever, in what seems to be a case of \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them,\u201d apex banks globally are making plans for their own digital currencies. In Africa, for example, Ghana, Morocco, Tunisia, Kenya, and Madagascar are some of the countries looking into the creation of digital currencies.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhy Intelligent Minds Like Jeff Bezos Embrace the \u2018Rule of Writing.\u2019 Read.\n\nWhy You Need to Protect Your Sense of Wonder \u2014 Especially Now.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and his counterparts in Oyo and Abia States, Engr. Seyi Makinde and Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, respectively, on Tuesday, flagged off the e-registration and Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise in Anambra State, ahead of the November 6, 2021 date for the state\u2019s gubernatorial poll.\n\nObaseki, who is also the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) e-Registration Committee, expressed confidence that the PDP will emerge victorious in the forthcoming election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAnambra State is the first state that we are launching the e-registration and CVR exercise as we were charged, as the committee on e-registration, to commence the exercise following the forthcoming election on November 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned and have seen, PDP is the only party in Nigeria. Other parties are Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) for elections. Our party\u2019s strength rests on the ward. It\u2019s the base of the party and the e-registration launch today will be driven by the leadership of the 326 wards in Anambra State.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exercise, we can register you in our portal as PDP members and also register you with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) if you are not a voter. The process is very simple,\u201d he noted.\n\nStating the importance of the exercise in the nation\u2019s electoral process, Obaseki noted that e-registration would make it impossible and difficult to rig the election as against the former practice of writing result in collation centers.\n\nHe urged PDP members to take the e-registration exercise seriously to boost membership as it will create room for the party to win the election, adding, \u201cWe must join the PDP to stop the hardship in the country; like high cost of food, the killings and havoc from herdsmen, bandits and robbers. Our e-registration is the right planning for the party as the exercise will further showcase the greatness of our party.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Makinde noted: \u201cI am from the South-West. Obaseki is from the South-South, and Ikpeazu came from the South-East; you have the full support of the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf I can win election with just one member in the Oyo State House of Assembly, you can also do the same. Don\u2019t be discouraged. With the e-registration, it will be difficult to write results. They couldn\u2019t rig the Edo election; they can\u2019t also do it here. We will all rejoice come November 6, 2021 after the governorship election.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu charged the party members to embrace the registration exercise, adding, \u201cWe must come out en-masse to register from the comfort of our homes. The process is easy. No time to stand back but stand firm to stop the suffering and hardship in the nation by supporting PDP all the way to 2023.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice-Presidential candidate of the PDP, Dr. Peter Obi, commended the governors of Edo, Oyo and Abia states for coming to support the party\u2019s guber candidate, Valentine Ozigbo.\n\n...",

These figures are encouraging and of the online registrants 2,160,292 are youths between ages 18 to 34,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nShe added that recently, INEC expanded polling units by creating additional 57,023 units across the country, bringing the total units to 176,996, with the aim of bringing the voting process closer to the people .\n\nProf. Adebayo Olukoshi, Chairman, The Electoral Forum and Professor, Wits School of Governance, in South Africa, commended the forum for the initiative to gather veterans with knowledgeable insights on the electoral process.\n\nOlukoshi said that the world over it was believed that interacting with such a class of people would help in improving the quality of governance, elections and democracy.\n\nHe said that issues of electoral integrity had continued to plague Nigeria, so, there was need to commit to working at ensuring electoral integrity, so that citizens could reap the dividends of democracy .\n\nMs Princess Hamman-Obels, Director, IRIAD, The Electoral Hub, said that the Hub conceptualised the Electoral Forum as a way to pool resource persons from electoral management bodies together with other electoral stakeholders.\n\nThis, Hamman-Obels said, was to find solutions to the unique problems facing the electoral process in Nigeria .\n\n\u201cWith the support of OSIWA, the forum has been established under the chairmanship of Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, and other high-calibre practitioners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by facilitating discussions among different stakeholders, we hope to deepen understanding of the electoral process in Nigeria, as well as provide solutions to improve electoral integrity and credibility,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nHamman-Obels said that the aim of the forum was to facilitate systematic electoral reforms, promote evidence-based law-making, policy and advocacy on elections in Nigeria.\n\nShe added that another objective of the forum was also to advance strategies to improve capacities and credibility of electoral management bodies in Nigeria.\n\nToday\u2019s public launch and inaugural meeting\u2019s objective was to formally launch the forum, determine its operations, produce understanding of members and review the Electoral Amendment bill, she said.\n\nMs Catherine Angai, Programme Coordinator, Democracy and Accountability, OSIWA, said that the support to Electoral Hub, spoke to OSIWA\u2019s priority for evidence-based electoral reforms.\n\nAngai added that it targeted those factors that impacted on electoral integrity, particularly the administrative barriers, and that the project had a research component which would critically analyse Nigeria\u2019s election management system.\n\nShe said that the research would create a compelling evidence-based narrative that presented a clear picture of the strengths and limitations of electoral bodies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the project fills a major knowledge-gap and provides an expose into the structural issues that have impacted on the work of electoral management bodies over the years,\u2019\u2019 she said.

This is particularly important given that the next generation of investors are typically on their mobile phones, and until we can meet them there the value we can deliver to them will be limited. Over the next few months, we expect to deliver some positive structural changes building on our existing activities in this regard.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that the Exchange is looking at strategies as to how to attract more foreign capital.\n\n\u201cWhile attracting foreign capital is largely based on the macroeconomic environment of the nation, NGX continues to address factors within its immediate control to provide a conducive environment for these investments. We recognise that investors look into the quality of the companies and asset classes available before making investment decisions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs such, we place significant emphasis on governance, as well as the rules guiding the behavior of Issuers in our market. On the trading side, we also consider factors around the ease in settling transactions, resolving complaints, finding the right infrastructure and engaging the right intermediaries\u201d\n\nSpeaking to trading in the market, Popoola noted that the increase in domestic participation on NGX in few months is a testament of the financial power of Nigeria as a whole while adding that the Exchange will look to drive local participation and at the same time, position itself to attract investments.\n\nIn concluding, Popoola expressed his excitement about the future of The Exchange especially with the possibilities advancements in technology provide.\n\n\u201cWe may not be able to wrap our minds around the potential that technology will open up to us, but I am confident that the Exchange of the future is one that will offer a diversified range of capital raising opportunities, as well as sophisticated investment products that meet stakeholders\u2019 needs,\u201d he stated.",

The family did not want me, and some people brought religion into it. They said how can Useni, a Christian be allowed to succeed Abacha? I was sidelined but I didn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\nNarrating what transpired after Abacha\u2019s death, Useni said he was not aware of the death until about nine hours later, because some people did not want him to know.\n\n\u201cI got a call at about 10am that there was a security council meeting. I said I was not aware. When I went eventually, the soldiers at the gate did not allow me to enter. I was surprised, such thing had never happened before. I didn\u2019t know at the time that Abacha was dead.\n\n\u201cIt was while I was at the gate that another soldier came and asked them to open the gate for me; that Abacha was lying dead. He threatened to shoot if they didn\u2019t open the gate for me. That was how I managed to enter.\n\n\u201cWhen I went in I saw service chiefs already there. I was the last person to be informed to attend the meeting.\u201d\n\nRecalling the person Abacha was, Useni who was also military governor of the defunct Bendel State from January 1984 to August 1985, insisted that he was not corrupt as people think he was.\n\n\u201cAbacha was not a criminal; he was not as bad as people make him out to be.

          "text": "The federal government has rolled out the last component of the Survival Fund programme known as the Guaranteed Off-take Scheme (GOS).\n\nGovernment said the purpose of the GOS is to stimulate direct local production by enabling 100,000 MSMEs in the production sector with funds to produce \u2018post COVID lockdown\u2019 off-take products.\n\nThese products include: face masks, hand sanitisers, liquid soap, disinfectants and processed foods such as garri, palm oil, groundnut oil, and spices.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMinister of state for Industry, trade and investment, Amb. Maryam Katagum, at a briefing on Wednesday in Abuja, while observing that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a drop in demand for corporate and household products and commodities in the country, said the scheme is giving preference to products produced in reasonably sufficient volumes in each state which have proven propensity to create jobs and have a multiplier effect on the surrounding economy.\n\nKatagum disclosed that out of the initial target of 100,000 MSMEs across the country, government received 65,976 applications across the country by the time the portal closed out of which it verified and pre-qualified 50,032 MSMEs that are presently being processed to off-take their products.\n\nShe added that potential beneficiaries in the 36 states and FCT were invited to apply via the Survival Fund Portal and applications were verified in line with the project\u2019s approved criteria such as: Nigerian citizenship; registration in Nigeria, with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC); verifiable BVN of business owner; staff of no less than three persons\n\nThe minister explained that government has successfully carried out a mapping of products produced in sufficient quantities in each state of the federation and the FCT, adding that at the end of the off-take process, items procured would be handed over to the state governments for onward distribution to schools, hospitals, NGOs, as well as other public and private institutions each state government may wish to consider as beneficiaries\n\nOn issues that slowed down the commencement of the GOS, the minister explained that, \u201cIn the first instance, there was the obvious need to review the other tracks of the MSME Survival Fund to enable us address the challenges in implementation, particularly the issue of failed payments and balancing value and equity among states. \u201cThere was also the need to ensure that every state government considered as key stakeholders in the GOS are fully integrated and understand their roles.\n\n\u201cAnother factor that slightly delayed the take-off of the GOS was the determination of the steering committee to ensure that all due process is followed with the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we needed to ensure that all logistics are put in place as close to each of the over 50,000 beneficiaries as possible. This obviously made a huge demand on resources but it was a factor that was considered a high priority to achieve the objectives of the GOS.\u201d\n\nShe also explained that the balance of funds from GOS would be re-purposed and applied to other tracks where there are high numbers of applicants on the waiting list.\n\n\u201cAgain, this will be applied in a very equitable manner among the states,\u201d she said, adding that the Project Delivery Office (PDO) is working with the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Bank of Industry (BoI) and Industrial Development Fund (ITF) in the implementation of the scheme.",

Change happens whether you are ready for it or not.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the Federation, you are required to continue to drive the performance of the Authority to deliver benefits to all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYou must bear in mind that the National Economic Council, your Governing Council and Nigerians as a whole will hold you accountable for this mandate.\n\n\u201cPeriodically, you will be required to provide evidence of your stewardship at the Governing Council Meetings where your performance will be assessed.\n\n\u201cThe bar before you is very high and all of us are counting on you to deliver. If you do, I assure you that Government and indeed all Nigerians will be unflinching in their support for you,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nThe President recounted that NSIA, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s premier economic institutions, was conceived to be a store of wealth which may be drawn upon at times of economic challenges thereby encouraging external investors and lenders.\n\nHe expressed delight that so far the institution has discharged its mandate dutifully.\n\n\u201cThis is why we prioritized the appointment of a new Board to ensure that the Authority does not lose steam and can continue to benefit from the oversight it needs to deliver on its mandate.\n\n\u201cThe new Board we assembled has a crop of seasoned, eminently qualified, and experienced professionals.\n\n\u201cWe expect these individuals to bring their wealth of experience to bear, in the next phase of NSIA\u2019s journey,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to thank the last Board of Directors whose tenure ended in May 2021.\n\nAcknowledging their commitment, dedication and contributions to the implementation of the objectives of the Authority, the President said: \u201cThis distinguished group of patriotic Nigerians heeded the call to serve and deployed the best of their abilities to oversee the affairs of the Authority on behalf of the nation over the last four years.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, in the past four years, both the public and private sectors in Nigeria have partnered on strategic projects with the NSIA.\n\n\u201cOn the public sector partnership, we are working with the NSIA on strategic infrastructure projects such as the Second Niger Bridge, the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Express Way and the Abuja \u2013 Kano Road, to mention a few.\n\n\u201cOn the private sector collaborations, we have projects such as the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative, the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Initiative and the NSIA Healthcare Development and Investment Company amongst many.\n\n\u201cAlthough these projects and programMEs have immediately created jobs from a development standpoint, the wider impact on society will only be felt in years to come.\u201d",

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has challenged Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, to provide evidence of his claim that there is a sinister plot by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to turn Nigeria into a Fulani and Islamic caliphate.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cNarrow Politics and Questions of Democratic Development\u201d, issued Wednesday, the party chieftain also carpeted former Deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia and a retired military officer, Commodore Kunle Olawunmi for going on air on national television to allege that people in government, including a serving Governor are the sponsors of insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\nLukman stressed that such weighty allegations which is capable of creating ethnic hatreds and religious disharmony should rather be matters of judicial investigation and once proved, all identified culprits should be made to face the full wrath of the law, and not reduced to media debates, which rather highlights how low we have descended as a nation.\n\nRecall that in August 2021, there were reports of incidences of killings in Plateau State, bandit attacks on Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), continued activities of bandits in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger States, Boko Haram \u2013 ISWAP clashes and many other criminal activities across the country which dominated national discourses.\n\nThese led to a revelation made by Commodore (Rtd) Kunle Olawunmi while granting an interview on Channels television where he alleged that government, including the presidency are the sponsors of Boko Haram and bandits.\n\nAlso in September 2020, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia similarly alleged on a live radio show that a serving Northern Governor is the sponsor of Boko Haram.\n\nLukman, who described these allegations as \u201cunsubstantiated and meaningless wild goose campaign\u201d which lack any specific proposal on how to resolve Nigeria\u2019s challenges, maintained that the claimants should have supported their claims with evidence and not just making baseless claims that are capable of setting the nation on fire.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough while making the allegations, he also claimed to have proof, after interrogation by the security, Dr. Mailafia was reported to backtracked, saying that he \u2018did not really mean to say that the government was part and parcel of the killings.\u2019 Since Commodore Olawumni has already began meeting with the security, hopefully the details of his evidence will come out.\n\n\u201cOn the part of Governor Ortom, he claimed that he has forwarded his evidence to President Buhari and security agencies in the country. But since he feels so strong as to go public with his allegation without waiting for both President Buhari and security agencies to handle the matter, he can as well make the evidence public since he has lost confidence on established processes of managing matters of national security.\u201d\n\nThe party chieftain debunked the allegations saying the only reason why such a campaign is attractive today is because President Buhari who is a Fulani man is in power.\n\n\u201cIf a primary school pupil talks like the way all the diehard opposition campaigners in the country campaigning against so-called \u2018fulanisation\u2019 and \u2018islamisation\u2019 agenda, one can excuse it because at that level of innocence, everything could appear possible. But for a public servant as highly placed as that of a Governor, retire public servant, retire security personnel, etc. it portends a big danger, which if overlooked can produce a cult mentality in the country with all the ethnic and religious hatred associated with it.\n\n\u201cBeing Governor, retired public servants, retired military personnel, with all the knowledge and experiences they have but decided to adopt the imaginary notion that a country as diverse as Nigeria can be taken over by any ethnic or religious group, is the highest manifestation of morbid symptom of attempt to block any possibility that a new society can be born out of the dying culture of corruption, greed and lawlessness, which was the hallmark of PDP\u2019s sixteen year tenure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PGF DG warned against conduct and utterances of political leaders in the country who are bent on setting the nation on fire for political gains.\n\nLukman noted that if Nigerian democracy is to develop and become the facilitator for national unity and political development in the country, there is urgent need for political parties in Nigeria to take steps to discourage ethnic and religious campaign of hatred by regulating the conduct of political leaders and elected representatives.\n\nHe added that to be able to discourage ethnic and religious campaign of hatred in the country, it would require that parties put in place internal code of conducts \u2013 byelaws, beyond what is provided in their constitution as parties, as they are today, are weak in regulating the conducts of political leaders and elected representatives.",

Mr Lungu has previously denied all wrongdoing\n\nThe BBC has approached his party for comment.\n\nMr Lungu governed the copper-rich nation since 2015. He was widely praised for the smooth transition of power to Mr Hichilema, who won the presidency after five failed attempts.\n\nFull debt \u2018not disclosed\u2019\n\nMr Hichilema won the election on a promise to tackle corruption, and to end the financial and economic crisis that has seen Zambia\u2019s debt ballooning.\n\nFor the first time since 1998, Zambia plunged into a recession last year. It also defaulted on a debt repayment.\n\nIn the BBC interview, the new president described the treasury as \u201cliterally empty\u201d.\n\nHe added that the \u201chole is much bigger than we expected\u201d and the debt situation had not been \u201cfully disclosed\u201d by the former government.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of damage, unfortunately,\u201d Mr Hichilema said.\n\nHe added that his government would show \u201czero tolerance\u201d towards corruption, and would get to the bottom of what he called the illicit movement of funds very soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pre-empt things but what we are picking [up] is horrifying,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll feel nobody can do a thing like that but it\u2019s being done. People have done it. They are still trying to do things now.\u201d\n\nMr Hichilema also said there were \u201ca lot of people who are not working, but are on the payroll\u201d of the government.\n\nMr Hichilema has appointed economist and former International Monetary Fund (IMF) adviser Situmbeko Musokotwane as finance minister.\n\n\u201cUnless we do something to the budget, then the budget will be mainly for paying salaries and also servicing debt,\u201d Mr Musokotwane was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying soon after his appointment.\n\nZambia owed foreign lenders an estimated $12bn (\u00a38.6bn), previous reports said.\n\nIt spends at least 30% of its revenue on interest payments, according to credit ratings firm S&P Global.\n\nLast year, Zambia missed an interest repayment, making it the first African country to default on a loan during the pandemic.\n\nIt is also facing difficulties repaying other loans.\n\nThe former government had borrowed heavily \u2013 including from China \u2013 to build infrastructure.\n\nMr Hichilema said the government was committed to restoring its credibility among lenders.\n\nThe government would enter into talks with China, which he was confident would \u201cunderstand that we\u2019ve inherited a very difficult situation\u201d, the president said.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that unemployment rose to more than 12% in 2020 \u2013 the highest since 2011.\n\nThe promise to create jobs for young Zambians was another key reason behind his election victory.",
