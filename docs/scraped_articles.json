          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), will on Friday proceed to London for \u201ca scheduled medical follow-up.\u201d\n\nHis Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this on Thursday in a statement titled, \u2018President Buhari off to London Friday for medical follow-up.\u2019\n\nThe statement read, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will proceed to London, the United Kingdom on Friday, June 25, 2021, for a scheduled medical follow-up.\n\n\u201cHe is due back in the country during the second week of July, 2021.\u201d\n\nBuhari leaves for London at a time of looming threats of industrial action from the National Association of Resident Doctors.\n\nRecall that the President had on Tuesday March 30, 2021 embarked on a medical trip to London for a routine medical check-up and returned two weeks later.\n\nIf the President had stayed in London for more than three weeks during his March trip, it would have been mandatory for him to hand over to the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, as demanded by the constitution.\n\nAt the time he was leaving in March, NARD declared its intention to commence a strike on April 1 and carried out its threat as resident doctors refused to work for over two weeks.\n\nOn Thursday again, NARD issued a fresh four-week ultimatum to the federal and state governments to address its demands including the payment of hazard allowances.\n\nThe association in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the virtual emergency National Executive Council lamented the failure of the government to fulfil the conditions it laid down with led to the suspension of its strike in April.\n\nNARD said it observed that salary arrears of January, February and March of its members particularly in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, University of Calabar Teaching Hospital and University College Hospital, Ibadan had been paid but was deeply worried about the re-accumulation of unpaid salaries in coming months if these members are not captured in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System\n\nThe association also lamented the extortion of money from its members by the Lagos University Teaching Hospital under the guise of minimum wage while also stating that nothing had been done by the Federal Government to the implementation of national minimum wage and non payment of salaries since the suspension of the last strike.\n\nNARD alleged that its members in Abia State University Teaching Hospital, Imo State University Teaching Hospital, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital and Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital were owed salaries ranging from 18 to one month.\n\n\u201cThe NEC unanimously resolved that the total and indefinite strike action embarked upon by our members on the April 1, 2021 should remain suspended and the Federal Government and State Governments be given four weeks to resolve the pending issues as stated otherwise risk the resumption of the strike .\n\nIt said except for Delta, Bayelsa, Enugu, Ogun and Oyo states, all the other states have yet to implement the new minimum wage for its members.\n\nMeanwhile, there was no indication on Thursday that the President would be handing over power to Osinbajo.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that when the President travelled for several months between 2016 and 2018, he transmitted power to his deputy.\n\nHowever, in the last two years, Buhari has not done so for unexplained reasons.\n\nIn 2019, Activist, Inibehe Effiong, sued the President for travelling to the UK on vacation without transmitting a letter to the National Assembly empowering Osinbajo to take over in line with Section 145 of the constitution.\n\nHowever, Justice A.O Faji ruled that Buhari was not under a duty to handover to Osinbajo unless he was absent for a period exceeding 21 days. The Presidency had also issued statements defending Buhari\u2019s decision not to transmit power to Osinbajo.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In line with the said INEC regulations and guidelines, our great party undertook the publication of timetable/schedule of activities, issued statutory notice of primary election dated the 26th of May, 2021 as envisaged under Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nHe also explained that the party adequately informed the electoral umpire of the conduct of ad hoc delegates\u2019 election across the 326 wards of Anambra State as envisaged under Section 87(7) of the Electoral Act. and submitted the list of the elected delegates to the Commission in line with Articles 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 of the INEC Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of political parties primaries; as well as other relevant procedural steps/ requirements.\n\nObiokoye further said: \u201cUndoubtedly, our great party, as a responsible entity, has never defaulted in complying with requisite procedural requirements for the nomination of its candidate in the past and will not begin now.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t stop APGA, Soludo \u2013 INEC\n\nSpeaking on the issue, in a telephone chat with Vanguard, Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, Chief press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, picked holes in reports saying that APGA or Soludo would not be on the ballot for the November 6 poll.\n\nHis words: I don\u2019t know what the brouhaha is all about. What I know is there is no faction in APGA. The officers of APGA are on our website. Their names have not been changed. The Chairman came to our stakeholders\u2019 meeting and he was welcomed.\n\n\u201dThere was no time that INEC said that APGA will not be on the ballot. There was a letter between the commission and APGA but mischievous people are misinterpreting. We have not said anything about APGA not being on the ballot for the November 6 election.

          "text": "\u2026says military is sold out to unity, peace, progress of Nigeria\n\nBy Adeola Badru\n\nThe Chief of Defense Staff, CDS, Gen. Lucky Irabor, has dismissed the perception that the military and other security agencies are conniving with bandits in carrying out their attacks with the precision with which they operate.\n\nHe disclosed this during an interaction with retired senior military officers in the south west zone of the country, held at 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Ibadan.\n\nWhile speaking with the ex servicemen, Gen. Irabor said, it was preposterous to think that the military and other security agencies are conniving with bandits to carry out their attacks, adding that it was not impossible that the criminally minded individuals may take advantage of the technological tools available to them to perpetrate their evil acts.\n\nHe maintained that it was for that reason that the military, on a daily basis, is reassessing her personal engagements to ensure that these bad elements are exposed.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt is preposterous to think that the military and other security agencies are conniving with bandits. Do you connive with someone to take your life?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat of course, is a question that should dismiss that kind of allusination anyday. All you need to know is that on a daily basis, because of the technological tools available to everyone of us, it is not impossible that the criminally minded individuals may take advantage of these tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is the reason on a daily basis, we are reassessing our personal engagements to ensure that not should our engagements be intelligence driven, we equally know that these bad elements who live amongst us need to be exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we believe this kin o interaction is necessary. So, anyone who is allucinating with the idea that the military or other security agencies are conniving with bandits, I think the person needs to have himself checked.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the interaction with retired senior military officers in the south west, Gen. Irabor said: \u201cWe are here to tap from your wealth of experience and knowledge you have acquired while in service in order to move our nation forward, through tackling the issues of insecurity challenges the country is facing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that currently there are various security issues, and we have identified our retired colleagues who of course are sold out, that is, we serving and those of them that are retired, we are all sold out to the unity, faith, peace and progress of our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat speaks to their sense of patrotism and zeal. So, we believe in their retirement that, they will be better instruments of sensitization of those who live around them on issues bothering on peace and security. This interaction is actually for us to rub minds together; they will equally speak to us as to what they observe that we need to do and what we also observe that they need to do in their various communities all in the hope of improving the state peace across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will after this southwest geo-political zone, also be going to other geo-political zones, and I think that we can only leverage on the wealth of experience they have to be able to do this, and I believe it will be better for everyone of us at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address of welcome, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Maj. Gen. Gold Chibuisi, said the interaction was meant to brainstorm with the retired senior officers in order to see how they could discuss the security challenges in Nigeria, at a time when the nation is facing series of insecurity challenges.\n\n\u201cThe platform is meant to brainstorm on ways to solve insecurity challenges battling the south west geo-political zone of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian Army are fully engaged in combating the insecurity challenges facing the country, such as banditary, Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorist attacks, farmers and herders crisis, and various attacks, these attacks called for serious concerns for all Nigerians, and that is why we are all here today to discuss way forward on ways to proffer solutions to all these crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to commend the Chief of Defence Staff, General Leo Irabo in his wisdom for organizing this platform so we can tap from the wealth of experiences of our retired senior officers, with the aim of fashioning out ways to tackle the insecurity challenges the country is currently facing.\u201d\n\nIn a remark, the Chief of Defence Civil Defence Corporation, Rear Admiral Fredrick Ugo said, the current insecurity status in the country has reached a situation where all different stakeholders have to come together and brainstorm on the how to put an end to it.\n\n\u201cAnd with gathering with the retired senior military officers in the southwest zones, and with their wealth of experience in service, they are expected to be able to provide ways to security issues in their areas, domains, and at large, in other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We are all products of elections.\n\n\u201cIf the delineation of constituencies \u2013 whether state or national \u2013 will give Nigerians better opportunities and enhance our democracy and I\u2019m sure it will, then we must work hard to do that. So, we will work with you in INEC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, Yakubu aaid the delineation of constituencies required an act of the national assembly.\n\n\u201cThe major consideration in the revision of the country\u2019s constituencies is the population quota.\n\n\u201cThe national assembly has powers under the constitution to actually request INEC to delineate constituencies by an act of the assembly.\n\n\u201cNo act of the national assembly has asked INEC to delineate constituencies since the last delineation in 1996,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Fanen Ihyongo, Kano\n\nKano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has revealed that he is using several strategies to surmount security challenges in the ancient city. The use of technology, community policing and strong synergy with all security agencies are the key among his strategies.\n\n\u201cSince crime in Nigeria has gone to the next level, security strategy too has to go to the next level,\u201d Ganduje stated on Tuesday. The governor spoke in Government House, Kano, when the Inspector- General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba visited him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to introduce technology in the management of security. In Kano, I have installed CCTV cameras all over the metropolitan city and put in place optical fibre to complement the satellite services.\n\n\u201cOur tracker vehicle is very powerful. At the entrance of the state capital, we have what we call security dormitories where about 70 policemen stay to monitor all the vehicles and people coming into the state.\n\n\u201cOur joint task force works 24 hours, manning our borders where there are security issues,\u201d he said.\n\nGanduje said his ICT security strategy includes other hi-tech gadgets he would not reveal. He added that his administration has expanded the security outfit in the state for the exchange of information, ideas and views, which he is said, is very vital for the management of security.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, we have developed the community policing with the full structure on ground synergising with the military, police, DSS, Civil Defense, Immigration, KAROTA, FRSN, among others and we have five levels of stakeholders, including the village head, ward head, the emirates and the state which is headed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG). They meet monthly to share vital information about security in their domains,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, called on other governors to study and copy the Ganduje style.\n\nThe IGP assured Nigerians that it was the constitutional responsibility of the Nigerian government and the Police Force (NPF) to protect their lives and property.\n\nHe spoke at the Kano State Police Command, Bompai and Government House, stating that new strategies, including \u2018community democratic policing\u2019 must be developed to tackle certain security challenges in the country.\n\nKano State Commissioner of Police, Sama\u2019ila Shu\u2019aibu Dikko, told the IGP that the Kano Command was having many challenges, including shortage of personnel, lack of vehicles and anti-riot equipment, especially tear smokes, which were needed for optimal performance.\n\n\u201cTaking into consideration of the population of Kano State, the available strength of 7,041 personnel is grossly inadequate for effective policing of the state,\u201d Dikko said.\n\nBut IGP insisted that the police should make use of what is available to surmount the challenges.\n\nBaba Commended Governor Ganduje for doing \u201ce-policing\u201d in Kano State. \u201cThe governor is seeing the whole town in his office. Citizens would be surprised if he calls for a security patrol team to raid a particular area.\n\n\u201cThat is how it should be, because security is not just about manpower, but also about equipment -the tools to work,\u201d he noted.",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji\n\nTwenty\u2013year-old undergraduate, Chidinma Adaora Ojukwu who allegedly murdered SuperTV boss, Michael Usifo Ataga, 49 in Lagos ,has confessed that she acted out of the influence of drugs.\n\nOjukwu a 300 level Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos, allegedly murdered Atanga at Short Service Apartment, 19, Adewale Oshin Street, Lekki, Phase 1, Lagos.\n\nIn an interview with reporters.\n\nOjukwu who was paraded by Lagos State Commissioner of Police , Mr Hakeem Odumosu at Command Headquarters ,Ikeja, said she was introduced to Ataga four months ago by her friend, adding that they used to meet at his residence in Victoria Garden City (VGC).\n\nShe claimed that on the day of the incident, June 15, she told her parents that she was going for an ushering job and would spend some days there.\n\n\u201cWe used to meet at his residence in VGC but that day, he said he was doing maintenance in the house and opted that we met at an apartment. I went online to search for the apartment and went there to do physical inspection. I got to the hotel around 6pm and he came about an hour later\n\n\u201cWe were having fun; drinking, smoking and taking drugs. On Monday, we were together, drinking and smoking. We smoked SK and Loud. We had fun and so I went to get food for both of us and then on Tuesday, he was trying to make advances which I told him I was tired. I was already sleepy then he became violent on me and he got his way which I let him.\n\n\u201cThen towards afternoon, we ordered for smoke and I wasn\u2019t happy with the first one that he did so I was still on my own just smoking and drinking with my food. He too was on his own on the couch so he came onto me while we were both watching movie and I told him I was not happy with what he did. I told him he didn\u2019t help me or assist in anything ,but he kept playing me around and then he gave me his ATM card to go and withdraw whatever I want and told me his pin.\n\n\u201cI was like that\u2019s not what I meant so he became violent trying to get to me and I was resisting and defending myself and at some point he hit my head on the wall I was struggling to go out but he was stopping me. He even locked the door and he was with the key. I didn\u2019t know where he kept it, so when I get the door he would draw me back and I also retaliated.\n\n\u201cAt some point, he was choking me while I was on the kitchen cabinet and then I stretched out to the knife and stabbed his neck twice, when I stabbed him I threw the knife on the bed then he was going for it while I went for it as well. I laid on the bed, that\u2019s when he came on me to hold the knife and I managed to stab him in the stomach.\n\n\u201cWhen he dragged the knife, he managed to slice my hand and as he was holding it, the knife broke so it slipped from his hand but he was weak and he fell on the floor. While he was lying there, I changed, I looked for the key where he hid and I left the room.\u201d\n\nOjukwu admitted she withdrew about N380,000 from Ataga\u2019s account which she planned to use as school fees before she was arrested.\n\nAddressing reporters, Odumosu said a driver\u2019s license, complimentary cards, Access Bank Statement of Account, a Nigerian International Passport with No.B50010434 were retrieved from the suspects.\n\nHe said a fake driver\u2019s license bearing Mary Johnson with the suspect\u2019s photograph, a National Identification Card bearing the suspect\u2019s name, one UBA ATM debit card bearing the suspect\u2019s name and one University of Lagos ID card bearing the suspect\u2019s name were also recovered.\n\nGiving facts of the case, Odumosu said: \u201cA case of murder was transferred from Maroko Division to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti Yaba, for discreet investigation. The fact of the case is that, on June 15, at about 5pm, one Chidimma Adaora Ojukwu, a 300 level, undergraduate of the University of Lagos, Conspired with others, now at Large, allegedly murdered one\n\nMichael Usifo Ataga, 50, by stabbing him several times with a sharp object.\n\n\u201cThe prime suspect, Chidinma, who had earlier booked for the apartment on June 13, secretly, left the apartment after the deed had been done on June 15, around 5:30pm. The suspect was tracked and arrested in her residence at 57, Akinwunmi Street, Alagomeji, Yaba-Lagos.\n\n\u201cDuring search, the prime suspect and Mass Communication Student of the University of Lagos, was caught with a blood-soaked cloth, ostensibly worn on the day of the incident. The suspect confessed to have stabbed the deceased with a kitchen knife after a struggle.\n\n\u201cShe further confessed to have taken the knife away while leaving the scene and disposed same in a dust bin at her residence. It has also been revealed that the suspect equally stole the deceased iPhone. Investigation is ongoing to arrest other accomplices. However, the case will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.\u201d",

It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the Minister that can talk about it. So, thank you,\u201dhe clarified when he spoke to State House Correspondents after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nAsked to react to ECOWAS Court ruling against Nigeria for suspending the micro-blogging platform, Twitter, Adesina said the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was studying the ruling that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted and would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina affirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage with Twitter has begun to meet.\n\nAdesina said that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\n\u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report.\n\n\u201cNigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed at the Council and the President has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\n\u201cWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d",

The event was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, all the aspirants, ministers, and leading political figures from the South east, including former Senate President, Ken Nnamani.\n\nAt that epochal event, the aspirants had pledged to go about seeking the party\u2019s ticket in an atmosphere of camaraderie \u2013 a pledge, which the APC Patriots noted they have sustained till date.",

          "text": "\u2022Call Mohammed to order, Media leaders urge Buhari\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe presidency has washed its hands off the current attempt by the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act, a move, media stakeholders and other Nigerians have condemned as an attempt to gag the press.\n\nIn a swift response, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed to order, accusing the minister of being the brain behind the antagonistic amendment bills.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, who spoke yesterday with journalists after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), said although it is an initiative of the government, only the Minister of Information and Culture, Mohammed, can address it.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat is not strictly a presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that there was nothing to report on the FEC meeting as the issues discussed were not meant for public consumption at this stage.\n\nThe spokesman, however, revealed that the president has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report. Nigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report. It\u2019s been discussed at the council and the president has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\nWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil. So, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d\n\nThe Media Adviser also disclosed that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, is studying the ruling by the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted following the suspension of the activities of the microblogging site in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina confirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage Twitter over its suspension has commenced work.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise the government on the way forward.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the president to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia Leaders Urged Buhari to Call Information Minister to Order\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE and NUJ have urged the president to call the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed to order.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the General-Secretary of NGE, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, said the media leaders found it \u201cextremely hard to agree with the Special Adviser (Media) to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, that the presidency has no hand in the proposed media amendment bills before the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that if the president has no hand in the bill, he should ask Mohammed, who is his employee to hands off the matter also.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe insist that the current attempts to criminalise journalism practice in Nigeria will have terrible, huge consequences on our democracy; because an independent press, which the federal government is trying to crush, is one of the indispensable pillars of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe media is referred to as Fourth branch of government because it also supports the balance of power in the government. Without a vibrant and independent press, the whole idea of a democracy system of government begins to deteriorate and after a short period the democracy will crumble.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the concept of a free press was purposefully and deliberately invented to preserve freedom of the people, adding that when freedom of the press is threatened, it is a threat to growing democracy.\n\nNUJ has also asked the promoters of the bill to suspend the plot especially now that the presidency has denied involvement in the obnoxious bill.\n\nNUJ President, Mr. Chris Isiguzo, spoke while reacting to the denial by the presidency that they had no hand in the plot.\n\nIsiguzo said having denied involvement, the presidency should follow it up by calling the minister of information to order since it is the same government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe expect the president to quickly call his minister and all those behind these obnoxious bills to order. They should withdraw the bills and ensure that relevant stakeholders are engaged properly before thinking of any amendment.\n\n\u201cOf course, our position is clear. You cannot embark on an amendment that will directly impact us without getting us involved. It\u2019s the same as shaving a man\u2019s head in his absence.\n\n\u201cDenial is not just enough, let the presidency call its officials involved in this anti-people journey to order.\u201d\n\nHe said the media is not afraid of any amendment or regulation but that stakeholders must be allowed to regulate the industry as is the practice in other climes.\n\n\u201cBy the time, we agree on the most appropriate template, we\u2019ll now restart the process. But for now, the entire process should be stepped down,\u201d Isiguzo said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says subsidy hits N150bn monthly\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday lamented the escalating incidence of petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders, which it puts at a whopping 42 million litres per day.\n\nThe corporation said the unbridled smuggling has increased Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 102 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the oil company stated that the subsidy that the government pays on petrol every month, in order to keep the pump price of petrol stable at N162 per litre now hovers between N140 billion and N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation to be unable to contribute to the Federation Account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, according to a statement yesterday by the corporation\u2019s General Manager, Public Affairs, Dr. Taiye Obateru, said on Tuesday in Abuja when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the EFCC, Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, that smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nSome other groups present during the stakeholders\u2019 meeting organised by the corporation to halt fuel smuggling included: the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association (DAPPMA).\n\nAt the meeting, also attended by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officials, Kyari said the country was bleeding from fuel smuggling, which is increasing the country\u2019s subsidy payment and exacerbating the foreign exchange crisis.\n\nKyari said the gathering was at the instance of President Muhammadu Buhari who mandated the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the NNPC, the EFCC and all other security agencies to do everything possible to stop crude oil theft and illicit truck-out of petroleum products, which he described as major economic crimes that have hindered Nigerians from enjoying the benefits of subsidised petroleum products.\n\nHe urged all industry stakeholders to collaborate with the NNPC to ensure that the daily national petroleum products consumption, which shot up to 102 million litres in May, is reduced to about 60 million litres.\n\nHe added that it was obvious that that huge volume of petrol was not consumed by Nigerians alone.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe all agree that smuggling is not a business that should be condoned because even for deregulated petroleum products, it brings extra cost burden on this country both in terms of safety and security of supply and in securing of foreign exchange. It even constitutes more burden to this country when the product involved is a regulated product like Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the increasing price of crude oil at the global market and the OPEC+ production cuts, the country cannot afford to shoulder the cost of smuggling.\n\n\u201cWe all know that our daily consumption is not up to 60 million litres. We all know that, and that is why we have to pull it down. We will pull it down by every means necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said NNPC would introduce advanced cargo declaration in line with global best practices to tackle crude oil theft.\n\nKyari stated that going after smugglers is beyond the call of the corporation, adding that with the involvement of the EFCC, the situation will improve considerably.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots, but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the extant directive from the president that smuggling has to be halted, all the stakeholders must now begin to work together to solve the problem, especially with the involvement of the security agencies.\n\nKyari said Buhari had instructed that the menace must be stopped by every means necessary, and called on the stakeholders present to think outside the box since all the layers of controls that had been put in place before now seemed to have failed.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate and considering other price determinants, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre.\n\n\u201cWhat we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nKyari stated that with the current high volume of daily consumption, the country can no longer sustain subsidy payment, and if the volume is not regulated, the bleeding will continue.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know that so much work is going on, and then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256. The difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201cAnd as long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, the stress of supply and the stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC.\u201d\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, also decried the increasing rate of smuggling but expressed optimism that with the EFCC\u2019s involvement, the situation would change.\n\n\u201cWe brought in the big hammer, and the big hammer as you can see is the EFCC because it is economic sabotage and I believe with the EFCC in the picture, the system will work even better,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that whatever is being done in the area of deregulation will not make any impact without Nigeria knowing exactly its actual daily consumption of petrol.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in as minister, I was informed that the daily consumption in the country was around 60 million to 62 million litres a day, which to me sounded a little bit outrageous, considering the number of cars we have on the road,\u201d he said.\n\nChairman of the EFCC, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, said since part of the commission\u2019s duty was to ensure the reduction of financial crimes, the EFCC would do all it could to stop smuggling.\n\nBawa assured Nigerians that everything will be done to stop smuggling, ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and justice is served.\n\nHe said smuggling of petroleum products was worrisome, and assured Nigerians that the EFCC was fully committed to the special operation, codenamed \u201cOperation White\u201d designed to check illegal exportation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gunmen suspected to be bandits have invaded the military barracks of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State, and carted away a herd of cattle in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nThe incident happened around 2:00 am as the gunmen arrived at the barracks and started shooting sporadically in the air to cause panic in the Army community.\n\nThough the exact number of the cattle stolen could not be determined, an eyewitness told SaharaReporters on Thursday evening that the cows would not be less than a hundred in number based on previous experience.\n\nAccording to the source who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, the cattle were owned by Army officers.\n\nHe, therefore, expressed shock that the barracks could be so porous for bandits to attack without any form of resistance.\n\nThe source told SaharaReporters the first time it happened was last year and that about 400 cows were taken away by the bandits in what he described as a bloodless attack on the barracks.\n\nHe, however, said some of the animals found their way back to their ranch.\n\nThe Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji in Kaduna State is a training facility for the Nigerian Armed Forces, including the army, air force, and navy.\n\n\u201cAround 2:00 am on Thursday, gunmen invaded where cattle are kept at Jaji barracks in Kaduna here. Those cattle are owned by some military officers. So, they are kept at the Mammy market, inside the barracks at Jaji here. I cannot tell you the number of cows taken by these bandits but before the operation, they were shooting sporadically in the air.\n\n\u201cEven the people outside the barracks heard the gunshots. And this was not the first time. The first time it happened was last year. That one happened close to the Firing Range. They went there and took away all the cattle. About 400 cows were taken away. Some of them (cows) managed to come back to their ranch,\u201d the source said.\n\nWhen asked if the bandits came with a truck or any vehicle to convey the cattle, the eyewitness said they did not drive any truck.\n\nHe said they took the cattle away on foot.\n\nThe source expressed concern that the barracks always accommodate Army officers from other African and Asian countries who take some courses at the college, adding that it would be an embarrassment should a foreigner be abducted on Nigerian soil.\n\nHe also lamented that both the military personnel and civilians living in the barracks and the areas surrounding the military base are no longer safe.\n\nHe said there have been several attacks launched by bandits on the communities.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t come with any vehicle. They would just come on foot and push the cattle away. This is telling us that one day, even, the Army officers in the barracks can be kidnapped. And the barracks are one of the most strategic barracks in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the barracks there, there are houses that even foreign Army officers that are taking courses live in. The Jaji barracks are among the largest in the country and if this kind of thing is happening there, that means we are not safe anymore.\n\n\u201cThere was a time even military officers from African and Asian countries came for courses there. Majors and Captains do come there from different countries. Every graduation, you will notice that about 17 African countries participate. It means that even foreign officers can be abducted. And if this happens, it is a slap on the face of the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the military authorities are doing anything to see how they can tackle the issue. What I want you to know is that even the immediate areas surrounding the barracks are being attacked daily, and nothing is done. Outside the cantonment, barely a kilometre away is not safe,\u201d he said.",

First, we don\u2019t have the necessary revenues. Nigeria is poor; we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNigeria is not rich, given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have.

          "text": "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says 34,457 people were killed by insurgents in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states between 2009 and early 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2020 report titled: \u2018Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in North-east Nigeria\u2019, the agency said insurgency has crippled development across various sectors in the region.\n\nUNDP, however, noted that outside the almost 35,000 fatalities recorded as a direct result of insurgency, there have been hundreds of thousands of people who have died over causes indirectly related to conflict in the north-east.\n\n\u201cInsurgent violence and terrorism carried out by Boko Haram and Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) remain the major driver of insecurity across north-eastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region,\u201d the report reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe effects of the insurgency and the persistence of insecurity are inseparable from the region\u2019s pre-existing socio-economic deprivation and harsh environmental conditions.\n\n\u201cThe BAY states \u2014 Borno, Adamawa and Yobe \u2014were not only some of the poorest states in the country prior to conflict, but they also continue to bear the brunt of its effects.\n\n\u201cAs of 31 July 2020, conflict has directly resulted in 34,457 deaths in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states since the beginning of 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConflict can also increase mortality indirectly. For example, destroyed health infrastructure and degraded living conditions can lead to increased deaths from disease and hunger. To our knowledge, there have been no prior efforts to estimate the number of indirect deaths from this conflict.\u201d\n\nDISPLACEMENT\n\nThe agency lamented that insurgency in the three states led to the displacement of over 1.8 million people before the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram attacks have led to massive internal displacement. More than 1.8 million Nigerians are displaced in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states, with the vast majority (nearly 1.5 million) located in Borno,\u201d UNDP noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn camps and host communities, IDPs often live in poor conditions and lack access to adequate food and services.\u201d\n\nPOVERTY\n\nUNDP also said the insurgency in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe led to an intense level of poverty in Nigeria, adding that \u201cas of 2019, 81 percent of people living in Yobe, 64 percent in Borno, and 60 percent in Adamawa suffer from multidimensional poverty, a measure that accounts for deprivation with respect to standards of living, health, and education\u201d.\n\nHEALTH AND MORBIDITY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency maintained that insurgency has ravaged the region, leading to severe and acute malnutrition of thousands of children.\n\n\u201cOver 920,000 children in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe are estimated to have global acute malnutrition (GAM), while over 288,000 have severe acute malnutrition (SAM),\u201d UNDP said.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has also rendered 85 percent of Borno territory inaccessible to humanitarian agencies, constraining the ability to provide aid.\u201d\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the report, the frequent attacks on schools have also left a damaging impact on the educational system in the region.\n\n\u201cConflict has been especially damaging to education, as schools have been targeted directly by insurgents,\u201d UNDP said.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we estimate that 1.8 million students are out of school who would have been enrolled if not for conflict.\n\n\u201cBy 2030, in the Conflict scenario, the average Nigerian in the BAY states will have had a full year (20 percent) of education less than expected in the No Conflict scenario. This setback in human development will require decades to recover from.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that while the federal government has made \u201cgreat strides in retaking and stabilising large portions of the region\u201d, it has only recorded \u201climited success\u201d in putting and end to the insurgency.\n\nThe UNDP report added that it would be difficult to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the region even if the insurgency ends \u2014 considering the level of damage already done in various areas.",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "Chaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year.\nAs part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria.\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC.\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence.",

          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "In 2020, Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford tweeted that reading and books are cool. But, unfortunately, this is not the case for everyone.\n\nReading is cool. Books are cool.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the tweet \ud83d\udcda \u2014 Marcus Rashford MBE (@MarcusRashford) November 18, 2020\n\nMary*, a dyslexic Nigerian, shared her struggles with reading under Rashford\u2019s tweet. And in a few minutes, his fans in the UK criticised her, explaining how technology has made learning easier for people with dyslexia and other learning disabilities like dyscalculia and dysgraphia.\n\nA 2017 World Bank research in 19 middle and low-income countries reveals that 3 in 10 children with disabilities have never enrolled in school, and more than half who enrol don\u2019t complete primary school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLikewise, while one in six children with disabilities is literate, only two complete their secondary school education.\n\nLiving with learning disabilities in Africa\n\nPhoto by Santi Vedr\u00ed on Unsplash\n\nLearning disabilities are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information.\n\nThe American National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) established that learning disabilities affect children\u2019s abilities to understand or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention.\n\nAfrica on the Blog, a blog that addresses social issues in Africa, describes how some Ugandan schools rejected a dyslexic boy because of his learning disability (LD).\n\nAnother study shows that slow learners and children with learning disabilities (LDs) in Africa are on the rise; but determining the number in some countries is nearly impossible because of inadequate data.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that assistive products are only available to one in ten people who need them.\n\nIn 2017, the International School of Disability Studies (ISDS) concluded that most people with LDs are not diagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nPerhaps, Mary typifies the average African who is unaware of what learning disabilities are or doesn\u2019t know enough of assistive technology to get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFejiro, a young adult who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \u2014 a common disorder that co-exists with learning disabilities \u2014 in 2016, says, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of assistive technology. Whenever I read, I use ebooks and web searches, but I\u2019m easily distracted. Studying is hard, I won\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nConsequently, some people with LDs are tagged stupid or other derogatory names.\n\nOladoyin Idowu is the founder of One Word Africa \u2014 a dyslexia-focused initiative in Africa. A person with dyslexia herself, she said that teachers called her stupid, which affected her self-esteem.\n\nShe left school and didn\u2019t return until she found her confidence in interior design.\n\nDare*, a young Nigerian in his mid-20s \u2014 who has run personal diagnosis tests online \u2014 says, \u201cLast year, I found out that I might have been dealing with dyslexia and ADHD. Perhaps, that is why I struggled through school and eventually became a dropout. Concerning assistive technology, I haven\u2019t heard of it.\u201d\n\nAlthough children with learning disabilities find it hard to cope in school and are more likely to be withdrawn, assistive technology (AT) can make learning easier with devices and services that develop or improve children\u2019s capabilities.\n\nWhat is assistive technology (AT)?\n\nAccording to the Assistive Technology Industry Association, AT is any item, piece of equipment, software program, or product system that increases, maintains, or improves the functionality and capabilities of persons with disabilities.\n\nAT improves learning disability difficulties affecting listening, writing, reading, math, organisation, and memory. And it ranges from low-tech like special writing instruments to high-tech like iPads designed to meet a child\u2019s specific learning needs.\n\nHardware like the voice amplification system and speech-generating device, software like the text-to-speech systems, and inclusive to specialised learning materials and curriculum like modern devices with specialised apps support learning.\n\nTypes of accessible assistive technology\n\nText-to-speech AT\n\nThis software helps children and adults with learning disabilities like dyslexia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) comprehend texts when read out to them.\n\nThis easily accessible type of AT can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. However, it\u2019s only useful for people who retain information by listening rather than reading.\n\nLikewise, it offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for people with dyslexia and dysgraphia.\n\nIn a 2009 research, Hsin-Yu Chiang and Karen Jacobs mention that this type of AT improves children\u2019s work perception and makes their writings expressive. Some of the examples of this are NaturalReader, Ivona, and iSpeech.\n\nSpeech-to-text AT\n\nWriting includes low transcription skills like handwriting, spelling, punctuation, grammar; it also contains high composition skills like planning, generating content, and revising.\n\nThus, this type of software transcribes words that help people with dyspraxia and dysgraphia.\n\nIt is believed that the software increases students\u2019 productivity since they help them to avoid typing or handwriting.\n\nThis type of AT improves word recognition, spelling, and reading comprehension skills among children with learning disabilities.\n\nOther assistive technology tools\n\nPhoto by Jukka Aalho on Unsplash\n\nTools like audiobooks and publications, abbreviation expanders, electronic math worksheets, proofreading programmes, information/data managers, optical character recognition, variable speed-tape recorders, word prediction programmes, talking calculators, speech recognition programmes, speech synthesisers/screen recorders, and alternative keyboards support people with learning disabilities.\n\nIn a 2018 fact sheet, WHO describes how technology is helping people with learning disabilities to live healthily, independently, productively. It also highlights their full involvement in education, the labour market, and civic life, which means learning disabled people can recognise, unleash, and reach their full potentials.\n\nWhy assistive technology?\n\nLearning disabilities do not affect intelligence but impair one or more cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nConsequently, adopting assistive technology helps improve an individual\u2019s learning skills like math, reading, writing, organisation, abstract reasoning, long and short-term memory, attention, and time planning.\n\nSpeaking on why she adopted AT, Idowu says, \u201cI use assistive technology, and it really makes my life easy. The Speechify app and OneNote Immersive Reader help me to scan my notes and convert them to audio. I can also upload my notes on them. I use Grammarly, QuillBot, and The Mind app.\u201d\n\nBesides, having a sound support system as a learning disabled person is helpful.\n\n\u201cI cannot overemphasise the power of a good support system \u2014 having people that genuinely care and want to help. I have a friend who helps restructure, proofread, and edit all my writings,\u201d she points out.\n\nShe adds, \u201cthere was a time I developed physical panic episodes before an exam I was to write. I was so scared, and it was about to be a public nightmare, but my friends took the initiative and helped to manage the situation.\u201d\n\nThere is currently no cure for learning disabilities. However, AT has been proven to improve learning for children with learning disabilities, as reflected in this research where students with learning disabilities used Dragon \u2014 a speech-to-text tool \u2014 for dictations.\n\nThe result revealed a significant impact, proving that assistive technology eliminates barriers based on learning disabilities.\n\nThe causes of learning disabilities are unknown. However, they have been linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain; in some cases, they are hereditary. What they aren\u2019t are the results of witchcraft activities.\n\nWith no cure in sight, children with LDs can unleash their potential and succeed with a good support system while adopting assistive technology.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

          "text": "The emergence of Charles Chukwuma Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State, has been received with excitement in some quarters.\n\nSoludo has remained a respected economic policy authority in Nigeria since leaving the CBN, credited as the only CBN governor in recent times to ensure a single-digit inflation rate for 24 consecutive months.\n\nFor some observers, Soludo\u2019s emergence and eventual success at the poll may perhaps be the beginning of a new chapter for Anambra State based on his track record and excellent performance while in public office.\n\nA third quarter 2020 data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that Anambra State had the lowest unemployment rate in Nigeria.\n\nThe data show that only 13 percent of the 2.3 million working people in the state are unemployed in a nation where the national average unemployment rate is over 27 percent.\n\nOf course, this is a great feat by the Willie Obiano administration, which has shown great leadership promise in transforming the infrastructure of the state, attracting industries and creating a socially stable, business-friendly environment.\n\nHowever, there is the feeling among the populace that the state is not where it should be, considering its potential and promise.\n\nPundits say that based on his track record as governor of the CBN where he embarked on major transformation of the banking sector through a banking consolidation that provided trillions of naira credit to thousands of businesses and created unprecedented employment, Soludo has what it takes to transform Anambra State.\n\nThey believe he can take the state to an enviable position by creating a conducive business environment for great indigenous entrepreneurs to invest in the state, and extending the same to the whole of South Eastern region.\n\nHowever, others say the position of a state governor is a sharp contrast from being the head of the CBN, while so many factors could also count and decide his success or failure in office as state governor.\n\n\u201cSoludo should understand that the state governorship position is not like being a CBN governor, and Anambra is not like Lagos State or Rivers State that is commercial based, where there is money to execute projects.\n\n\u201cSo, if he wants to perform he may adopt stricter policy in taxation to get money from people, which may be misunderstood. I think he would perform, if the people can be patient with him, but his policies may be misunderstood initially,\u201d political commentator, Tade Ademola, says.\n\nSince 2009, when he narrowly lost the Anambra State gubernatorial election as a candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) to Peter Obi, Soludo has never hidden his intention to govern the state.\n\nAnd since moving to APGA, he has thrown his hat in the ring on several occasions without success, while consistently being a supporter of Obiano\u2019s administration. So, his decision to contest the November 6, 2021, election did not come as a surprise to many.\n\nSpeaking recently, while declaring his ambition, Soludo had said he hoped to leverage his international connections to transform the state. He said having served the global community, he was now poised to serve and develop Anambra.\n\nSoludo won the Wednesday\u2019s primaries by polling a total of 740 votes out of a total of 792 votes cast in the election.\n\nHe won three other contestants that included the member representing Orumba-North/Orumba-South Federal Constituency, Okwudili Chukwu Ezenwankwo, who scored 41 votes; Damian Okolo, 7 votes, and ThankGod Ibe, who polled 4 votes.\n\nSpeaking on the exercise, Anambra State governor, Willie Obiano, described the conduct of the primaries as most peaceful, free, fair and transparent.\n\nHe charged APGA members to brace up for the challenges of making sure that the party wins the main election, and expressed optimism that the party would repeat its victory that returned him for a second term.\n\nIn 1998, Soludo was appointed to the position of professor of economics at the University of Nigeria; the next year he became a visiting professor at Swarthmore in Swarthmore, USA.\n\nSoludo joined the Federal Government in 2003, and became the CBN governor from May 2004 to 2009.\n\nPrior to his May 2004 appointment, he held the positions of chief economic adviser to former President Obasanjo and chief executive of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria.\n\nHe is also a member of the British Department\u2019s International Advisory Group, and currently serves on the Chief Economist Advisory Council (CEAC) of the World Bank.\n\nHe is also a consultant and strategic adviser to institutional investors in Africa; a member of the Technical Advisory Group of the Natural Resource Charter, Oxford, and member and chairman of boards of several companies.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as a member of an eight-man Economic Advisory Council, which reports directly to him.",

          "text": "Most digital banking solutions focus more on payment services while the availability of credit receives little attention when it comes to digitised banking. Ergo, players in the Fintech space are making a call toward the digitisation of credit to boost the economy.\n\nThe gains of digitising the credit processes both for organisations and businesses in need of loans were discussed at a stakeholder meeting organised by the Committee of E-Business Industry Heads (CeBIH) in Lagos.\n\nIn line with the central topic, stakeholders were urged to transform credit through digital optimisation as it would foster equal access to credit facility to everyone, especially those at the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nDigital lending is seen as the process of offering loans that are applied for, disbursed, and managed through digital channels. The process is instant, automated, and remote.\n\nThe chairman of CeBIH Adeyemi Atanda said he believes that availing credit is one of the major avenues to drive economic empowerment.\n\nRead Also: 5 funding opportunities for SMEs in Nigeria\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent, he said Nigeria is at the level of two to three percent credit availability to the bottom of the pyramid, whereas in other developed countries, that ratio is about 40 percent.\n\nFurther checks show that Nigeria\u2019s overall financial inclusion target was 80 percent by 2020. EFInA data shows that only 64 percent of Nigerian adults were financially included by the end of 2020, meaning that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38 million adults, remain completely financially excluded.\n\nOn the issue of financial inclusion, women remain more financially excluded than men, with only 45 percent of women using formal financial services, compared with 56 percent of men.\n\n\u201cThis means that Nigeria is very far from the target,\u201d Atanda said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t make credit available to people, SMEs will not grow, businesses will not be able to expand and we\u2019ll not be able to create employment which actually is supposed to drive our economy.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said there is a need for home-grown solutions to be able to drive digital credit optimization as every solution imported is paid in FX and there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the Naira right now.\n\n\u201cSo, to reduce that, we need to grow our own solutions locally,\u201d he adds.\n\nAlthough cultural behaviour, regulation and enabling environment, IT infrastructure, and organisational structure were some identified challenges at the event, Anino Akperi, CEO, Money Mall, said digital innovations should be designed in such a way that Nigerians can have access to loans.\n\nHe argued that a lot has changed in the credit space as the sector has moved beyond manual processing of things: manual customer acquisition, manual credit processing, disbursement, and other processes.\n\nCommending CeBIH for being able to bring to show that every aspect of banking can be digitalised, and not just payment systems and money transfers, he noted that the credit area is a critical aspect of banking and if digitised, it will help the banks to reduce their cost of customer acquisition, cost of credit administration, and also help those that are seeking facilities to be able to get money easily.\n\nMost importantly, the issue of credit concentration is eliminated with digitized credit, according to Akperi, who said more than 40 percent of loans granted in Nigeria are within three sectors: oil and gas, construction, and maybe government.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the rest,\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cAnd that also points out something: whenever we have issues around oil price, non-performing loans in the industry go up. So, critically, every lender will need to diversify, spread out these loans.\n\n\u201cLet the loans no longer be concentrated in Lagos. Let the man in Damaturu, and Eket have equal access such that the opportunities that exist there, the people can take advantage of it and do well and it helped the entire economy.\u201d\n\nSteve Bireley, chief technology officer, Lokyata, advised Fintechs to find ways to measure the effectiveness of digital optimisation because with measurement, they will not know how effective their optimisation is.\n\nCeBIH is constituted of the upper echelon of electronic business industry practitioners in all Banks in Nigeria with its major and most important objective being the promotion of electronic banking services in line with global best practices.\n\nThis event is one of its activities at driving awareness across the industry.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",
          "summary": "Tunde Opalana, AbujaThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\nThis has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals.",

She is a true demonstration of can-do spirit, which reflects her decision to serve the country as a police officer after attaining a coveted position on an international sporting platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to use her as a testimony to give women strong voice and good representation in our sport organisations.\n\n\u201cWe have made it compulsory to reserve 30 per cent of positions to our women in boards of sport organisations in Lagos,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Ajunwa-Oparah decorated the governor with a replica of her 1996 gold medal.\n\nShe described the gesture as a \u201dmotivation\u201d to fulfil her dream in raising a new generation of athletes, adding that the governor\u2019s action had further reinforced her belief in the country.\n\nPresenting cheques to the successful Lagos athletes, Sanwo-Olu urged them not to rest on their oars in excelling and achieving greater feats in the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe governor said that there would be a new beginning for sports in Lagos, as the amended Sport Commission Law, which he signed earlier in the day, was initiated to promote sporting activities at the grassroots.\n\nSanwo-Olu disclosed that he had given an approval for the upgrade of Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere to make it a standard sport centre.\n\nHe added that the state government was set to commence the concurrent construction of eight new mini-stadia across the state, to further improve youth participation in sports.\n\n\u201dWe have just signed an amendment on Sport Commission Bill into Law after the House of Assembly adjusted the law for us.\n\n\u201dWith the new law, we will have more robust grassroots sport competitions and it will take sport to a granular level where we will have a lot more participation and infrastructure development at the grassroots level.\n\n\u201dOur youths have brighter days ahead and I enjoin them not to give up on their skills. There is a reward for hard work, but sometimes the reward may be delayed. You should not be discouraged because people are watching. At the right time, God will come through for you,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nThe Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Segun Dawodu, thanked Sanwo-Olu for prioritising youth development activities, describing the governor\u2019s gesture as unprecedented.\n\nSanwo-Olu rewarded the Lagos representatives at the National Sport Festival with N146 million, he also presented cheques ranging from N300,000 to N5 million to winners of medals in the contest.\n\nAhmed Koleosho, a para table tennis player and Lagos team captain, received a cheque of N2.5 million from the governor as prize for his feat. He will also be representing Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympic Games.",

          "text": "Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has stated that it is deploying 5, 346 staff for the Continous Voter Registration, CVR exercise, schedule to commence on the 28th of June, 2021, in 2,673 registration centres nationwide.\n\nChairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, made the disclosure today, during a press conference and the launching of the online registration portal for the resumption of the CVR at the INEC headquarters Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the Register of Voters is at the heart of democratic elections and that a good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. Stating that, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\n\nIn his words; \u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device, IVED. This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM).\n\n\u201cIn our determination serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards, PVCs online.\n\n\u201cWe hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience. The portal will go live in the early hours of Monday 28th June 2021. However, I must quickly reiterate that the online registration is a public service and therefore free of charge. There is no INEC-approved cybercafe, no online registration centre and no scratch card to be purchased for the exercise. All you need is a device, including your mobile phones that can connect to the internet. Citizens can complete the online pre-registration anywhere and at anytime they choose. Just follow the simple but detailed step-by-step procedure on the portal and contact the INEC Help Desk where necessary. The details are on our website,\u201d he added.\n\nThe exercise according to Prof. Yakubu, is meant for the following categories of Nigerians; Those who are 18 years and above and have not registered previously; Registered voters who have had any problem during accreditation for any past election, with either their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards or their fingerprints not being read by the Smart Card Reader; Registered voters who want to transfer their voting location from one place to another. Registered voters who want to correct issues with their data, such as misspelt names, dates of birth, etc. And registered voters whose PVCs are lost or damaged.",

Godswill Akpabio, has reiterated that President Muhammadu Buhari is determined to change the story of the Niger Delta region, from having to bear decades of decay in infrastructures, to that of access to services and infrastructural development.\n\nAkpabio gave this assurance when he met with the Charge \u2018d\u2019 Affaires of the Embassy of Ireland to Nigeria, Mr. Conor Finn and his team who paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nThe minister noted that the people of the Niger Delta region have had to bear with strive violence and deprivation since 1956 when oil was first discovered in Oloibiri Bayelsa State.\n\nThe former Akwa Ibom Governor added that pollution in most areas is so serious that it destroys aquatic life, which should be a source of livelihood for the people, noting that what led to militancy was the attitude and method of operations adopted by the International Oil Companies, IOCs.\n\n\u201cThe present administration even when working under very difficult circumstances is doing everything to alleviate the peoples suffering and the first thing that must change is the attitude, not just of the IOC\u2019S, but also of the people because they are part of the problem. So there must be a change of attitude from that of receiving tokenism to that of insisting on access to development and services,\u201d Akpabio said.\n\nEarlier, Permanent Secretary of the Niger Delta ministry, Dr. Babayo Ardo said \u201cwe are working together to actualize all the deliverables particularly in the areas of women empowerment initiatives, skill acquisition by youths to provide basic skills and means of livelihood for that segment of the population. The completion of 346km East-West Road is our priority and other projects that have been completed are slated for commissioning soon\u201d.\n\nIn his response, the Irish Envoy to Nigeria commended the minister and his team for the ongoing efforts at repositioning the Niger Delta and curbing extremism within the region.\n\nHe assured that the Irish government will continue to partner with the ministry to provide sustainable development for the region and the country as a whole, stressing the need to improve services and infrastructure.\n\nReaffirming the Irish partnership, Reverend Father Kevin O\u2019 Hara said he has great hope in the minister, having seen what he did in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nHe further sought for areas that the Irish government can key in to help the region to make a difference.",

When the youth started the #EndSARS protest, Mr President supported the genuine agitation and approved the demand of the youths by disbanding SARS immediately until anarchists took over the situation and began to cause destruction.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on all youths to support President Buhari who has shown uncommon love for the youth. The President swiftly disbanded SARS when the youths took to the streets to protest. Truly President Buhari ended SARS before anarchy took over the movement. We are at a critical moment in our national life and as youth we must not be part of those who seek to cripple the country. The youths should rather rise to the occasion and join hands with the government to redirect the Nigerian State on the path of productivity in line with the steadfast vision of Mr. President. The President has firm confidence in the youth and believes lasting legacies can be built in partnership with the youth, we must not betray the President by pitching tent with anarchists and scessionists who want to destroy the country\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nThe statement further noted that as the umbrella body of youth organisations, it would gather youths from all works of life on 1st of July to discuss the imperative of a peaceful Nigeria.\n\nNYCN while commending the media for its role in uniting the nation, dismissed calls calling for scrapping of the NYSC scheme.",

          "text": "The police have arrested a university student accused of killing Usifo Ataga, the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV.\n\nAtaga was said to have been found in a pool of his blood with multiple wounds on his body after the media mogul was stabbed to death at a hotel where he reportedly lodges in the Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nChidinma Ojukwu, a 300-level Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), was paraded on Thursday at the Lagos State Police Command headquarters in Ikeja.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, told reporters at the briefing that the suspect had confessed that she stabbed Ataga.\n\nHe disclosed that the owner of the rented apartment where the tragic incident occurred has been arrested and held in police detention.\n\nOdumosu added that Ataga\u2019s bank account has been blocked in a bid to prevent further withdrawals by those taking advantage of his untimely death.\n\nDuring a session with reporters, 21-year-old Chidinma gave an account of what transpired between her and the late businessman whom she accused of raping her.\n\nShe claimed that Ataga made a first attempt which was successful, noting that the unfortunate incident took place after she resisted a second attempt.\n\n\u201cWe were in the lodge smoking. He was trying to make advances on me. I was tired and he became violent on it. I let him have his way.\n\n\u201cTowards afternoon, he ordered roofies. We took it together and ate food. He became high. I was still not happy with the first one (sex) that we had, so, I was staying on my own, smoking and drinking. He, too, was on his own. He came to me, and I told him I wasn\u2019t happy with what he did,\u201d the suspect recounted.\n\nShe added, \u201cHe was like, \u2018Take my ATM and withdraw what you want\u2019. He later became violent trying to get to me and I was resisting and defending myself. At some point, he hit my head on the wall and I also retaliated.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chidinma, Ataga began to chase her at some point in the kitchen where she took a knife and stabbed him in the neck.\n\nShe explained that the media mogul followed her as she approached the door before she stabbed him twice on the neck side again.\n\n\u201cI threw the knife to the bed, and he was going for it, but I also went for it. He dragged the knife with me and it broke, and he fell on the floor,\u201d she narrated.",

          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has explained why it is important for the Nigerian government to continue to borrow responsibly to fund critical projects in the country.\n\nHe believes it is not feasible for the government to tax the people further in the face of the present economic situation and the nation\u2019s infrastructure must be developed.\n\nThe Senate President made the remarks on Thursday while briefing State House correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cYou cannot, in my view and judgement, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructural development; other countries do that, but we have serious situation across the country.\n\nSo, you cannot put taxes on the people. The only option left is for use to borrow responsibly, utilise prudently and economically, and ensure that the projects are self-sustaining; that they can pay back the loans,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Lawan added, \u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we do not have the necessary revenue; Nigeria is poor, we should not deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have.\n\n\u201cOur resources are so low, our revenues are so low; therefore, the option of not doing anything just to sit (because we have no money, we should not go for infrastructure development) is not an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\u201d\n\nInvestors Not Willing\n\nHe gave the assurance that the National Assembly would give legislative approval to the Executive loan request to fund the 2021 Appropriation Act before it embarked on a recess in July.\n\nThe lawmaker reiterated that the 2021 Supplementary Bill would also go through final consideration before the recess to fast-track the government\u2019s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and military hardware to tackle insecurity.\n\nWhile stressing the need to borrow funds, he stated that the Legislature would not just support or approve loans for the executive.\n\nThe Senate President noted that this would be done only after investigating the implementation of such loans through oversight functions to ensure that they were directly deployed for intended projects.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has no other choice than to borrow money and the option of private-public partnerships and Internally Generation Revenue (IGR) was not worthy of consideration.\n\nSenator Lawan said, \u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the Executive arm of government; whenever we have to approve any loan, we will insist on the details of the funding to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans and they must be favourable conditions before we approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other option is probably private partnership \u2013 you need to create the environment to attract investors to come into your country. Because of the security challenges we face today, not many investors would like to come to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even those inside Nigeria may not like to invest properly in the sector of infrastructure development,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "UEFA Abolishes 56-year Old Away Goals Rule in Major Shake-up of Club Competitions",
          "text": "UEFA on Thursday abolished away goals rule in European tournament knockout ties and will take effect from the 2021-22 season.\n\nThe rule had been in place since 1965, was used to determine a winner when teams were level on aggregate after a two-legged match. The team that had scored more goals as the away side were awarded the victory. But from now, this will be replaced by extra-time and penalties.\n\nA UEFA statement read: \u201cFollowing the recommendation of the UEFA Club Competitions Committee and the UEFA Women\u2019s Football Committee, the UEFA Executive Committee has today approved a proposal to remove the so-called away goals rule from all UEFA club competitions (men, women and youth) as of the qualifying phases of the 2021/22 competitions.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the abolishment of the away goals rule, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said: \u201cThe away goals rule has been an intrinsic part of UEFA competitions since it was introduced in 1965. However, the question of its abolition has been debated at various UEFA meetings over the last few years. Although there was no unanimity of views, many coaches, fans and other football stakeholders have questioned its fairness and have expressed a preference for the rule to be abolished.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the rule now runs counter to its original purpose as, in fact, it now dissuades home teams \u2014 especially in first legs \u2014 from attacking, because they fear conceding a goal that would give their opponents a crucial advantage. There is also criticism of the unfairness, especially in extra time, of obliging the home team to score twice when the away team has scored.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to say that home advantage is nowadays no longer as significant as it once was. Taking into consideration the consistency across Europe in terms of styles of play, and many different factors which have led to a decline in home advantage, the UEFA Executive Committee has taken the correct decision in adopting the view that it is no longer appropriate for an away goal to carry more weight than one scored at home.\u201d",
