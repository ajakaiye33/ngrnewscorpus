          "text": "The detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has gone to court to challenge the practice direction of the Federal High Court which ordered that trial of terrorism cases like his matter be done in secret.\n\nHe asked the court to declare that the provisions of Order III of the Federal High Court Practice Directions (On Trial of Terrorism Cases) 2022, were already the subject of Section 36 (4)(a) and (b) of the 1999 Constitution, making them inoperative and ultra vires.\n\nKanu, in the originating summons filed by his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, asked the court to declare the provisions invalid, null, void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\nThe Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, and its Chief Registrar were listed as defendants in the suit which processes were obtained by journalists on Monday.\n\nJustice Tsoho had released a new practice direction for the trial of terrorism cases before the court.\n\nThe cases of Kanu and Bureau de Change operators that were indicted over the sponsorship of terrorism and Boko Haram suspects are currently before the court.\n\nJustice Tsoho said the new practice direction was in the exercise of his constitutional powers as enshrined in Section 254 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, the court said media coverage of proceedings is strictly prohibited.\n\nThe IPOB leader also wants an order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from applying and enforcing the provisions of the Federal High Court Practice Directions (On Trial of Terrorism Cases) 2022.\n\nOthers reliefs he sought were \u201cA declaration that the failure of the first defendant to first seek and obtain the approval of the Federal Executive Council (or the National Council of Ministers) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria prior to enacting the Federal High Court Practice Directions (on Trials of Terrorism Cases), 2022, as required by Section 44 of the Federal High Court Act renders the Federal High Court Practice Direction (On Trial of Terrorism Cases) 2022, ultra vires, null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that Order III Rules 3(b) and (d) of the Federal High Court Practice Directions (On Trials of Terrorism Cases) 2022, which respectively empower a Federal High Court trying terrorism cases to receive evidence by video link, and to receive written deposition of expert witness, are inconsistent with Items 23 and 68 of the Exclusive Legislative List as well as Paragraph 2(b) of Part III of the 2nd Schedule to the Constitution which confers on the National Assembly the exclusive power to make rules of evidence, both substantive and adjectival and are therefore, ultra vires, null and void to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n\u201cA declaration that Order IV Rule 2 of the Federal High Court Practice Direction (on Trial of Terrorism Cases) 2022, which provides that a person who contravenes an order or direction made under these directions shall be deemed to have committed an offence contrary to Section 34(5) of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 (as amended), is otiose and inoperative because the National Assembly had already covered the field vide Section 34(5) of the Terrorism Prevention Act 2011, as amended.\n\n\u201cA declaration that the rule-making powers of the first defendant under Section 254 of the 1999 Constitution are limited to the premises of the Federal High Court and do not extend to outside its perimeters which are under the exclusive responsibility of law enforcement agencies such as the Police, Department of State Services, etc.\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable court declaring the Federal High Court Practice Directions (On Trial of Terrorism Cases) 2022, unconstitutional, ultra vires, invalid, null, void, and of no effect.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nBut NEF\u2019s Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, speaking on an AIT programme, yesterday, faulted the Presidency over the way it responds to criticisms.\n\nHe said Nigeria has a problem procuring weapons because of the conduct of its armed forces and related agencies on human rights issues, its dealings with prisoners of war and citizens caught up in conflicts.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows this. They will not sell you one bullet unless they are satisfied that you\u2019ve met certain criteria. And they have raised issues over and over and over again. The Nigerian government knows this. But they need to improve the conduct of the Nigerian military, in the fight against the insurgency, against terrorists. They know this.\u201d\n\nBaba-Ahmed said rather than blame Kukah or the northern elders group, the Federal Government should ensure the country\u2019s military operations satisfy the basic standards demanded by US weapon suppliers to facilitate easy purchase of fighter jets. He tasked government to reassess the way it wages the war against insurgency and terrorism to avoid issues that lead to delays in weapons procurement from Western countries.\n\nNEF also reiterated its earlier call for President Muhammadu Buhari to resign if he is unable to resolve the nation\u2019s security problems.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cYou know, the presidency spokespersons have a way of deflecting criticism by making it personal. When you say that there is a shortfall in the quality of government, they find something to stick you with. People like Bishop Kukah and I are used to this. We don\u2019t take it seriously. This organisation should be criticised and must be criticised, and those who are ready to do so should be willing to take some of the words that Garba Shehu and Femi Adesina recycle every once in a while when we point out certain facts about the failings of the president in terms of securing the country.\u201d\n\nBaba-Ahmed who noted that it was regrettable that whoever pointed out flaws of the Buhari government is attacked by his spokespersons, said if the military does the right thing, by complying with standards set by western arms-selling countries, they would always get weapons.\n\n\u201cSo, whether it comes from Bishop Kukah or it comes from me, we made this point. We want to buy weapons from some countries, improve the way we wage this war. It can be done, it must be done if you want these weapons. You certainly don\u2019t want to go the option of some other members of the government who say procure weapons from anywhere in the world or just bring in mercenaries to fight a war for you. So, I agree with Bishop Kukah that government needs to review its attitude, some of those issues raised by countries that are creating problems, well, seemingly creating problem for us in terms of selling weapons, and that the onus is on us to improve those conditions. It is fact and we need it now.\n\n\u201cWe must not go to the 2023 elections with the current state of insecurity or a worse state of insecurity, not just because of the elections, but because life is getting worse by the day and it is time to reverse this trend. We cannot continue to live like this. Every inch of this country has one form of security challenge and there are solutions to them. It cannot be that there are no solutions to the insecurities.\n\n\u201cSo, if we can, so, if there are solutions, you have to ask, is the problem with the people who are supposed to find the solution? Are you saying that we can\u2019t deal with bandits and kidnappers and IPOB and ESN and people who are making billions of money from oil theft and using it for other illegal activities?\n\n\u201cThere must be something wrong in the way we are running the country. We should say so. We should raise our voices and demand that the people we voted into office, the president, the National Assembly, governors, they must do better. We can\u2019t live like rats hiding in holes and running away every year from criminals. We just can\u2019t. We\u2019re tired. If they can\u2019t operate the country, there is an option. There is a provision in the constitution for stepping down if you can\u2019t perform the most basic function available to you, which is to protect and secure citizens. That\u2019s what we\u2019re saying, but a few people thought that extreme, but it is a statement of fact.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*Buhari mourns over 100 persons killed in Imo explosion, says it\u2019s national disaster *Insists those responsible must be brought to justice *Directs security agencies to clamp down on oil theft\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIIn furtherance of Operation Dakatar Da Barawo (OPDDB) that was launched to checkmate crude oil theft and related acts of economic sabotage, the Nigerian Navy said it seized 6, 000, 000 litres of stolen crude oil estimated at N264 billion.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed \u201cshock and trauma\u201d about the death of over 100 people in an explosion at an illegal oil refinery in Imo State.\n\nHowever, there were no report of seized barges and motherships by the Navy, unfortunately, that is where most of the theft occur because these are the means by which stolen crude oil are being transported to international market and sold at far below the market price. And sadly this is occurring right under the nose of the security agencies some of who the government has acknowledged collude with the the criminals to shortchange the country.\n\nFollowing the alarming increase of crude oil theft, the president had directed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, to ensure that the criminal activity was brought to a halt. Buhari\u2019s directive had followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOwing to the directive, the naval troops disclosed that they recorded more arrests and seizures between April 15th and 23rd, 2022, being the third week of the operation.\n\nA statement issued by Naval Headquarters stated that the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) DELTA in Warri, deactivated an Illegal Refining Site (IRS) around Sara creek.\n\nThe IRS had 16 ovens, 16 metal storage tanks and three wide pits filled with about 500,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, as well as 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil, a generator and 4 pumping machines.\n\nAlso, the statement revealed that an IRS at Asugbo creek in Warri was discovered with six ovens, 12 metal storage tanks and five large pits all containing about 600,000 litres of stolen crude oil including 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 150,000 litres of sludge.\n\nSimilarly, sequel to series of air reconnaissance, Forward Operating Base (FOB) FORMOSO in Bayelsa State on April 19, 2022, raided an IRS at Ereweibio creek in Brass LGA.\n\nAccordingly, seven large cooking ovens, 10 large metal storage tanks and drums all laden with about 400,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and 20,000 litres of suspected illegally refined PMS were discovered.\n\nThe site also had five large pits holding approximately 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil. Equally, two pumping machines, one gasoline generator, one submersible pump and one chainsaw machine were discovered at the site and destroyed in situ.\n\nAccording to the statement, on April 21, 2022, an IRS at Lelemu creek in Warri South-West was discovered. During the operation, 19 ovens, 26 metal storage tanks and two dugout pits laden with about 250,000 litres of suspected stolen crude oil and 50,000 litres of illegally refined AGO were destroyed.\n\nTo ensure effective deactivation of IRS, NNS DELTA on 21 April 2022 conducted swamp buggy operations during which an earlier identified IRS around Egwa creek in Warri was destroyed.\n\nDuring the operation, 16 ovens, 31 metal storage tanks and seven large pits all filled with about 850,000 litres of stolen crude oil were equally deactivated.\n\nRelatedly, on 22 April 2022, around Lelemu creek in Warri South West LGA of Delta State, personnel under NNS DELTA again discovered 22 IRS ovens, 12 metallic storage tanks and 5 large pits all containing about 150,000 litres of stolen crude oil.\n\n\u201cAt another IRS off Lelemu creek, 19 ovens, 42 storage tanks and 14 large pits containing about 300,000 litres of stolen crude oil, as well as approximately 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, 100,000 litres of illegally refined DPK and 100,000 litres of suspected crude oil sludge were all destroyed,\u201d it added.\n\nIn a related development, NNS LUGARD at Kogi State in the course of OPDDB discovered an IRS on 22 April 2022, at a location off Akili-Ozizor community of Ogbaru LGA, Anambra State.\n\nDuring the operation, four locally fabricated ovens, seven metal storage tanks, four large pits of which two were for storage of about 48,000 litres of stolen crude oil were all destroyed.\n\nOn the same day, NNS VICTORY in Calabar raided tanker garage along Harbour road in the city and seized a storage tank containing about 45,000 Litres of suspected illegally refined AGO. Also, a tanker laden with 33,000 Litres of suspected locally refined AGO was seized and the owner was arrested. Furthermore, about 58 drums of locally refined AGO were also seized.\n\nAdditionally, NNS SOROH at Yenagoa, on Saturday 23 April 2022 intercepted a wooden boat at Otuokpot Area along Kolo creek.\n\n\u201cThe wooden boat was laden with 60,000Litres of illegally refined AGO together with over 100 sacks of same product. Items on the boat which included one pumping machine, one Yamaha 40HP outboard engine and one locally made boat Anchor with the products were destroyed at Ogbia waterside,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe base also conducted a search on a Market Boat heading for St Nicolas Axis from Akassa area.\n\nAbout 2,500 litres of suspected illegally refined products stored in gallons and sacks were hidden inside the boat. Accordingly, same were evacuated for destruction. Likewise on the same day, personnel under NNS DELTA on patrol around Jones creek in Warri South West LGA raided an IRS and discovered 33 ovens, 42 metal storage tanks and seven wide pits all filled with about 1,200,000 litres of stolen crude oil, 250,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 100,000 litres of sludge.\n\nFurthermore, combing of the area off Jones creek led to the discovery of another IRS with five ovens, two metal storage tanks and eight large pits with about 150,000 litres of sludge. Both IRS off Jones creek with the discovered items and products were destroyed in situ.\n\nThe statement affirmed that over 6,000,000 litres of products valued over N3 billion from oil thieves and economic saboteurs.\n\n\u201cThe migration by operators of IRS from the South South geopolitical zone to the South East also come to the fore. \u201cThis development will in no way deter the Nigerian Navy from ensuring zero tolerance for COT, IRS, illegal bunkering and related economic crimes in the Nation\u2019s maritime environment and adjoining territory\u201d, it said.\n\nBuhari Mourns Over 100 Persons Killed in Imo Illegal Refinery Explosion, Says It\u2019s National Disaster\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Mr. Garba Shehu, Buhari, who described the unfortunate incident that occurred in Ohaji/Egbema of Imo State as a, \u201ccatastrophe and a national disaster,\u201d called on the security agencies to intensify their clampdown on oil theft.\n\nMany people were reportedly burnt beyond recognition by the explosion. It was learnt that the police were now looking for the owner of the unlawful refinery.\n\nDozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire.\n\nThe death toll continued to rise as emergency workers went through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) told the British media organisation, BBC Igbo, that the number killed now stood at 109.\n\n\u201cWe learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\u201d Nnaji said.\n\nWhile offering his condolences to the families of the victims, the president demanded that those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice.\n\nIn the statement, titled, \u201cImo \u2018Refinery\u2019 Deaths, a National Disaster,\u201d Buhari urged community leaders and the security personnel in the area to prevent a reoccurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed the nation\u2019s armed forces, security and intelligence agencies to intensify the clampdown on illegal refineries following the reported deaths of tens of people Friday night after an illegal refinery exploded at Abaezi forest in the Ohaji-Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cReacting to what he described as a catastrophe and a national disaster, Buhari said responsibility for the loss of lives and property must squarely lie with the sponsors of the illegal refinery, who must all be caught and made to face justice.\n\n\u201cIn conveying the condolences and the full depth and range of the nation\u2019s shock and trauma to the families of the victims, the Ohaji/Egbema community and the government and people of Imo State, the president urged community leaders, the police, and the secret service to never allow the occurrence of the heart-breaking incident in any part of the country again.\u201d\n\nThe damage to fishing and farming in oil-rich communities caused by the oil industry over the decades has led some to find other ways to make money from the oil business. Illegal refining is attractive in some oil-producing communities, as it is seen as somewhat easy to manage, despite efforts to halt the practice.\n\nThe authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened overnight into Saturday, but accidents like this have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.\n\nThere have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria\u2019s official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country, and making the unlawful business very lucrative.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Tambuwal: Tell us who the elders are, \u2026we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible\n\n*Saraki: It\u2019s a welcome development, painstaking efforts\n\n*Mohammed commends IBB, says recommendation not an imposition\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauch\n\nThe ripples generated by the consensus report of some northern elders, which endorsed former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and the Bauchi State governor as the preferred Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) northern presidential candidates, assumed another dimension yesterday after the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), umbrella body for the northern establishment, dissociated itself from the initiative with an effort to correct certain misgivings.\n\nThis is as some of those concerned have also continued to state their own accounts of what happened, while the others, defended and justified the report, authored by Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nWhile, the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who had maintained a rebellious stance since inception, queried who the northern elders commissioned General Ibrahim Babangida were, Saraki, on his part, commended the report, stating it was a thorough and painstaking efforts that ought to be commended by all.\n\nMohammed too commended the former military president and explained that the report was not an imposition.\n\nOn the contrary, a group known as the United Arewa Youth For Justice and Development, has thrown its weight behind the decision of the northern elders over the endorsement of Mohammed and Saraki as northern presidential consensus candidates of the PDP ahead of the 2023, presidential primaries of the party.\n\nHowever, NEF, in a statement by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the forum was not involved in the process as a body, it further insisted it was not affiliated to any political party or aspirant as it were, adding that the idea to engineer a consensus among the aspirants was that of the aspirants themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make clear that the entire process did not involve the Northern Elders Forum as a group, and is not a product of the group. It has become necessary to address the impression created in part by mischief, and in part by genuine confusion over the role of the Convener of Northern Elders Forum, in the efforts to create consensus among four aspirants for the Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\n\u201cNorthern Elders Forum is not affiliated to any political party or aspirant, and is strongly committed to the creation of a level playing field, which will allow the emergence of the best leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe forum stated that, it has also remained consistent in its conviction that all parts of the country should play their parts freely, unhindered by restrictions, which offend principles of inclusion and fairness, adding that, the North has excellent candidates whose fate should be left to party delegates and voters to decide.\n\nIt further maintained that it remained united behind the protection and projection of interests of the North and Nigeria, and would play its role as it has always done whenever the circumstances demanded.\n\nTambuwal, speaking with newsmen, queried the report saying, \u201cTell us who are the elders that sat down to come up with that decision? Who are the people that gave advice to reach that conclusion? Nobody has this information.\n\n\u201cI consulted the party leadership across the country especially, the Northern PDP leaders but no one is aware what\u2019s going on, indicating that something fishy is going on. If not, we are the ones that took ourselves to them to help the process, and later withdrew, why should anyone insist the process of consensus must continue?\n\n\u201cSo, based on this, I didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in anyway reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters. I am not involved in any of such. I am still in the race, I am seeking victory from GOD and in his mercy, God will give me,\u201d he stated.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWe discussed the possibility of agreeing on one candidate within our group to represent us (Initially not even to represent the whole North) and we all agreed based on the situation of the party.\n\n\u201cWe started consultations based on that, and the fourth person that joined us is also another presidential aspirant Mohammad Hayatou-deen. In order for people not to perceive that may be we are trying to fight the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, we also went to consult him and seek his blessings.\n\n\u201cHe was happy about it but he didn\u2019t show any interest to join us. That was how we continued our consultations. Along the line, we discussed that we really need an elder in the country, who will help us reach our goal amicably in case we may encounter any disagreement along the line within ourselves and we all agreed that we should take the matter to former president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida in Minna.\n\n\u201cWe explained to him and he immediately agreed. He was very happy. And he promised to do his best to help us achieve our mission. However, we had to at a point tell ourselves the truth. The four of us met in Bauchi State government diplomatic House in Abuja on Wednesday, we looked into the issue from all angles and we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible and we cannot continue the process, everyone should embark on independent struggle, and whosoever GOD gives the ticket to, its ok.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that senator Bukola Saraki will organise a press conference and inform the public about the outcome. Without consulting us, Bukola Saraki on his own sent us message that we need to go to Minna and see Babangida after all that wasn\u2019t part of what we agreed upon in our meeting. I communicated with Governor of Bauchi Bala Mohammed whether he received same message which he did.\n\n\u201cWe went and met Bukola Saraki. But at that point, I made it categorically clear to them that for the sake of GOD, that we didn\u2019t agree on that; our agreement was that consensus candidate isn\u2019t possible, why should we go and suffer that old man again?\n\n\u201cAnd that I will not go to Minna. Why should they be in a hurry. It isn\u2019t something urgent. Reconciliation and consensus arrangement can be achieved even lately on the elections ground on the day of election. Why the hurry? Our initial plan was to expand our consultations and make the consensus candidate even at national level before we realised that it isn\u2019t possible, even in our group let alone be at national level.\n\n\u201cBut they insisted we have to go to Minna and discuss the issue with Babangida. They were so in a hurry. And to our surprise, the consensus they agreed on yielded two candidates, the two of them not even one. That\u2019s an indication something fishy is going on, and I understand that already. Go and ask the three of them. We met on Wednesday and we agreed to bury the issue of consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cHow come Babangida and the Northern elders he invited would impose it on us after all we took ourselves to him, and we later withdrew,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut Saraki, through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyanu, described the report of the consensus as thorough and painstaking in reaching the decision.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cIt is a welcome development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent. One needs to commend and appreciate the elders, who worked to actualise the process.\n\n\u201cMay Allah bless them all. Their decision was based on equity, justice, and need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process, which can help the party later on. The process is a work-in-progress.\n\n\u201cOne person will still emerge from the on-going process here in the North. The South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East.\n\n\u201cA nation like Nigeria with all the current problems needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nMohammed, in a statement by his campaign spokesperson, Prof Udenta Udenta, said, \u201cOn Wednesday 20th April, 2022 Gen. Ibrahim Babangida GCFR, through the channel of the platform he inaugurated, announced Senator Bala Mohammed and Senator Bukola Saraki as the selected Consensus Aspirants.\n\n\u201cThe Senator Bala Mohammed Presidential Campaign Organisation will thus like to place on record its eternal gratitude to President Ibrahim Babangida, GCFR and the entirety of Northern Elders, who assisted him in reaching this decision.\n\n\u201cOur deep appreciation to them stems less from the fact that Senator Mohammed is among the two selected consensus aspirants and more on their Labour of thankless patriotic duty and uncommon leadership in attempting to bring order and coherence to bear in a condition of acute political uncertainty and fractured political process. We thank you our leaders from the depth of our heart.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached or lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a Consensus Presidential Aspirant. Rather, it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, RT Hon Aminu Tambuwal. Senator Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a Consensus Presidential Aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe above four named individuals not only initiated the Consensus Arrangement on their own volition but also agreed to fully and unequivocally abide by the decision that Gen Babangida will arrive at in consultation with other elders as well as accept, honour the steps and procedures he will deploy in arriving at any decision.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reject the current insinuations in the media from some quarters that purport that Gen Babangida and the elders either did not consult very widely or imposed a decision on an unwilling band of presidential aspirants. Gen Babangida and elders deserve nothing but commendation for the conclusions they reached and the outcome of the Consensus exercise by anybody, who believes in the tenets of truth, honour and integrity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the northern elders are scheduled to meet today in Asokoro, Abuja, to deliberate on the consensus report and the Wednesday planned NEC meeting of the PDP,\n\nBut the Arewa Youth, in a press statement by Suleiman Abubakar, the Director, Public Affairs, stated: \u201cAs we embark on the second phase of this critical assignment, the two aspirants chosen by our elders should work together with the support of other major stakeholders and decide on which of them should emerge as the sole consensus PDP northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe criteria used by the elders, revealed that the North-East in terms of zonal assessment have been considered as Governor Bala Mohammed was not the only individual from the zone, hence factors of equity, Justice and fairness should not be ignored in any attempt as we continue on this historic efforts.\n\n\u201cTo this end, with Bala Mohammed as northern consensus candidate, the rest of Nigerians will understand that as northerners, we have done justice to ourselves as Bala is a detribalised leader, who has been tested and trusted as former minister of the federal capital territory, an achiever per excellence as an incumbent governor of Bauchi state.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of readiness demonstrated by his Excellency, Bala Mohammed, since his endorsement by our elders to lead discussion with all other aspirants in the PDP with a view to having a national consensus if possible, is encouraging and this tells us that he is the man for the job, if we truly want to succeed,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Blue line at 90% completion\n\n*Laments vandalism of rail equipment\n\n\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, inspected the on-going construction of the Lagos Rail Line project and said the first quarter 2023 target for commencement of operational service was sacrosanct. Sanwo-Olu said the state was on track with its effort to complete work on both the Blue and Red lines rail projects, which are intra-city, to strengthen the intermodal transportation system.\n\nSpeaking at the Marina Station of the system after the inspection, Sanwo-Olu expressed satisfaction with the level of construction so far, saying additional trains are to be procured for speedy commencement.\n\nThe governor, however, warned those that had started vandalising the barricades around rail line to desist from the act, saying the tracks are hazardous. He added that, unlike the Red Line along Ikeja, Alagbado to Marina axis, the Blue Line from Marina to Mile 2 would be electric and people, including passengers, were not expected to walk on the tracks.\n\nHe said work on the Blue Line rail project was at 90 per cent completion, as contractors were working seven days a week so that Lagosians could start using the train by the first quarter of 2023.\n\nSanwo-Olu inspected the Blue line rail project alongside some of his cabinet members, top officials of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), and contractors handling the project. They moved from the National Arts Theatre rail station on a construction track to Orile Iganmu, Alaba and Mile 2 stations to inspect the four train stations on the Blue line rail.\n\nThe governor said the blue line rail would be running on electric tracks with Electric Motor Vehicle (EMV) and warned citizens to keep off the train lines.\n\nHe also inspected a new four-coach train, which, according to him, was a typical train that will be used on the blue line.\n\nHe disclosed the Lagos State government\u2019s plan to bring additional two sets of four-train coaches from China between September and October, adding that adequate security would be put in place at every train station and platform with the use of CCTV.\n\nSanwo-Olu told his entourage, \u201cThis is the first time I am taking you on the blue line to see where we are. The first phase of the Blue line rail project starts from Mile 2 and terminates at Marina. Marina Station is an elevated station and it stretches out to outer Marina and terminates where the Governor\u2019s residence is. At the end of the station, you could see that the track is broken into two bridges. The backtrack is for parking.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the contractors are working seven days a week. The major aspect, apart from the Marina Station, is a sea crossing from Eko Bridge to join the outer Marina. They would finish it in about three months. And by the time we will be coming back in July, the concrete construction should have been completed.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu condemned the level of vandalism along the rail corridors and warned perpetrators to desist from such evil acts.\n\nHe said the government would go after companies that purchased vandalised rail track infrastructure, adding that culprits will be traced and made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanwo-Olu yesterday issued a three-day ultimatum to traders under the Apogbon Bridge on Lagos Island to vacate or risk demolition of the space by Wednesday. He gave the warning while driving on the bridge during his inspection of the blue line rail project and observed that traders were back under the bridge with their goods displayed after they were driven away in the aftermath of a fire outbreak under the bridge about six weeks ago.\n\nThe governor said enforcement agencies would be deployed to the bridge after the ultimatum.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Denounce Babangida-backed Ango Abdullahi\u2019s report *PDP summons NEC meeting Wednesday *Tinubu, Umahi, others hosted by Aisha Buhari at Iftar\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Dutse\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal; former Governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, have rejected the emergence of a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed as the consensus presidential candidates for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the North.\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, Lamido, and Hayatu-Deen, who are all PDP presidential aspirants, have also denounced the report of Prof. Ango Abdullahi, which endorsed Saraki and Mohammed as the North\u2019s consensus presidential candidates with the backing of a former military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd).\n\nAs the controversy over the northern PDP presidential candidate deepens, the wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political divide at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThis is coming as the PDP yesterday summoned a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for Wednesday this week.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, \u201call members of the National Executive Committee of our great party are invited to the 96th NEC meeting\u201d scheduled to hold at the NEC Hall PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, at 2p.m.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the NEC meeting, which would take a final decision on the report of the 37-man committee on the zoning of presidential ticket of the party, was shifted from Thursday last week to Wednesday this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political parties divides at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe First Lady invited all presidential aspirants of all political parties, to the Ramadan Iftar, where he also hosted elected officials of the political parties.\n\nPresidential aspirants in attendance were: National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State (APC), and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nOther dignitaries include: Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; one-time National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Barnabas Gemade; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara; and oil and gas mogul, Tein Jack-Rich.\n\nOn the issue of the northern PDP presidential candidate, Abdullahi, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, had in a report said that Babangida had directed him to conduct a consensus exercise for four northern presidential aspirants \u2013 Saraki, Mohammed, Tambuwal, and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe report, which shortlisted Saraki and Governor Mohammed as the two northern presidential consensus candidates, urged Tambuwal and the investment banker and economist, Hayatu-Deen to drop their presidential ambition.\n\nThe report signed by Abdullahi said: \u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\u201d\n\nThe report also recommended that: \u201cThe two would, in turn, be required to make further concessions so that in the end, one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate, out of the four that presented themselves from the North.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi noted in the report that the four northern aspirants had visited Babangida and gave him the mandate to lead the process for a consensus and also agreed to abide by the outcome of the decision.\n\n\u201cThe former president encouraged the aspirants to have a resolution within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one out of the four, General Babangida on his part opted for inclusion, through wider consultation and assigned me to design criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with elders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\n\n\u201cThe process was conducted in the following three stages. In the first phase, the opinions of six distinguished persons each from the three geopolitical zones were sought with regards to each of the four aspirants, Each of the zonal delegates was allocated two votes to choose the first and second choice making a total of 36 votes overall. The outcome of that consultation was as follows:\n\n\u201c7 votes for the candidate (A) Aminu Waziri; 10 votes for the candidate (B) Bala Mohammed; 10 votes for the candidate (C) A-B Saraki; and five votes for the candidate (D), M Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the elders deferred his votes on grounds of continuing consultations with traditional rulers and other major stakeholders.\n\nThe report also stated that two members did not cast their second ballots bringing the total to 32 votes cast out of 36.\n\nIn its recommendation, which was approved by Babangida, the report endorsed Saraki and the Bauchi State governor.\n\nThe report also thanked all the aspirants and \u201cformer President Ibrahim Babangida for entrusting them with the conduct of this exercise and in the hope that all parties involved would continue with mutual consultations aimed at the overall success of the party.\n\n\u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Bala Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\n\n\u201cThe successful aspirants are hereby urged to work together to make allowance for further consultations to foster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancour-free primary election in which all eligible candidates would be free to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely commend the sportsmanship and statesmanship exhibited throughout the exercise by all those involved and urge continuous cooperation and teamwork to ensure victory for the party,\u201d the report explained.\n\nBut in a swift response, the Technical Committee for the Actualisation of Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Presidency in 2023, has dissociated the former vice president from the consensus arrangement. Atiku\u2019s Technical Committee, in its statement, noted that: \u201cThe report clearly stated that the aspirants who presented themselves for the exercise are: Governor Tambuwal, Governor Mohammed, Saraki, and Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nThe statement insisted that Atiku was never a part of the purported consensus arrangement and did not subject himself to this process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he is not bound by any of the recommendations and conclusions of the purported report. Waziri Atiku Abubakar as a nationalist strongly believes that Nigeria has never been so divided as it is today, and any regional, zonal, ethnoreligious gang-up or consensus-driven in this manner will further deepen and widen the wounds that urgently require to be healed,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement issued yesterday, the Director of Organisation and Mobilisation for Tambuwal Campaign Organisation, Nicholas Msheliza has also stated that the Sokoto State governor was not part of the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organisation (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger State.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.\n\nThe correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Senator Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm on the same day was aborted unilaterally by Senator Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, April 21, 2022, the same Senator Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday. Governor Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Governor Tambuwal was absent at the Friday meeting in Minna. As a result, therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Governor Tambuwal, who had earlier informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement added that Tambuwal had submitted his Presidential nomination forms, adding that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four had collapsed.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Sokoto State governor will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primary.\n\nAlso denouncing the controversial consensus report, former Jigawa State Governor, Lamido called on all members of the party in the northern states to ignore it.\n\nLamido, in a statement issued yesterday, argued that the report does not represent the opinions of members of the party in the 19 northern states.\n\n\u201cThe attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the northern states is drawn to reports in the media that some northern elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cHaving widely consulted party leaders across the 19 northern states and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what Is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North!\n\n\u201cDiscussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our party to have a national consensus if possible or at least working towards having smooth acrimony-free National Convention. The position of the northern elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the northern aspirants,\u201d Lamido explained.\n\nIn his reaction, Hayatu-Deen, in a statement by his campaign office, also stated that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed.\n\n\u201cThe candidates involved could not reach a compromise amongst themselves, resulting in the decision of our principal, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal to discontinue the process,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt described the committee constituted by Abdullahi as completely faceless and the evaluation criteria subjective.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that this entire charade was designed to achieve a preconceived outcome,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Leaders mourn monarch\n\n\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan have mourned the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, who died on Friday night at the age of 83, after 52 years on the throne.\n\nThe remains of Oba Adeyemi, who passed on at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, were committed to mother earth last night according to Islamic and traditional rites.\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar; National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, Governors Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun) and Gboyega Oyetola (Osun) have also paid glowing tributes to the late monarch.\n\n\n\nThe Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade II; the Emir of Ilorin and Chairman Kwara State Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari; and the Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has also mourned the death of the Oyo monarch.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement issued yesterday by his Media Adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, stressed that the Alaafin of Oyo\u2019s 52 years of rule was remarkable in many ways, most significant was the emphasis he placed on human development, thereby encouraging learning as a culture and formal education as a necessity while promoting values of peace and stability.\n\n\n\nAs a highly revered traditional ruler, President Buhari noted the late monarch\u2019s numerous involvements in national meetings and conferences to shape the future of the country, and the living words of wisdom he shared at every opportunity on unity and people-focused governance.\n\nIn his letter of condolence sent to Makinde, Obasanjo said Oba Adeyemi died \u201cat a crucial stage in our nation\u2019s history when his wise counsel and rich experience are greatly needed.\u201d\n\nA copy of the letter was made available to journalists yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by Obasanjo\u2019s Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi.\n\n\n\nThe former president described the monarch as a symbol of a nation\u2019s epic struggle for self-discovery and self-actualisation.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Twitter has accepted Elon Musk\u2019s offer to purchase the company for roughly $44 billion. The social media platform disclosed in a press release today that Musk purchased the company at $54.20 a share, the same price named in his initial offer on April 14, 2022.\n\nBret Taylor, Twitter\u2019s Independent Board Chair, said in the press release that the board had \u201cconducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\u2019s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nWhen Musk, the world\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $219 billion, made his initial offer, Twitter\u2019s board created a poison pill, a defense tactic used by a target company to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover, hinting that it would reject Musk\u2019s offer. News of today\u2019s acceptance shows that the board has changed its stance.\n\nOn April 21, Musk shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he planned to finance the purchase by securing $25.5 billion of debt and about $21 billion equity commitment.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in the statement announcing the acquisition.\n\nHe also hinted at upcoming changes he might implement at the company, adding that he wants to \u201cmake Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what impact Musk will ultimately have on Twitter, where he\u2019ll start making his proposed changes, or when. He\u2019s recently taken to using the platform to poll users about the creation of an edit button, for example, which Twitter had already been developing at the time. In the initial SEC filing, Musk expressed his plan to take the company private. He also shared during a recent TED interview that he wants to make the Twitter algorithm open-sourced, allowing people around the world to make suggestions and notice changes made to tweets.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s CEO, appeared to support the move, saying in the press release that \u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, Twitter users didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the platform to share their predictions, concerns, and of course, hot takes on the matter.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the new owner of Twitter deal with fake accounts, spam bots and authenticating all human beings of this platform.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIt\u2019s the start of a new week, and I hope you had a good time. How was your weekend? Did you use my tips on Friday?\n\nI had a few conversations over the weekend, but one, in particular, stood out for me, and I believe it will be helpful to you, so I\u2019ll share.\n\nBlueroomcare, an online mental health platform, has announced a partnership with RelianceHMO to provide customised wellness plans at no cost to the employer or their employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Blueroomcare will provide mental health services to Reliance\u2019s customers. Customers, on the other hand, will need to know whether or not they qualify for therapy.\n\nFollowing my experience in February, I think this is a step in the right direction. I had contacted Reliance hoping that they would cover a mental health illness different from depression. I desperately needed the services of a therapist at that time.\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed me for a while, you\u2019ve probably noticed that I believe therapy is beneficial. Talking to someone you can trust relieves you, and a therapist helps clarify issues, explore options, develop strategies, and raise self-awareness.\n\nIf Blueroomcare\u2019s therapists are as qualified as they claim, this collaboration should yield positive results. I mean, following the #HorribleBosses trend on Twitter, another online mental health platform was literally dragged. Some of its customers claim that some of their therapists were unprofessional.\n\nAnyway, remember that your mental health is just as important as your physical and sexual health. So, while we raise a glass to a healthy and productive week, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nEquiano: A faster Internet connection\n\nWave\u2019s e-money licence\n\nEquiano: A faster Internet connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s Submarine Cable ship\n\nThis week looks wonderful. It\u2019s palpable, isn\u2019t it? Of course I have my reasons, and I\u2019ll share one with you.\n\nHere it is: Equiano, a cutting-edge submarine Internet cable, is set to arrive in Lagos, Nigeria, on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nFunded by Google, the Internet cable has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes) and is named after Olaudah Equiano, the historical abolitionist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tech behemoth, it will have 20 times the power and durability of the lat cable built to serve the West African region.\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? On average, your current mobile download speed is 18.7 Mbps. However, Google claims Equiano will provide 6x faster Internet, putting you above or below 112 Mbps.\n\nYou\u2019re still not getting it, are you? Let\u2019s try a scenario: A 1GB file will take more than 7 minutes to download at the current download speed of 18.7 Mbps. But Google\u2019s Internet cable could help reduce the download time to 1.2 minutes. Isn\u2019t this fascinating?\n\nClose your eyes for a moment and think about what this means for you if you work from home or rely on the Internet.\n\nWhat am I typing? Who doesn\u2019t rely on the Internet these days? Okay, maybe not everyone, but about a half of the Nigerian population does. Per Statista, Nigeria had 104 million active Internet users as of January 2021, accounting for roughly half of the total population.\n\nConsider what this means for the country\u2019s 104 million Internet users. Isn\u2019t it massive? I\u2019ll save you the trouble of imagining. Our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, provided an interesting viewpoint on what this means for you and how it can work.\n\nYou can read it here: What you need to know as Google\u2019s Equiano cable lands In Nigeria\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This was announced last Friday, April 22, 2022.\n\nThis e-money licence means Wave can now offer its current financial products to customers independently and directly, without the assistance of third-party banks.\n\nRecall that since its launch in 2018, Wave\u2019s mobile money business model has been powered by third-party banks like United Bank of Africa (UBA) and Ecobank.\n\nThe permit was issued by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), a central bank that serves the eight francophone West Africa countries that comprise the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).\n\nWhat exactly does the startup do? Wave offers free bill payments, free cash-in and cash-out, and a 1% transfer fee, making it roughly 70% cheaper than its competitors\u2019 traditional pricing structures.\n\nRemember that on Tuesday, September 7, 2021, the startup became the first Francophone Africa Unicorn after raising a $200 million Series A round at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nAnd now, with the licence, Wave will be able to offer a broader range of financial services, like merchant payments, savings, credit, and remittances, in collaboration with other partners in the WAEMU financial ecosystem.\n\nHowever, for now, the licence only applies to Wave\u2019s operations in Senegal. But, they hope to extend this licence very quickly to the other WAEMU countries so that its customer base in the region can benefit equally.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

Second, send a shout-out to Ogheneruemu, my copy editor. She does an excellent job with the newsletter.\n\nSo, how did your week go? I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

Rivers State Commissioner of Commerce and Industry, Ifeyinwa Nwankpa, represented Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after the opening, the CEO who left Sterling Bank to pilot Premium Trust explained that the bank operates within the same rules and within limits allowed by the regulators. However, it is the strategic method or style of delivering on products that set a bank apart.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be deliberate about it.

This for us, is a journey that ensures we grow together with our customers, impact lives and build communities consistent with our tagline \u2013 Together for Growth,\u201d said Emefienim.\n\nOn expansion, he said the bank is unique and that its expansion plan had been endorsed by the regulator.

          "text": "Who will be the next president of the most populous black nation on earth come 2023? No one knows, but there is a feeling that in 2023, a new leader will occupy the Villa. Will the forthcoming elections automatically change all that is negative with Nigeria?\n\nIt is not impossible but it all depends on the type of leaders that will emerge after the next general elections.\n\nThe list of presidential aspirants in the popular political parties \u2013 PDP and APC \u2013 is swelling. Gubernatorial aspirations are countless. But Nigeria is seriously in need of committed leaders at all levels of government.\n\nFor many years, one can hardly see a few committed leaders in the polity. And it is doubtful if Nigeria\u2019s democracy of more than 20 years has groomed committed leaders with shared vision in quality and quantity to bring about the positive effect that we crave for in 2023. Honestly, we need committed leaders to rebuild Nigeria.\n\nWe were far more productive in 1980 than we are today. And it is because we are not productive that we have revenue challenges. In the 1980s Nigeria\u2019s economy was rapidly growing because we were a net exporter of refined petroleum products\n\nThere is no doubt that Nigeria is a country endowed with enormous human and natural resources. Nigeria, the most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, has produced the wealthiest black man and woman in the world. Nigeria is endowed with many men and women with cerebral aptitude.\n\nBarely four decades ago, our exchange rate was: $1 = N0.8. Are you surprised? Please, do not be surprised. Why? We were far more productive in 1980 than we are today. And it is because we are not productive that we have revenue challenges.\n\nIn the 1980s Nigeria\u2019s economy was rapidly growing because we were a net exporter of refined petroleum products. Today, we import all our refined petroleum products. The endeavour known as \u201cfuel subsidy\u201d is to gulp about N4 trillion in 2022 because we cannot refine our petroleum products. All government refineries are dead.\n\nWhen we had all the characteristics of an emerging economy with potential for industrialization in early 1980s, we rode in locally assembled cars, buses and trucks. Peugeot cars in Kaduna and Volkswagen cars in Lagos.\n\nLeyland produced trucks/buses in Ibadan and ANAMCO in Enugu also produced buses and trucks. Steyr in Bauchi produced our Agricultural tractors and military vehicles. It was not just Assembly, we were producing many of the spare parts.\n\nVono, a company in Lagos, produced the vehicle seats. While Exide in Ibadan produced the batteries, not just for Nigeria but for the entire West Africa. Some firms in Ibadan produced the windshields, brake pads and discs.\n\nDunlop produced Tyres in Lagos and Mitchelin Tyres were produced in Port Harcourt. The raw materials needed to produce most of these tyres were from rubber plantations located in Ogun, Bendel and Rivers states.\n\nWe were listening to Radio and watching television sets assembled in Ibadan by Sanyo. We were using refrigerators, freezers and Airconditioners assembled and produced by Thermocool and Debo Electrical.\n\nMost Nigerians were putting on clothes produced from textile Mills in Kaduna and other parts of Nigeria. Then most fabrics were not from imported cotton but from cotton grown in Nigeria. Most of the textile mills have been shutdown as a result of poor electricity supply.\n\nOur water was running through pipes produced by Kwalipipe in Kano and Duraplast in Lagos. Most of the water closets in bathrooms and restrooms were produced locally. Our electricity was flowing through cables produced by the Nigerian Wire and Cable, Ibadan; NOCACO in Kaduna and Kablemetal in Lagos and Port Harcourt.\n\nWe had Bata and Lennards Stores producing the shoes we were putting on. The shoes were not from imported leather but from locally tanned leather in Kaduna.\n\nWe were mainly flying our Airways, (the Nigeria Airways), to most places in the world. Nigerian National Shipping Line had many merchant ships involved in maritime trade. These ships are no more.\n\nThe Nigerian Airways was about the biggest in Africa at the time. Most of the foods we ate were grown or produced in Nigeria. Suddenly most of these firms closed down either due to mismanagement or policy inconsistencies of various governments over time. Nigeria got to a point in history when citizens imported almost everything including toothpicks. Isn\u2019t this alarming?\n\nAs we write this article, Nigeria\u2019s talented and brilliant youths who should be involved in nation-building are rapidly escaping to other nations where it\u2019s not stressful to make a living. Do we care? It seems that those in authority do not bother much.\n\nToday, the country cannot feed her poor citizens and keep her people safe. A lot of funds have been committed to ensuring that there is constant electricity power supply and security.\n\nThe security we have not been able to provide while it is difficult to sustain power supply to households and factories. The government has improved the railway system through borrowed funds. But the Abuja- Kaduna bound train was attacked. Public education from the primary to the tertiary levels need complete overhaul.\n\nIn the face of these numerous challenges, committed leaders are scarce. All we can see is a gale of political defection by politicians. We see some politicians display political grandstanding.\n\nNo meaningful debate about how to create wealth and change the negative narrative of the country. All we hear daily is that political parties are interested in consensus candidacy. We have not been told by most politicians how they are going to open doors of opportunities for millions of our youths that are jobless.\n\nCommitted leadership is the only prescription for change. We strongly believe that committed leaders have a continual passion for a difference in the lives of the citizens through good governance.\n\nHave you seen a committed leader before? A committed leader will have good attitude with a vision on how to turn things around in the positive direction and must be able to walk the talk. The \u201cchange\u201d that we voted for in 2015 has been assessed by many analysts as \u201cbarely average\u201d because of security and economic challenges we face today.\n\nRead also: Saving Abia from the political locusts in 2023\n\nThis article is not to castigate any political office holder neither is it to crucify any politician. It is to remind our politicians that the next general elections should be an opportunity for us to refit the country and rejig almost every component of our national life that is below the mark. Is it our constitution?\n\nWe need to have a constitution that reflects the wishes and aspirations of the people with our diversity. The attitude of the ruled have to be recalibrated for wealth creation and economic development.\n\nIf we do not address squarely all those flawed fundamentals that have brought the nation on its knees, and why investors \u2013 local and foreign- not investing sufficiently in the economy, then the struggle continues. We must find ways and means to reduce the rate at which Nigerian professionals are scurrying away from the country.\n\nOtherwise, the preparations for the next elections in 2023 are not likely to yield positive results. We will still waste our precious time debating issues of hunger, poverty, insecurity, national grid collapse, kidnappings and other ills that do not bring prosperity to the citizens. Those aspiring for elective positions in 2023 should tell Nigerians what they have got to offer. Thank you.",
          "summary": "For many years, one can hardly see a few committed leaders in the polity.\nAnd it is doubtful if Nigeria\u2019s democracy of more than 20 years has groomed committed leaders with shared vision in quality and quantity to bring about the positive effect that we crave for in 2023.\nWhile Exide in Ibadan produced the batteries, not just for Nigeria but for the entire West Africa.\nSome firms in Ibadan produced the windshields, brake pads and discs.\nWe strongly believe that committed leaders have a continual passion for a difference in the lives of the citizens through good governance.",

          "text": "2023 Election: I can only contest if I am endorsed by the President-Jonathan\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nGroups reject Jonathan\u2019s candidacy in APC\n\nAspirants looking for consensus are lazy \u2013 Tinubu group\n\nSupport groups working for some presidential aspirants of the party have rejected the consultation between former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress for Jonathan to emerge as the presidential candidate.\n\nGroups loyal to the APC National leader and former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; have terminated the consensus plot for the ex-President.\n\nOther members of the party in the presidential race include the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello and the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi.\n\nThe NIGERIAN OBSERVER gathered that Jonathan had informed some APC leaders that he would only join the presidential race if he was directly endorsed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nEarlier The NIGERIAN OBSERVER reported that Jonathan\u2019s posters flooded the national secretariat of the APC and some youth groups stormed Jonathan\u2019s office in the Maitama area of Abuja, calling on him to join the Presidential race.\n\nIn his response, the former President had told protesters that he could not say for sure if he would declare or not but only advised his supporters to \u201cwatch out.\u201d\n\nA member of the APC National Executive Committee who pleaded anonymity said all presidential aspirants were aware of the plan to bring Jonathan in as the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, he said that members of the Presidency cabal who were working on the plan were not sure whether it would succeed.\n\nThe party chieftain stated, \u201cI can tell you they are facing a tough task as far as Jonathan is concerned. Although from his body language, one can see that Jonathan is interested. However, his backers in the APC are confused about how to launder the public image of Jonathan whom they painted incompetent and clueless in 2015.\n\n\u201cAnother tough task the party may face is how it will convince other aspirants like Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi, Umahi and Bello to step down. Many members are not happy with the plot and are ready to shoot it down.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Leader, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, Ekiti State, Femi Adeleye, said on Sunday that the party could not give Jonathan a waiver to contest the presidential election as a consensus candidate when there were competent and capable aspirants already.\n\nAdeleye who said the presidential aspirants were already preparing for an indirect primary, however, said the party would adopt Osinbajo in case it considered a consensus arrangement.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEven at that, if all the contestants agree within themselves and decide to step down for one of them, I am very comfortable that our principal, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, will be the one they will step down for. I am very comfortable with that.\n\n\u201cIf some people are rooting for Jonathan, the party must accept him first. And for him to contest, he must have spent a year in the party and our primary will hold in the one month\u2019s time. It will be very difficult for the party to say they want to give him a waiver and pick him as consensus candidate when there are competent hands already on the ground.\u201d\n\nIn a swift response, the South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 known as SWAGA 2023, said that there was no possibility of a consensus presidential candidate in the upcoming primary election.\n\nThe Chairman of SWAGA 2023, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, said, \u201cThe candidates for the presidential election await the primaries and the people will have to earn it. Don\u2019t forget that under the new electoral law, you can only have consensus when all the candidates or aspirants have agreed in writing and I don\u2019t see that happening. Those who are looking for consensus are the lazy ones who have not done any work.\n\n\u201cWe are working and hoping to have free and fair primaries which I know that by the grace of the almighty God, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will easily win. So, the issue of consensus candidacy should be forgotten completely. Nobody will impose the president on Nigeria, the party members will choose their candidates by themselves at the convention and the Nigerian people will be given the opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice in February next year.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye said the Presidential primary would not be like the national convention of March 26 because the primary is more complicated as it would involve a wider electorate.\n\nThe leader of the Grassroot Network for Asiwaju Tinubu group, Mr Abiodun Mafe, also said that Jonathan was not known to be a member of the APC hence he could not be the presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cJonathan has never been a member of the APC, so how will it be possible for anyone to say that he will be made a consensus candidate? Until he now proves to the whole world that he is a card-carrying member of the APC, it can\u2019t be. Even at that, there is a process. Constitutionally, anybody who is a member of the APC has the right to contest but as far as I am concerned Jonathan is not a part,\u201d Mafe stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, on Monday, struck a deal oto buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion.\n\nTwitter agreed to sell itself to Mr. Musk for $54.20 a share, a 38 percent premium over the company\u2019s share price this month before he revealed he was the firm\u2019s single largest shareholder.\n\nIt would be the largest deal to take a company private \u2014 something Mr. Musk has said he will do with Twitter \u2014 in at least two decades, according to data compiled by Dealogic.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a statement announcing the deal. \u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\u201d\n\nThe deal, which has been unanimously approved by Twitter\u2019s board, is expected to close this year, subject to a vote of Twitter shareholders and certain regulatory approvals.\n\nThe blockbuster agreement caps what had seemed an improbable attempt by the famously mercurial Mr. Musk, 50, to buy the social media company \u2014 and immediately raises questions about what he will do with the platform and how his actions will affect online speech globally, New York Times reported.\n\nThe billionaire, who has more than 83 million followers on Twitter and has romped across the service hurling gibes and memes, has repeatedly said he wants to \u201ctransform\u201d the platform by promoting more free speech and giving users more control over what they see on it. By taking the company private, Mr. Musk could work on the service out of sight of the prying eyes of investors, regulators and others.\n\nYet scrutiny will likely be intense. Twitter is not the biggest social platform \u2014 it has more than 217 million daily users, compared with billions for Facebook and Instagram \u2014 but it has had an outsized role in shaping narratives around the world. Political leaders have used it as a megaphone, while companies, celebrities and others have employed it for image-making and brand building.\n\nIn recent years, Twitter has also become a lightning rod for controversy, as some users spread misinformation and other toxic content on the service. Former President Donald J. Trump frequently turned to Twitter to insult and inflame, before getting barred from the platform after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol last year. The company has repeatedly been forced to create policies on the fly to deal with unexpected situations.\n\nIn a statement, Bret Taylor, Twitter\u2019s chairman, said the board had \u201cconducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\u2019s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders.\u201d\n\nMr. Musk himself has had a rocky relationship with online speech. This year, he tried to quash a Twitter account that tracked the movements of his private jet, citing personal and safety reasons. On Monday, he tweeted that he hoped his worst critics would remain on Twitter because \u201cthat is what free speech means.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout any conditions for Musk to purchase Twitter, the platform\u2019s community standards and recourse to ban users who violate those standards, Twitter could set a dangerous precedent for other social media companies to follow,\u201d said Bridget Todd, director at UltraViolet, a women\u2019s rights organization. \u201cThis is a massively slippery slope.\u201d\n\nBeyond speech issues, Twitter faces questions about its business. For years, the company has struggled to gain new users and to keep people coming back to the service. Its advertising business, which is the main way Twitter makes revenue, has been inconsistent. Twitter has not turned a profit for eight of the last 10 years.\n\nHow hands-on Mr. Musk plans to be at Twitter is unclear. Among the unanswered issues are who he might pick to lead the company and how involved he would be in running the service. In addition to running Tesla and SpaceX, Mr. Musk also has other companies, such as Neuralink, which aims build a computer interface for the human brain, and the Boring Company, which makes tunnels.",

He recalled that last year alone, the Cement Company co-processed 89,000 tonnes of wastes as an alternative fuel, in the form of biomass, scrap tyres, fly ash, spent oil and greases, just to mention a few.\n\nEmphasizing that adequate measures were being taken to checkmate environmental degradation, he lamented the environmental challenges the world faces, which stem from climate change, drought, desertification, deforestation, famine, violence, improper disposal of solid and chemical waste as well pollution of various degrees.\n\nThe key message for Earth Day, according to him is to act in a bold way, innovate in a broad way, and implement climate action in an equitable manner which supports Dangote Cement\u2019s contributions to SDG 13 and aligns with the Environment pillar of the Dangote way.\n\nIn his remark, the Head, Alternative Fuel Project, Dangote Cement Plc, Mr. Peter Anagbe said this year\u2019s Earth Day offers Dangote Cement the opportunity among others to \u201cdemonstrate our contribution to sustainable waste management and the inclusion of local communities in our value chain through the Alternative Fuel (AF) Project. This is our response to the UN\u2019s call to action to promote harmony with nature and mother earth.\u201d\n\nHe listed several circular economy initiatives to be implemented such as a community stakeholder enlightenment campaign to communicate the importance of managing and reusing waste responsibly. As part of the initiative, a visit will be conducted to communities where AF material is sourced and prevented from going to landfills.\n\nAlso speaking on the occasion of the World Earth Day, the Head, Sustainability, Dr. Igazeuma Okoroba explained that Dangote Cement has done a lot to protect the mother earth through strategic actions to protection of the environment from further pollution and degradation.\n\nIt would be recalled that the United Nations 2015 established the sustainable development goals. These goals are inclusive of climate change, responsible consumption and production, sustainable cities and communities, affordable and clean energy, clean water and sanitation.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s art colossus and father of art in the country, Prof. Bruce Onobrakpeya will be participating at the maiden exhibition to raise awareness for children living with autism.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement made known to the public by Mr. Femi Coker, the manager Orisun Art Gallery Abuja.\n\nIn his statement he opined that the therapeutic potential of art will be used in encouraging and galvanizing support for these children who need special care. The exhibition is tagged \u201cThe Master and The Prodigy.\u201d\n\nThis position is aligned with the United Nations\u2019 which set aside the month of April as a month to bring to the public knowledge the challenges and plight of those that have autism and how intervention can be made.\n\nThe exhibition will be in collaboration with Mr. Tagbo-Okeke, the father of Kanye who will organize a first-of-its-kind art exhibition, to commemorate the event, bringing together in an art exhibition Prof. Bruce Onobrakpeya, a quintessential master artist and educator and the prodigious autistic teenage artist, Kanye Tagbo-Okeke, from April 29, 2022 at the gallery.\n\nAccording to Femi Coker, \u201cArt universally is known to be therapeutic, the possession of this special gift, its development and utilization, has been used over the ages, to inspire, to challenge, to galvanize people to action, to draw attention to global causes, to address social ills and to document the evolution of time.\u201d\n\nThe cultural advocate said one of the core purposes of Orisun Art Gallery, is to use art and the gallery as a platform to excite the consciousness of communities and engage their attention on the very important role of art, in addressing some fundamental issues bordering on health and well-being, which should be dear to our heart.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is one of such. And it is a serious developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact. It impacts the nervous system, leading to obsessive interests and compulsive behaviors. Treatment for this disorder can help, but unfortunately, this condition cannot be cured. Therefore, children with autism have a special need for care and attention. Some of them face discrimination and abuses because their conditions are not properly diagnosed and also because the awareness out in the public is not adequate enough.\n\nAs art is very instructive to teaching and learning, visual art particularly has a resonance that captures the attention of all the categories of people.\n\nCoker also added that the event will honor the immense contribution of Prof. Onobrakpeya to the art industry, spanning over six decades, as a special guest and to spotlight the incredible talent of Kanye Tagbo-Okeke and more importantly to create more awareness for autism.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly delighted to be working with Bruce, he is a name that is being respected in the art circles. We have built Kanye as a brand that gives hope to the children that have special needs and we are looking forward to this exhibition where Kanye\u2019s works will be exhibited for the world to see and once again make people understand the predicaments of children with autism and how best to deal with the challenge,\u201d the statement said.",

          "text": "The board of Twitter has agreed to a $44bn (\u00a334.5bn) takeover offer from the billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nMr Musk, who made the shock bid less than two weeks ago, said Twitter had \u201ctremendous potential\u201d that he would unlock.\n\nHe also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.\n\nThe firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk\u2019s bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.\n\nMr Musk is the world\u2019s richest man, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Mr Musk said in a statement announcing the deal.\n\n\u201cI also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cTwitter has tremendous potential \u2013 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\u201d\n\nThe move by Mr Musk comes as Twitter has struggled to mediate the spread of misinformation on its platform. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year, it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \u201cincitement of violence\u201d.\n\nWhile the takeover has been cheered by his followers, Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform and would instead stay on his own social network, Truth Social.\n\nBret Taylor, chair of Twitter\u2019s board, said it had full assessed Mr Musk\u2019s offer and it was \u201cthe best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders\u201d.\n\nIt is not clear who will lead the new company. The firm company is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November.\n\nBut in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter\u2019s board: \u201cI don\u2019t have confidence in management.\u201d\n\nUnder the deal, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter\u2019s shares will be delisted and it will be taken private.\n\nMr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business.\n\nMr Musk\u2019s targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that Mr Musk had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe was then invited to join Twitter\u2019s board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted to \u201cunlock\u201d its potential as a bastion of freedom of speech.\n\nTwitter responded by putting in place a so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d defence to fend off Mr Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Mr Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company.\n\nBut Twitter\u2019s stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details. He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business.\n\nThough it has transformed the news business and how celebrities and politicians reach their audiences, Twitter has long disappointed Wall Street, lagging other social media companies in its ability to convert that power into dollars.\n\nThe company ended 2021 with more than 200 million daily users globally, up 13% from the prior year, with most of that growth coming from overseas.\n\nBut earlier this year, shares were trading lower than they did when the company first listed on the stock exchange in 2013.",

          "text": "Farmers in Nigeria have commended input and market linkage interventions of the CBN, calling on the Federal Government to spread the coverage of the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) to every state of the country following good results in rice and maize production.\n\nAlthough the country is said to be deficient in the two commodities, production have increased significantly through the ABP.\n\nThe farmers lamented that seeds, fertiliser and other inputs for food crop production have become too expensive, and escalating assistance to them through the ABP scheme is not only desirable but also expedient for the country.\n\nThe umbrella body of various commodity associations in Nigeria, the All Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (AFAN), said without deepening various existing funding systems and intervention programmes of the apex bank, improved seeds, fertiliser and other agro-chemicals that would help farmers to produce adequate quantity of food would be a mirage.\n\nLinking more off-takers, financial institutions and insurers to empower more farmers with inputs and finances with pre-agreed buy-back prices should be spread to every state, the association disclosed.\n\n\u201cWithout such assistance, most farmers, due to financial constraints, would only recycle grains as seeds, avoid use of fertiliser and agro-chemicals and would do manual tillage, planting and weeding with resultant poor yields,\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently disclosed that it would finance the cultivation of 600,000 hectares of grains in the 2022 wet season farming.\n\nThe partnership between the CBN and Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) through the ABP had produced a total of 300 metric tonnes in 2021, which were displayed in 12 pyramids and released to the market through allocations to food and agro-allied stakeholders.\n\nThe governor of the bank, Godwin Emefilele, said: \u201cAs we prepare for another wet season programme, the Central Bank of Nigeria is committed to financing over 600,000 hectares. Our strategy is hinged on improving productivity by providing more funding for the anchors to enable them to utilise high quality inputs and good agronomic practices to boost output.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank has spent N864 billion on 4.1 million farmers cultivating 5.02 million hectares through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) so far. The farmers include grain, cereal, cassava, cocoa, yam and sweet potato farmers, among others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the Rice Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) rice pyramids in Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari said the ABP had supported over 4.8 million small-scale farmers with planting inputs and market linkages that have boosted their means of livelihood and food production, saying, \u201cThe ABP has so far supported over 4.8 million smallholder farmers across Nigeria for the production of 23 agricultural commodities, including maize, rice, oil palm, cocoa, cotton, cassava, tomato, and livestock. Today, rice production in Nigeria has increased to over 7.5 million metric tonnes annually.\u201d\n\nNigeria produces about 12.0 million tonnes of maize, while yearly demand hovers around 20.0 million metric tonnes, fueling hike in price, and productivity of farmers has remained as low as 1.5 to 2.5 metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nA maize breeder at the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training, Prof. Samuel Olakojo, said improved seeds and new production technologies would boost productivity of farmers and ensure closing the production gap.\n\nHe also emphasised higher plant population per hectare to reduce empty spaces and weeding cost while boosting yield.\n\nHe added that in the face of financial constraints of smallholder farmers in the country, and unwillingness of financial institutions to advance loans to farmers individually, the ABP scheme of the Federal Government should be made more elaborate and all-encompassing so that more maize and other grain farmers could participate.",

          "text": "Members of a faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, have switched support by according recognition to the leadership of Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu as the state chairman of the party, just as they donated money for the day-to-day running of APC.\n\nThe party stalwarts include members of the National Assembly \u2013 House of Representatives spokesman, Hon. Ben Kalu and Hon. Sam Onuigbo representing Bende, and Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constituencies of Abia State respectively \u2013 as well a two-time governorship aspirant in the state, Chief Henry Ikoh.\n\nOthers include members of the State House of Assembly, Chijioke Chukwu and Mike Ukoha of Bende South and Arochukwu state constituencies respectively, and a former legislator, Dr. Blessing Nwagba, formerly of Aba Central state constitency.\n\nBefore now, the party chieftains and their supporters belonged to a faction of APC led a former House of Representatives member, who represented Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constitency from 1999-2003, Hon. Acho Obioma.\n\nObioma emerged state party chairman at a parallel state congress conducted by a former member of the State House of Assembly on the platform of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), Hon. Donatus Nwankpa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA reliable source hinted LEADERSHIP exclusively that in no distant time, \u201cthe Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, and Minister of State for Solid Minerals and Steel Development, Dr. Uche Ogah, will join the trail.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at a fundraising event organised by the party in the state capital, Umuahia, the party stalwarts formerly loyal to Obioma along with other party members, stakeholders, and supporters, pledged to cooperate with each other to ensure electoral victory for APC in 2023 under the chairmanship of Ononogbu.\n\nThey decried the poor state of infrastructure and social services across the state, and the trauma both civil servants and pensioners were going through due to irregular payment of salaries and pension and the stoppage of gratuity payment.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, leader of the party in the state, Chief Ikechi Emenike, said the APC was the only consistent and reliable party with vision, adding that the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has become ineffective.\n\nAccording to him, the other parties had long ago become subsidiaries of the ruling party, adding that coming in on a rescue mission, the APC and other concerned stakeholders were focussed on changing the narrative in 2023.\n\nAssuring that victory had began to knock on the door of the party, he insisted that much were still required to be done such as door-to-door mobilisation for voters registration, membership drive, and personal sacrifices.\n\nSimilarly, House of Representatives deputy chief whip, Hon. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, said the time to sit on the fence on issues concerning the state had gone, urging APC members to take the message to every nook and cranny of the state.\n\nOnyejeocha, who represents Umunneochi/Isuikwuato federal constitency, said people from both within and outside the country have been asking the leadership of party what it has been doing about the ugly situation in the state.\n\nEarlier, in his address of welcome, the Abia State APC chairman, Ononogbu said: \u201cThis great party belongs to all of us, and all our collective inputs are highly needed and if not jointly done, we will be operating without a clear direction.\u201d\n\nOthers present at the occasion were the national welfare officer of the party, Sir F. N. Nwosu, Lt-Gen Azubuike Ihejirika, represented by Navy Commodore Ochiabuto Igbokwe and Major-Gen Charles Okoro all retired, and Mr. Theo Ubani.\n\nThe rest were both retired Maj-Generels Abraham Chinedu and Jackson Nwogbo, Profs Obisike Ibegbulam, Victor Ukogo, Okezie Abaraikwu Drs Bob Uwaga, Orji O.

The talks are fluid and the deal could still fall apart, the sources added.\n\nTwitter\u2019s stock soared more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday as a result of the Reuters report.\n\nThe report also says that Twitter was unable to obtain a so-called \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision from Musk, which would have allowed it to solicit additional bids from potential buyers after the deal was signed.\n\nDespite this, Twitter would be able to accept an offer from another party if it paid Musk a break-up fee, according to the sources.\n\nMusk reportedly met with several shareholders over the weekend to discuss the details of his $54.20 per share bid for the social media platform. According to the report, Musk\u2019s outreach forced the Tesla CEO\u2019s $43 billion takeover bid to be seriously considered by the board of directors.\n\nMany Twitter shareholders contacted the company over the weekend after Musk outlined a detailed financing plan for his bid on Thursday, urging it not to let the opportunity for a deal pass them by.\n\nTwitter\u2019s board is concerned that defying its investors in the event Musk makes an attractive tender offer will weaken the company\u2019s negotiating position. According to the sources, Musk\u2019s insistence that his bid for Twitter is his \u201cbest and final\u201d has become a stumbling block in the deal negotiations.\n\nTwitter\u2019s board of directors is in talks with Musk to learn more about his bid and see if there is room to negotiate more favorable terms for the company.\n\nMusk has mentioned some possible Twitter reforms in recent weeks, including loosening content restrictions (which were used to suspend former President Donald Trump\u2019s account) and the need to ban fake or automated accounts.\n\nMusk is the world\u2019s wealthiest person, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of 279,000 million dollars. However, much of his fortune is invested in Tesla stock, of which he owns 17 percent, according to FactSet, as well as SpaceX, his space travel company.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite has said that the cost of road construction in the country would ultimately go down with the local production of bitumen.\n\nAdegbite made this statement in Abuja during a press briefing on the concession of the delineated Nigerian bitumen blocks, as the nation commenced the process of local bitumen production.\n\nHe also observed that local bitumen production would save the country foreign exchange and generate income for the government.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the country\u2019s bitumen deposits was ranked sixth in the world in terms of reserve size.\n\nHe further said that the nation was endowed with a bitumen reserve size of 42.74 billion metric tonnes, which had remained unexploited for years.\n\nHe said that the country was now poised to begin the production of bitumen locally as it had appointed a transaction advisor to oversee the process.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo ensure that Nigeria\u2019s bitumen resources are fully harnessed for industrial and infrastructural development, I constituted a nine-member Ministerial Bitumen Development Committee on 31 January 2020. The Committee carried out an inventory of internal existing infrastructure; compiled available geological information; re-established contact with previous interested companies and developed a framework for transparent allocation of the Bitumen resources.\n\n\u201cAn important part of the Committee\u2019s recommendations was to finalize the process of engaging a Transaction Advisor to ensure the concession process is open, transparent and in accordance with global best practices as enshrined in the Nigerian Mineral and Mining Act, 2007. The Bureau of Public Procurement, issued a notification of no-objection on 16th June, 2021.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development issued a letter of award on 11th November, 2021 to PricewaterhouseCoopers to act as its Transaction Advisor and Program Manager for the concessioning of bitumen blocks to potential investors.\u201d\n\nThe Mines minister also revealed that many international and local investors had expressed interest in bidding for the bitumen blocks.\n\nAdegbite revealed that the country was endowed with high grade bitumen which was easy to mine due to its proximity to the surface.\n\n\u201cMy office has been bombarded by several interested party both locally and internationally and I have always told them to wait for when the process is opened for bidding, which would be transparent and in accordance with best international practices. There is so much interest in our bitumen because the mineral is of the highest grade and close to the surface which makes mining less expensive,\u201d Adegbite explained.\n\nThe minister also assured prospective investors of the huge local demand for the mineral noting that \u201cNigeria\u2019s population is projected to reach 400 million in 2050, up from the present estimate of 203 million, given the present population growth rate of 2.5 percent. The World Bank projects that Nigeria\u2019s current urbanization rate of 52% will increase by 4% annually. Furthermore, 90 percent of goods, such as food and building materials, are transported by road to meet the demands of this rising population. This will increase demand for road infrastructure and put additional strain on the current road network, resulting in higher demand for asphalt for construction and maintenance. Bitumen is a crucial component of asphalt that is used in road construction and once we begin to produce bitumen locally we will have a stable price that does not fluctuate with the exchange rate.\u201d\n\nThe minister further revealed that the nation had a huge infrastructural deficit with regard to paved road.\n\nHe disclosed that only about 60,000 km out of 200,000 km of road networks was paved, which presented an inherent demand for bitumen.\n\n\u201cThis considerable road infrastructure deficit presents an inherent demand for bitumen. Hence, the development of Bitumen will lead to import substitution, local content development and increased value addition of the mining industry to the domestic economy, thereby creating jobs and generating revenue for government,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso the Minister of State Dr Uche Ogah, while giving his remarks noted that the ministry\u2019s plan to develop bitumen was in fulfillment of the mandate given it by Mr. president, to diversify the economy away from oil.",

He also affirmed that Blockchain would be central in the implementation of the National e-Govt Masterplan.\n\nThe BPSR Chief Executive equally listed the introduction of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), the Bank Verification Number (BVN), automation of enforcement activities of some agencies of the government, including the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), as well as automated performance measurement systems for public sector employees, as concrete examples of the utilisation of technology in the public sector.\n\nArabi asserted that Nigeria ranks third in Africa, in the use of telecommunications for public service delivery, coming behind South Africa and Egypt.

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim Lagos\n\nTHE governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele has said, the apex bank is expecting that the foreign exchange needed for the importation of petroleum products will decline by the end of this year when the Dangote Refinery commences operation.\n\nEmefiele, speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing World Bank/ International Monetary Fund 2022 Spring Meetings in Washington DC said the country is working on merging its exchange rate on the various markets.\n\nThis was in reaction to the president of the World Bank, David Malpass, who had mentioned on Wednesday, at a press conference that, the multiple exchange rates in the country is not encouraging to investors and also not an effective way of managing the country\u2019s exchange rate.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the CBN is working on a home grown solution at merging the exchange rates even as he said there is need to first merge the level of demand with that of supply. \u201cWhat we do expect is that to develop a home grown solution that will lessen the situation.\n\n\u201cNigeria is on a managed float and what that also means is that we cannot adopt what is being proposed that we go on a free float, doing that will create an exchange rate spiral for Nigeria as long as the demand surpass the supply of foreign exchange in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith the Dangote Refinery coming up with the 650,000 barrels per day hopefully by around the end of the year. That will also start to also reduce the demand for foreign exchange that will normally will go for importation of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cI have often said between the importations of refined products alone, importation or whether it is rice or sugar or wheat, consumes close to about 40 per cent of foreign currency that is needed to fund imports in Nigeria. And if we find for instance, a situation were by around the end of this year, we\u2019re able to begin to see we are no longer going to be needing foreign import petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWe have been at this since 1986 and that is why we are saying that whereas, we are doing something to adjust the currency like for instance between 2015 and now, you would observe that we have adjusted the currency from about N155 to about N420 that it is today.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot be accused of not adjusting the currency that we are trying to adopt a very gradual approach towards adjusting the price to the level that it is today but at the same time. We have to be given a chance to also look at while we are adjusting price, we must also do something about demand and supply.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason we are saying that we need to do something on demand to make sure that those things that we can produce in the country we restrict access to foreign exchange for them so, that that will encourage people to produce locally. When that happens. What it will mean is that the demand for foreign exchange will reduce and when demand for it reduces ultimately you will find that price will not rise beyond the expectation of Nigerians and we are achieving that.\n\n\u201cToday, we have done a lot in intervention in agriculture. Is it your rice, we have stopped the import of rice. We have stopped import of maize. Right now no foreign exchange for importation of rice or maize, very little amount for wheat.\n\n\u201cI believe that demand will drop as demand drops, what you will find is that whatever supply we have is able to merge with demand and then we can see a stable exchange. That is what we\u2019re trying to do and I imagine that by the time we achieved this, we will continue to engage with World Bank or the IMF,\u201d he pointed out.",

We will keep offering user-friendly products that offer our customers convenience, and benefit their overall health and productivity.\n\n\u201cAt LG, we aim to create convenient solutions to meet the needs of everyone in the home. We want to help create happy family moments this Ramadan, and we are wholly invested in identifying the daily moments where families need our technology the most. Our appliances are designed to be smart, safe, convenient and time-saving, so everyone can enjoy more quality time at home\u201d, he stated.\n\nThe company said in a statement that global food waste is a massive issue with huge financial, ethical, and environmental costs. An estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted globally each year, one third of all food produced for human consumption, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.\n\n\u2018\u2018In Sub-Saharan Africa, post-harvest food losses are estimated to be worth USD 4 billion per year \u2013 or enough to feed at least 48 million people, according to the UN Environment Programme. The amount of food lost or wasted costs 2.6 trillion USD each year and is more than enough to feed the world\u2019s 815 million hungry people four times over.\n\n\u2018\u2018During the month of Ramadan, trends have also shown that people tend to buy more food items than their normal requirements for self-consumption and hosting of guests. Due to the limited quantity of food to be consumed by people this additional quantity of cooked or made food becomes waste as Iftar is not usually eaten as night snacks or as Suhoor the next day. The demand for fresh food increases as majority of people are willing to spend an extra amount for the better quality of food.\n\nOne global brand that have continuously rethink how food wastage can be better managed is home appliance leader, LG Electronics. LG\u2019s never-ending quest to innovate its refrigerators and other home appliances has also led to the development of other technologies designed to create more efficient experiences,\u2019\u2019 the company said in a statement.",

          "text": "Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, struck a deal Monday to buy Twitter for $44 billion, capping a saga complete with hostile takeover threats before delivering him personal control of one of the most influential social media platforms on the planet.\n\nTwitter famously served as a megaphone for former US president Donald Trump before the platform banned him, and Musk \u2014 a self-proclaimed \u201cfree-speech absolutist\u201d \u2014 has said he wants to reform what he sees as the platform\u2019s over-zealous content moderation.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in a statement released by Twitter.\n\n\u201cI also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Google\u2019s Subsea Cable Arrives In Nigeria, To Improve Internet Speed\n\nThe publicly traded firm will now become a private company owned by Musk, who negotiated a purchase price of $54.20 per-share, Twitter said.\n\n\u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important,\u201d the company\u2019s CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet.\n\nMusk last week lined up around $46.5 billion in financing to make the purchase happen, and Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, predicted earlier in the day that since the board could not find another buyer, it would likely accept his offer.\n\n\u201cThis basically put (their) back against the wall, they had to come to the negotiation table,\u201d he said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nOn Wall Street, Twitter stock was trading 5.9 percent higher around 1915 GMT.\n\nTrump to return?\n\nMusk, who has complained of overzealous moderation on the platform, bought a nine-percent stake in Twitter earlier in April, then offered to buy the whole company outright, citing a mission of preserving free speech.\n\nWhile the firm\u2019s board initially said it was reviewing his offer, it later rebuffed him and adopted a \u201cpoison pill\u201d plan that would have made it harder for Musk to acquire a controlling position.\n\nLast week, Musk \u2014 whose immense wealth stems from the popularity of Tesla electric vehicles as well as other ventures \u2014 said he had lined up financing.\n\nDespite Musk\u2019s wealth, the question of financing had been seen as a potential stumbling block because much of his holdings are in Tesla shares rather than cash.\n\nIn a filing, Musk had pointed to a $13 billion debt facility from a financing consortium led by Morgan Stanley, a separate $12.5 billion margin loan from the same bank, as well as $21 billion from his personal fortune as being behind the deal.\n\nMusk\u2019s efforts have raised hopes about the commercial potential of Twitter, which has struggled to achieve profitable growth despite its influential spot in culture and politics.\n\nUnder Agrawal, who took over as Twitter CEO late last year, the company has made progress on new monetization features, such as subscription products, Truist securities said in a note, adding that \u201cshort term, Musk\u2019s involvement at this stage runs the risk of disrupting those efforts.\u201d\n\nBut the polarizing Tesla chief\u2019s campaign has also sparked concern among technology and free-speech experts who point to Musk\u2019s unpredictable statements and history of bullying critics, which contradict his stated aims.\n\nProgressive group Media Matters for America warned that Trump, who was banned from Twitter after last year\u2019s assault on the US Capitol by his supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, could return if Musk\u2019s purchase goes through.\n\n\u201cAny negotiations to sell Twitter to Musk must include clear enforceable mechanisms to uphold and maintain existing community standards, including the removal of those who violate those standards,\u201d the group\u2019s president Angelo Carusone said in a statement.\n\nAFP",

The price of a carton of tramadol was negotiated at N17 million each as against the then black market value that ranged between N18 million and N20 million a carton in Lagos.\n\nHe said after the arrest of Ukatu\u2019s staff: Pius Enidom and Sunday Ibekwete, Kyari\u2019s men were then led by the suspects to Mallinson\u2019s warehouse at Ojota in Lagos where 197 additional cartons of tramadol 225mg were seized by the IRT Team. The monetary value of the 202 cartons of the seized products from Mallinson in one day was over N3 billion.\n\nHe alleged that three weeks after the seizure, the Kyari\u2019s IRT team transferred only 12 Cartons of the tramadol with one truck and a suspect to the Lagos Command of the NDLEA, leaving 190 cartons unaccounted for, and after over eight months of following the lead, anti-narcotics officers of the agency eventually arrested Ukatu at the Lagos airport on 13th April 2022.\n\nBabafemi recalled that Kyari and four top members of his team are already facing trial for a different but similar offence at a Federal High Court in Abuja.",

This led Twitter\u2019s board to take the deal more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal to slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nThe sale would represent an admission by Twitter that its new chief executive Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, is not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter\u2019s shares were trading higher than Musk\u2019s offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk\u2019s negotiating tactics \u2013 making one offer and sticking with it \u2013 resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions.
