          "text": "Our escape from Boko Haram captivity after eight years as insurgents\u2019 wives, by Chibok schoolgirls\n\nWith grim determination, two Chibok schoolgirls escaped from the Sambisa Forest camp of their Boko Haram captors after eight years as wives of top commanders of the deadly terrorists.\n\nAfter their abduction from the dormitory of the Government Girls Secondary School (GGSS), in Chibok, Borno State along with 276 others on April 14, 2014, Mary Dauda and Hauwa Joseph were married off to members of the deadly sect.\n\nYesterday in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, they recounted their ordeal in the camp, and how they fled, risking their lives, and landed in the hands of troops, who rescued them.\n\nAfter their abduction, the schoolgirls were shared out into camps where they became spouses of terrorists.\n\nMary, who was abducted at 18, is now 26 and mother of one. Hauwa is now 24.\n\nThe two ladies said more than 20 of their schoolmates are still in Gazuwa camp in Sambisa Forest.\n\nGazuwa camp is the acclaimed headquarters of the Boko Haram faction, formerly known as Gabchari, Mantari and Mallum Masari, located about nine kilometres to Bama Local Government Area of Borno.\n\nInteracting with reporters at the Command and Control Centre, Maimalari Cantonment, in Maiduguri, Marry, said she could still vividly recall her compulsory marriage eight years ago.\n\nShe narrated how she walked through the deadly forest for many days before she found help.\n\nLike the others conscripted by the militants, she had been told that she would be hunted down and killed if she deserted.\n\nAccording to a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report, Mary said: \u201cI took excuse from Malam Ahmed, that I will be visiting my relative from Chibok in Ngoshe town and he allowed me to go for one week. That was when I began my journey for freedom.\n\n\u201cI left Sabil Huda, popularly known as the camp of Abubakar Shekau and preceded towards Njimiya and Parisu, where I met some of the Mujahedeens. They asked where I was going and I told them I was given permission to visit my sister in Ngoshe.\n\n\u201cI finally arrived at Gava Village in Gwoza, after walking for many hours through the deadly forest under hardship and poor condition. I asked some people to direct me to the home of \u2018Ddaughter of Chibok\u2019.\n\n\u201dAfter meeting her, I told her of my plans to return home, she told me she had wanted to come with me but her husband had placed her under strict surveillance for attempting to run away in the past. I then left her and proceeded toward Ngoshe town.\n\n\u201dOn my way, I met an old man who promised to help me to escape. But he told me that it won\u2019t be possible in the afternoon until the sun had set. At about 8pm, he took me to Ngoshe and told me to pass the night in the outskirt of the town and I proceed in the next morning.\n\n\u201cWhen the day broke, I took myself to some soldiers where I was rescued with my baby.\u201d\n\nGiving her own account, Hauwa said she was forcibly married to Amir Abbah, Commander of Boko Haram (Munzul), at Gazuwa camp who was later killed during an encounter with the troops of the Nigerian Army.\n\nShe said she voluntarily escaped from the camp of the terrorists during a massive incursion by the troops of the Nigerian army into their camp in Gazuwa on June 12.\n\nHauwa said as people were running in the same direction where the sect members were hiding women and children, she took a separate route to escape from the terrorists camp.\n\nShe recounted how she tricked some of the insurgents who met her on the way and sought to know where she was going.\n\nAccording to her, she told them she was following some women to hide in the nearby forest.\n\nShe said: \u201cI slept under the tree with my child. I then proceeded the next day until I arrived at the road where I approached a military check point. Initially, they thought I was a suicide bomber, but when I explained myself, they took me along with them.\u201d\n\nShe thanked the military for rescuing her, saying she hoped other girls still in the camps of the terrorists would be rescued.\n\nThe Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai (Northeast Joint Operation) Maj.-Gen. Christopher Musa, confirmed that the girls were among the list of the missing Chibok schoolgirls.\n\nGen. Musa said that they were rescued due to a massive military operation in Sambisa Forest, Mandara Mountain, and the Lake Chad area.\n\n\u201dWe are putting more efforts to ensure that the rest of the girls are rescued through the ongiong Operation Lake and Desert Sanity,\u201d the Theatre Commander said.\n\nMaj.-Gen. Waidi Shuaibu, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division of the Army, said the girls were rescued between June 12 and 14, around Bama and Gwoza general area.\n\nGen. Shuaibu said the girls had received necessary medical attention and would soon be handed over to the appropriate authorities.",

So is the APC.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about what is happening in other parties, my focus is on the APC.\n\n\u201cBut we all know that the occurrence is not only happening in the APC; it\u2019s happening across other political parties too. And because we are the ruling party, our problems are exaggerated before the public.\n\n\u201cThere is no responsible leader that would not be worried when he loses one member not to talk of two. At the moment we are faced with the stark reality of our problems.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I at the National Working Committee of the APC are committed to facing the problem squarely. We see the problem as solvable.\n\n\u201cWe are in politics. I don\u2019t know what would happen tomorrow, and nobody does.\u201d\n\nOn how to stem injustice against the defectors, Adamu said: \u201cYou have no guarantee. We are in politics for God\u2019s sake.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow. How can I foresee tomorrow? I am not the person who saw tomorrow.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2018Supply hiccups behind scarcity\n\n\u2018Nigerians must stop panic buying\u2019\n\nThere is reprieve for petrol users who have been reeling under scarcity of product and payment of higher cost.\n\nYesterday\u2019s decision of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) to revert its position on the sale of petrol from N180 per litre to the recommended N165 per litre has raised the hope of an end to product shortage.\n\nIPMAN National President, Chinedu Okoronkwo, at a briefing in Abuja yesterday, said the association had resolved to maintain the status quo ante.\n\nHe said the NNPC and the Pipeline and Product Marketing Company (PPMC) responded positively to the association\u2019s request by releasing products from their tank farms that can last 32 days.\n\nOkoronkwo urged Nigerians to stop panic buying petrol.\n\nOn the directive from the Lagos branch, he said: \u201cThe cost of doing business has changed.\n\n\u201cMy members in Lagos, before they did what they did, called and told me that they are getting the product at N162 to N165 per litre with transportation aggregating to about N170 to N173.\n\n\u201cEven the N10 which is supposed to be ours has been eroded. What do we do?\n\n\u201cIt is only NNPC that imports this product. Don\u2019t blame some of these tank farm owners because the cost of doing business has changed.\n\n\u201cIt became so difficult for them to sell at N148.17 but the NNPC and PPMC went to their tank farms and released products. We can now access the product at N148.17.\n\n\u201cStatus quo ante must be maintained moving forward. They have told us they have products that can last us up to 32 days.\n\n\u201cWe must be happy with that, knowing full well the challenges we have globally on energy. That is why we are thanking them.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the loading of the product is ongoing in Lagos. He is hopeful that in a matter of days the queues will disappear.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for making available a N4trillion budgetary provision for subsidy, especially with the current global energy problems caused by the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nHe said the association has engaged a consultant to determine how much bridging claims are owed the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP).\n\nChairman of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Olumide Adeosun, said the scarcity was the culmination of a declining supply by the NNPC.\n\nHe said at a virtual briefing that supply has been on the decline since May.\n\nHe said fuel supply was 438,800MT in April; 213,000MT in May and 140,000MT in June, with 64,000MT being loaded as of Tuesday.\n\nThis supply inadequacy, Adeosun noted, combined with the distribution challenges created by the unavailability and continuous surge in international prices of Automotive Gas Oil (Diesel) compounded the situation.\n\nThe association fears that the current supply framework cannot guarantee steady supplies given the current state of government finances and unpredictable international supply shortages.\n\nMOMAN said the full deregulation of the petroleum downstream sector and full implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 remains the most viable long-term solution to the country\u2019s fuel supply and distribution challenges.\n\nIt recommended gradual price deregulation with targeted palliatives like transport and agricultural subsidies.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN), Mr Femi Adewole, said the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war impacted negatively on global and local fuel and food supply, with international prices rising.\n\nAccording to him, the local running costs of operating various fuel depots have gone up astronomically as a result.\n\nDepot operators, he said, purchase the products with funds sourced with high bank interest charges, alongside increased costs of hiring vessels with which fuel cargoes are brought to the depots.\n\n\u201cThese costs have doubled within the period of this Russian/Ukraine war. Added to this is the scarcity of bunkers (ship\u2019s fuel).\n\n\u201cWe also experienced astronomical increases in the cost of diesel used to power equipment and machinery in our various depots and our retail outlets,\u201d Adewole said.\n\nHe added that depot owners and the government had continued to struggle over time to supply at N165 per litre despite subsidy.\n\nThe Lagos chapter of IPMAN, through its secretary Akeem Balogun, on Monday announced it would no longer be able to sell petrol below N180.\n\nThe marketers claimed the current pump price was unsustainable due to high operational costs.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) on Wednesday maintained that the pump price remained unchanged.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it had over two billion litres of PMS that would last for at least a month \u2013 enough stock to meet demand.",

          "text": "Pan-Igbo socio-political group Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday gave reasons the United States and the United Kingdom may not proscribe the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe group\u2019s agitation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said, is anchored on the marginalisation of the Southeast.\n\nIt sighted lopsided appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari as an example of such marginalisation.\n\nPresident Buhari, in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, pleaded with Western partners to block IPOB from the international financial network.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,\u201d Bloomberg quoted the President as saying.\n\nBut, Ohanaeze said the President had fueled a sense of injustice by the continuous exclusion of the Southeast in the scheme of things.\n\nIn a statement by its spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia, said even the West are not blind to the causes of IPOB\u2019s agitations.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe request by Mr. President to the West is most unachievable because the West watches with keen interest and utter resignation the pathetic governance paradigm in the country.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, democracy all over the world requires justice, equity, mutual toleration and institutional forbearance all of which are in short supply in today\u2019s Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr. President is reminded that the British profound sense of justice, fortitude, restraint, civic virtues and forbearance are the hallmarks that sustain their enviable government with an unwritten constitution.\n\n\u201cIn a similar vein, what sustains the U.S. democracy is not just the constitution but democratic norms and values anchored on justice and patriotism.\u201d\n\nThe group believes what IPOB is asking for is to be treated \u201cas partners in the Nigerian project or be allowed to go.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, how can one explain the obvious lopsidedness in the appointment of military and paramilitary personnel to head the followings organisations with little or no Southeast considerations: Army, Airforce, Navy, Police, Department of State Security (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Correctional Service, Immigration Service, Customs Service and several others.\n\n\u201cMr. President knows he ignored the eternal advice from the Nigerian foremost patriot, democrat and diplomat, Alhaji Maitama Sule.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Sule of the blessed memory in congratulating Mr. President, admonished that \u2018justice is key to good governance\u2019, that Mr. President should extend justice to all and sundry, irrespective of religion or tribe.\n\n\u201cSule reminded Mr. President that an infidel with good conscience and equity can govern successfully, far better than a believer devoid of a sense of justice.\n\n\u201dSule added that the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems can never be achieved by force, nor by fear, nor by power but by equity and justice to all.\n\n\u201cThe prophetic Sule urged him to do justice to all parts of the country because according to him, peace and stability are a product of justice and equity.\n\n\u201cHe added that in the absence of justice and equity, there can never be peace and development.\n\n\u201cSule, among others, stated that in absence of development, there will be mass unemployment and poverty and that the idle mind is a devil\u2019s workshop.\n\n\u201cAs Sule predicted, the orchestrated alienation of the Southeast from the centres of power is the basic cause of the agitation in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide led by Ambassador Professor George Obiozor has repeatedly stated that a people denied justice may not have interest in peace.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze said the President has also not decisively dealt with the issue of herdsmen, who it noted killed many in Benue days ago.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze contends that if Mr President confronts the menace of the herdsmen who have been terrorising several states, communities and individuals for over seven years now with similar obsession and commitment deployed to IPOB, Nigeria will be a better place,\u201d it added.\n\nIPOB denies involvement in pipeline vandalism\n\nAlso yesterday, IPOB denied the allegation that it is involved in pipeline vandalism in the Niger Delta.\n\nPresident Buhari had, in the interview with Bloomberg, attributed Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its OPEC quota in crude production to the criminal activities of the secessionist group in the oil-producing region.\n\n\u201cIt would help if our western allies designated IPOB as a terrorist group given their complicity in damage to pipelines and infrastructure,\u201d the President said.\n\nBut in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB claimed the Federal Government and western audience knew about the pipeline vandals.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cMuhammadu Buhari should tell America and other western countries the locations of pipelines IPOB vandalised.\n\n\u201cThe allegation against IPOB is childish because everybody knows that IPOB does not engage in pipeline vandalism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEven the international community knows that IPOB does not involve in such activities.\n\n\u201cMaybe the Federal Government doesn\u2019t know that the West is not daft and uninformed, perhaps he would not have made such embarrassing claims.\n\n\u201cBuhari should be reminded that his Western audience already knows the actual culprits behind pipeline vandalism in Nigeria, and who the beneficiaries are.\n\n\u201cIn case he has forgotten, as usual, just last week, his Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) boss threatened to name high-profile Nigerians behind oil theft.\n\n\u201cDid the NSCDC boss need to issue such a threat assuming IPOB, a \u2018terror organisation\u2019 according to Buhari\u2019s Nigeria, is actually the ones behind the crime?\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain: IPOB will hunt down those terrorists masquerading as herdsmen in Biafran bushes and forests.\n\n\u201cWhatever allegations they like let them fabricate; we can\u2019t abdicate our divine mandate of defending our ancestral land against occupation.\u201d",

          "title": "CVR: INEC bows to pressure, extends exercise by 60 days",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Sola Ojo, Kaduna, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nIndications emerged, yesterday, that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have bowed to pressure and considered the request for extension of ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise.\n\nChairman, House of Representatives Committee on Electoral Matters, Aisha Dukku, disclosed this, yesterday, while briefing journalists on the outcome of a meeting between the committee and the electoral body.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nDukku said following the resolution of the House requesting extension of the CVR by 60 days, the committee met with INEC on Tuesday to brainstorm on challenges encountered by Nigerians seeking to register and vote in next year\u2019s polls.\n\nShe said after the meeting, the electoral body promised to look at the resolution and come up with a position.\n\nThe lawmaker, however, said the extension, according to INEC, might not last up to 60 days.\n\nMinority leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu, expressed concerns over the flouting of House resolutions by government agencies. He said there were indications that INEC was not willing to comply with the resolution of the House.\n\n\u201cWe passed a resolution on INEC by way of consideration to extend the tenure of continuous voter\u2019s registration, which they had wanted to stop. And I\u2019m also aware that the court of competent jurisdiction also gave a judgment to the effect urging INEC not to stop or end the continuous registration. But from feelers that I am getting, it\u2019s like INEC is even threatening to appeal against that judgement, jettisoning the resolution that was passed on this floor.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Speaker, I will like the chairman of the House Committee on Electoral Matters to educate us on the efforts that they have made. The second leg of the motion is for them to follow up and ensure compliance, that is the point of my order,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\nContacted last night, INEC denied extending the June 30 deadline.\n\nA message by Rotimi Oyekanmi, Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said: \u201cThe commission has not announced any extension of the CVR deadline.\u201d\n\n\u2022SERAP hails, NGOs seek more time\n\nNotwithstanding, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has hailed the extension but noted \u201cit still falls short of statutory requirements and international standards. We\u2019ll see INEC in court next week to make our case for INEC to fully comply with the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the leadership of the Unified Nigerian Youth Forum (UNYF) said the 60-day extension would not be enough to capture more prospective voters.\n\nIt said about seven million young Nigerians who would be clocking 18 years just a few days after the expiration of the new deadline in August 29 would be disenfranchised from voting.\n\nThe group in a statement by its President, Abdulsalam Kazeem, appealed to the commission to expand the voter registration and validation infrastructure to capture young Nigerians who are patriotic and willing to exercise their civic responsibility come 2023.\n\n\u201cGoing by INEC\u2019s new proposal the registration will stop by August ending which means that many eligible Nigerians will be deliberately disenfranchised and our members included. It looks outdated for INEC to propose closing her portal five months before the general elections in this technologically driven century\u2026\n\n\u201cWe as a Forum sincerely hope that INEC would reconsider extending the voters registration exercise to cover significant numbers of those who are willing but unable to get their PVC to date due to queues, corrupt process, inadequate registration centres, favouritism and late report to duty post by most INEC officials saddled with the tasks.\u201d\n\nThe Leadership and Entrepreneurship Advocacy (LEAD) Network Africa canvassed for December deadline. It reminded INEC of its founding mandate, which states:\u201cOn no account should anyone who presents himself to be registered be denied.\u201d It said until people are scarce in every registration centre, the process should not end.\n\n\u201cBut in this case, there are thousands of Nigerians hoping to get their PVC on a daily basis. So I will suggest that the process should continue until two months to the elections, so that millions of Nigerian will not be disenfranchised,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022INEC registers 8m additional potential voters\n\nMeanwhile, INEC said it registered 8,057,167 potential voters between June 28, 2021 and June 20, 2022.\n\nMrs Tonia Nwobi, spokesperson in Cross River said the figure covered physical and online registrants.\n\nShe said 4,862,849 were physical registrants, while 3,194,318 persons had registered online before the mode was suspended on May 31.\n\nShe also said 222,072 of the registrants were recorded in Cross River. She gave the five states with the highest figures of registrants as Delta, 378,129; Osun, 372,609; Bayelsa, 370,264; Rivers, 358,725 and Lagos with 338,955.\n\nShe said states with the least number of registrants are Imo with 79,285; FCT, 88,823; Yobe, 90,398; Enugu, 108,397, and Ekiti, 124,844 registrants.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, has approved the digitisation of the services of the National Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) to be known as e-NSITF.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige disclosed this to State House Correspondents saying the digitisation of NSITF was in line with the government\u2019s policy on ease of doing business. He said the policy would curtail losses in the system.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\n\u201cThe ministry presented two memos to the council today. The first memo was presented on behalf of our parastatal, the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). As you\u2019re aware, a lot has happened in the NSITF in terms of revenue loses and plunder of funds that have been given to that organisation.\n\n\u201cThe NSITF implements the Employee Compensation Act ECA 2010 and by that Act, Employers in both public and private sectors are supposed to pay one percent of the emoluments of their staff into a social fund in NSITF. And this one is to be used as a premium or insurance fund to cater for workers or staff members who have accidents, injuries, disabilities and even deaths that occur in the cause of their work.\n\n\u201cThe pension Act makes reference to it that it must be done for workers in addition to group life. So, the monies that have gone in there have not been properly utilised, the payments have not been tracked. So, today we brought to council a memo for an e-NSITF by which their operations will now be digitalised. Both the payments that are put in from any of their stations, they have 56 branches and 11 regional offices. So in the comfort of your office, you can pay and register on that platform and that money is now tracked into a Central pool, form where claims are made and payments are also made for the insurance of those who are beneficiaries, you also track them.\u201d\n\nNgige said the new strategy would enhance the efficiency of NSITF as well as block leakages.\n\nFEC also approved the enactment of the Federal Produce Inspection Service Bill 2022, for onward transmission to the National Assembly for passage.\n\nNgige said the council also approved an upgrade of a portal called Nigerian Labour Exchange (NILEX), to withstand requests by both employers and employees within and outside the country.\n\n\u201cThat digital platform is supposed to be used by employers on one hand and job seekers on the other. The employers will load the vacancies they have, the type of skill they want, the qualifications of people that can fit in there. Then the job seekers, graduates and non-graduates will register, put in the qualification and skill and then the two groups are matched. The employer can speak with a job seeker, via that platform.\n\n\u201cOver the years we have not been able to expand it. But on a bilateral, multilateral agreement now the funds have been provided. So we are redesigning it, remodelling it, and then upgrading the infrastructure.\n\n\u201cCouncil approved that consultant should also handle that with a completion period of 12 weeks. With that we have passed the first stage of digitalising that particular platform. And one of the good things about that platform now is that when it becomes operational, all those phoney platforms that ask people to register for work, pay in N1000 or N20,000, will become a thing of the past because this will be a government platform. And when you go there, you know is a genuine platform.\n\n\u201cApart that, people in diaspora can also upload their expertise and tell Nigerians, what they have that qualify them for special jobs and if they are employers in Nigeria that need them, again they\u2019ll be handshake through that same portal.\u201d\n\nMinister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo said the proposed law is to repeal the Produce Enforcement of Standards Act 2004, which is currently in place.\n\nAdebayo said when passed, the new law will enable the ministry to establish five laboratories across the geo-political zones of the country, for microbial analysis of agro-products for local consumption and export.\n\n\u201cThe justification for the memo is primarily of the need to have an all-encompassing produce inspection regime in Nigeria that is capable of ensuring best practices in the export of produce from Nigeria. The proposed bill seeks to correct the shortcomings in the previous law. For instance, the organisational structure to which the law applies, which has increased to 72 from 16, the location covered by emergency orders for pest control use in the event of an outbreak.\u201d\n\nThe consultancy which is at the total sum of about N1.4 billion to Messrs Tata Consulting Engineers in partnership with Messrs Abigrants limited has 24 months completion period.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

We should be considered for the deputy governorship seat, National Assembly and even the Vice presidential ticket.\u201d However, a member of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and Deputy National Organising Secretary, Chidi Duru, described the request as wish list.\n\n\u201cYes, we have taken note of their requests and they are wish list. For now the issue of running mate for our presidential candidate is rested because we have submitted the name of Masari to the INEC and unless he withdraws from the position then every other consideration may be looked into, but now, their request is a wish list,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, another APC Women Inclusion in Governance group, under the auspices of Anty ZEE 774, yesterday, said as the 2023 elections approaches, Nigeria must address the sizeable gender gaps that undermine women\u2019s inclusion in governance.\n\n\u201cThere is sufficient and ever-increasing evidence that women inclusiveness in governance\n\nand political decision-making processes help nation-building,\u201d it said.\n\nA letter submitted to the national leadership of the party, and signed by the Grand Coordinator, Princess Ann Nwanyibuife Agom-Eze, lamented the spate of insecurity in the country urging government to take action to reverse the trend.\n\n\u201cNigeria is greatly wasting a precious resource in the gross under-utilisation and poor representation of women in governance and politics.

          "text": "\u2022Queues to disappear in few days, NNPC assures\n\n\u2022Depot owners lament, say N165 per litre unsustainable\n\n\u2022House summons national oil company, downstream regulatory authority, marketers over fuel scarcity, soaring diesel, gas prices\n\nPeter Uzoho and Gilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nDespite the position of some oil marketers that the current pump price for petrol in the country was unsustainable following long queues that have surfaced in some cities across the country, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) yesterday maintained that the pump price for premium motor spirit (PMS) remains at N165 per litre.\n\nThis was just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday assured Nigerians that it has over two billion litres of PMS that would last for the next 34 days in the country, adding that there was enough stock to meet the nation\u2019s demand.\n\nHowever, oil marketers under the aegis of Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) have empathised with their customers and the members of the public on the current distribution hiccups witnessed in the supply of petrol from the various petrol stations dispensing at N165 per litre, saying the price was unsustainable.\n\nBut the House of Representatives has summoned stakeholders in the Nigerian downstream oil and gas sector to appear before it today over the resurgence of petrol scarcity and queues in some parts of the country as well as the soaring prices of diesel and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nThe statement by the NMDPRA that insisted on N165 per litre for pump price, came on the heels of the recent agitation by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) that PMS sold at N165 was no longer sustainable.\n\nThe Executive Director, Distribution Systems, Storage and Retailing Infrastructure, NMDPRA, Mr. Ogbugo Kalu, who spoke at a media briefing said the Authority was ever ready to enforce the price on independent marketers who are planning to increase pump price to N180 per litre.\n\n\u201cPMS is a regulated product. The price is fixed and the ex-depot price is known. The pump price remains at N165. So we continue to urge Nigerians to keep within these operating rules,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, in the next three days, the Authority would focus its energy in making sure that the marine stock would be translated into inland stock to get petroleum products across the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cWithin a very short while, we will see the fuel queues pale out. So that is what our focus in the Authority and for the next few days we urge every operator and indeed even assure the public that whatever glitches and supply gaps that have been observed will disappear shortly.\n\n\u201cSo we do not encourage any panic buying. We urge Nigerians to be calm as these things will be resolved very easily.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Executive Director, NNPC, Adeyemi Adetunji, said over two billion litres of PMS that would last for the next 34 days was in country, adding that there was enough stock to meet the nation\u2019s demand. He assured that NNPC was working with the entire operators and stakeholders in the downstream sector to ensure that petroleum products get to distribution channels and filling stations across the country.\n\n\u201cWith all the apparatuses put in place, we can assure that all the fuel queues will disappear in the next few days. Nigerians will continue to enjoy the free flow of petroleum products,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director, Petroleum Pipeline Marketing Company (PPMC), Isiaku Abdullahi, said all hands were on the deck to support its marketers and transporters to ensure that petroleum products get to where they are needed.\n\nHe said there were about three vessels in the Apapa jetty waiting to offload more than 60 million metric tonnes, adding that in due course, the potential and imagined fuel crisis in Lagos would be over.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director, NIPCO Plc, Suresh Kumar, said his company was receiving 18 million litres of the 90,000 metric tonnes waiting to be offloaded at the Apapa jetty.\n\n\u201cI am happy to announce that we have another 32 million to be received from the vessels which are coming. So, with that in picture, you know, the supply gap or the supply logistic challenges which was there has been addressed.\n\n\u201cSo, the products are there with us, we can see that the trucks have started coming up. The Authority has given us the first approval to see that these products of about 30 to 40 million litres should be dispensed on a 24-hour basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, what I can categorically assure all Nigerians is that the product is there and it is going to flow into the trucks and they are going to move from here to the stations. So, they have to be rest assured they should not panic, panic is a problem, it will create high demand.\n\n\u201cSo without panic and if this normal situation functions, then everybody should be getting product in the next couple of days,\u201d he averred.\n\nDepot Owners Lament Unsustainable N165 Per Litre Petrol Pump Price\n\nHowever, DAPPMAN, in a statement issued last night, said the on-going Russian/Ukraine War had adversely affected the whole world, including the downstream oil and gas sector in Nigeria, impacting negatively on global and local fuel and food supply.\n\nIt said the international prices of these items had risen astronomically and had more than doubled their old rates since the beginning of the war, thereby causing extreme increases in local prices.\n\nBy extension, DAPPMAN said the local running costs of operating their various fuel depots had gone up astronomically, adding that the petrol they supply was sourced, solely from Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited\u2019s marketing subsidiary, Petroleum Products Marketing Company Limited (PPMC) for sale to the public at the regulated price of N165 per litre. It explained that this purchase was made by depot operators with funds sourced with high bank interest charges, alongside increased costs of hiring vessels, with which they deliver the fuel cargoes to their depots.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThese costs have doubled within the period of this Russian/Ukraine war.\n\nAdded to this is the scarcity of bunkers (ship\u2019s fuel). We also experienced astronomical increases in the cost of diesel used to power equipment and machinery in our various depots and our retail outlets.\n\n\u201cDepot Owners and the government have continued to struggle over time to sustain supply of PMS at the current pump price of N165 per litre despite the huge subsidy cost to government and abysmal margins to the Depot owners.\u201d\n\nThe marketers\u2019 association observed that if not for its suspension, the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 would have provided an ideal enabling environment by creating the free market in which demand and supply would affect fuel pump price.\n\n\u201cWe hereby assure the public that Depot Owners, working in concert with NNPC Limited, through its marketing subsidiary, will continue to work hard to ensure availability of products nationwide,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHouse Summons NNPC, NMDPRA, Marketers over Fuel Scarcity, Soaring Diesel, Gas Prices\n\nThe House of Representatives has summoned stakeholders in the Nigerian downstream oil and gas sector to appear before it today over the resurgence of petrol scarcity and queues in some parts of the country and the galloping rise in the prices of diesel and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nThe lawmakers in a letter signed by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) Hon. Mahmud Gaya, invited the heads of the stakeholder organisations and institutions in the Nigerian downstream petroleum sector.\n\nThose invited, in the letter seen by THISDAY, yesterday, included the Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) and that of the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC), two subsidiaries of NNPC Limited.\n\nOthers were the Chairman of the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAM), President of IPMAN and Chairman of DAPPMAN.\n\n\u201cYour various Memoranda should be forwarded to the Committee\u2019s secretariat in 60 print copies and a soft copy at the House of Representatives Complex on or before Wednesday 22 June, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs we look forward to receiving you, please accept the warmest assurances of the Joint Committee\u2019s highest esteem.\u201d, the concluding page of the letter read.\n\nFor the past few months, Nigerians have been going through difficulties to get petrol, diesel and cooking gas due to the scarcity and astronomical increase in the prices of the products, which are all imported.\n\nThe hike in the prices of the petroleum products, just like other commodities, has been blamed on the ongoing oil price rally, exacerbated by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the resultant trade sanctions against Russia, a major global supplier of refined petroleum products.\n\nA litre of diesel in Nigerian is currently selling for above N800 while a 12.5 kilogram of cooking gas is being sold for over N10,000 in some locations. This has pushed many users of the two products into using alternative sources like petrol generators, solar, inverters, firewood and charcoal.\n\nHowever, petrol that is still selling cheaper despite the global hike in prices, owing to the huge subsidy the country is spending to keep the pump price at N165 per litre, far less than the actual landing cost, is now becoming scarce and unavailable in some states including Lagos, Oyo, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nThe Chairman of IPMAN, Lagos Satellite Depot, Mr. Akin Akinrinade, had lamented the shortage of petrol in their depot, stated that since December 2021, not a litre of petrol had been lifted at the NNPC satellite depots at Ejigbo.\n\nThis, he noted, had left independent marketers at the mercy of private depots, whom he accused of hiking their ex- depot prices to a level no longer sustainable to sell petrol at N165.\n\nThe IPMAN chairman said based on current economic realities, the sustainable pump price for petrol in in the country should be at N180 per litre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The statement by the NMDPRA that insisted on N165 per litre for pump price, came on the heels of the recent agitation by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) that PMS sold at N165 was no longer sustainable.\nThe Executive Director, Distribution Systems, Storage and Retailing Infrastructure, NMDPRA, Mr. Ogbugo Kalu, who spoke at a media briefing said the Authority was ever ready to enforce the price on independent marketers who are planning to increase pump price to N180 per litre.\nThe pump price remains at N165.\nNigerians will continue to enjoy the free flow of petroleum products,\u201d he added.\nThe IPMAN chairman said based on current economic realities, the sustainable pump price for petrol in in the country should be at N180 per litre.",

          "text": "\u2022Insists subsidy removal good on paper, but has huge human consequences\n\n\u2022Reveals N152bn, $386m, \u00a31.1m, \u20ac157,000, others recovered in 2021\n\n\u2022Alleges IPOB lobbying US Congress with millions of dollars, must be declared terrorists\n\n\u2022Declares EU\u2019s trade policies rigged against Nigeria, other African countries\n\n\u2022On blasphemy, president insists no one has right to break the law\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, defended the policies being implemented by Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, saying rather than follow textbook solutions developed in the more advanced climes, which may not be suitable for Nigeria, the apex bank\u2019s head has rightly resorted to \u201cunorthodox\u201d measures in trying to resolve the country\u2019s economic challenges.\n\nIn his written responses to Bloomberg\u2019s interview questions, Buhari said the accusations against Emefiele by detractors, including being labelled as \u201cpolitical\u201d, had more to do with the methods he was deploying to try to revamp the Nigerian economy, rather than the substance of the allegations.\n\nThe president maintained that every country should have the right to choose its economic model and policies, insisting that the CBN chief is facing criticisms because he is not following traditional methods, which have failed in the past.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cBut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again.\n\n\u201cInstead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy. Nigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the independence of the office of the CBN governor, given Emefiele\u2019s alleged interest in the just-concluded presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president said if there were infractions, the board of the apex bank was better placed to sanction the governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the president. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Nigerian Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s Board of Directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nA critical actor in the federal government\u2019s efforts to boost local food production, the CBN has provided loans to farmers and restricted access to foreign exchange for importers of dozens of products, actions for which it has received flaks.\n\nBut Buhari insisted that food price inflation in the country could have been worse if Emefiele had not initiated organised programmes to boost domestic production, stressing that even at that , Nigeria still does not grow enough domestically.\n\nHe pointed out that initiatives, such as the Anchor Borrower\u2019s Programme, boosted rice production to nine million metric tonnes in 2021, from around 5.4 million metric tonnes in 2015.\n\n\u201cEven in the years of drought, rice production outstripped pre-2015 levels. Imports have fallen to near zero. We are making progress,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn why he had continued to retain subsidy on petrol, the president noted that even most Western countries were currently implementing fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhy would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander!\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, while the removal of subsidy may look good on paper, the impact on Nigerians would be largely negative and unbearable.\n\n\u201cWhat our Western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things,\u201d the president maintained.\n\nBuhari added that while his government had put in motion plans to remove fuel subsidy late last year, after further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\nWhile internal production for refined products would help mitigate the effect of subsidy removal, the president projected that capacity would increase markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries come on board.\n\nBuhari posited that he was winning the war against corruption, starting with the Whistleblowing Policy enacted in his first year in office, revealing that hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned within Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that the monies had now been deployed as social and welfare funds distributed directly to the poorest during the COVID-19 pandemic and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rail, and power.\n\nHe explained, \u201cAs an illustration, monetary recoveries (January-December) 2021 show that more than N152 billion has been recovered. Dollar recoveries for the year amount to over $386 million; GBP more than 1.1 million; Euro, about 157,000; Saudi Riyals about 1.7 million, some more in digital and other currencies.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Buhari had said international partners refused to return funds they held for decades to previous Nigerian administrations in the certainty they would simply be re-stolen.\n\n\u201cThey changed their approach with us because they knew my administration could be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said that his successor would inherit a far more resilient economy, thanks to investments in infrastructure and policies that he said had bolstered local production.\n\nOn security, the president reiterated that the military had recovered all territories previously held by Boko Haram, repeating his often-held position that terrorists no longer hold any territory in Nigeria while their leaders are now deceased.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cIn 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria. Today they are close to extinct as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Air Force airstrike in March.\u201d\n\nHe stated that jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations. He said these stood as testament to new trust re-built between Nigeria and its Western allies.\n\nThe Nigerian leader urged its international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and designating them as a terrorist organisation.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth. The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes.\n\n\u201cGovernors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced.\u201d\n\nHe further opined that international trade remained rigged against food security in Africa, explaining that while the European Union\u2019s policies are all rhetoric of open trade, their common agricultural policy undermines Africa\u2019s self-sufficiency and grows poverty.\n\nOn the rising spate of religion-related killings, especially regarding the question of alleged blasphemy, the president declared that no one has any right to break the law and urged Christians and Muslims to respect each other\u2019s differences.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Red chamber gets new minority leader, whip\n\n\u2022House steps down motion to override Buhari\u2019s veto on statutory delegates\n\n\u2022APC loses three more senators to opposition parties\n\nSunday Aborisade and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has asked the Senate to confirm the appointment of seven new ministerial nominees. The request was contained in a letter, which was read during plenary yesterday.\n\nThe new nominations came as the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the red chamber appointed Senators Phillip Aduda (FCT) and Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North) as the new Minority Leader and Minority Whip, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, three senators from APC resigned their membership of the ruling party and joined the opposition. They are Senators Ahmad Babba Kaita (Katsina North), Lawal Yahaya Gumau (Bauchi South), and Francis Alimikhena (Edo North). While Kaita and Alimikhena defected to the opposition PDP, Gumau defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nIn another development, the House of Representatives, yesterday, stepped down a motion seeking to override Buhari for failing to assent to Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\n\nThe ministerial nominees whose names were sent to the senate for confirmation included Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh \u2013 Abia State; Umana Okon Umana \u2013 Akwa Ibom State; Ekumankama Joseph Nkama \u2013 Ebonyi State; and Goodluck Nana Opiah \u2013 Imo State.\n\nOthers were Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub \u2013 Kano State; Ademola Adewole Adegoroye \u2013 Ondo State; and Odum Odi \u2013 Rivers State.\n\nThey would replace ministers, who resigned their appointments in the wake of the APC presidential primary election recently.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan read Buhari\u2019s letter requesting confirmation of the nominees on the floor of the Senate during plenary.\n\nBuhari state in the letter that the confirmation request was in accordance with the provisions of Section 147 subsection 2 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended.\n\nMeanwhile the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the red chamber has appointed Senators Phillip Aduda (FCT) and Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North) as the new Minority Leader and Minority Whip respectively.\n\nLawan read the letter from PDP on the choice of new Minority Leader and Minority Whip at the start of plenary. National Secretary of PDP, Senator Samuel Anyawu, signed the letter.\n\nAduda\u2019s nomination was sequel to the resignation of the former Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe. Abaribe announced his defection from PDP to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) last week.\n\nPDP, in its letter to the senate president, explained that Utazi\u2019s nomination as new Minority Whip was as a result of the elevation of Aduda to the position of Minority Leader.\n\nHouse Steps Down Motion to Override Buhari\u2019s Veto on Statutory Delegates\n\nThe House of Representatives stepped down a motion seeking to override Buhari for failing to assent to Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\n\nThe move to override the president\u2019s veto followed the failure of majority of lawmakers currently serving in the Senate and House of Representatives to secure their return tickets at the party primaries held last month. The mass failure was blamed on the ad hoc delegate system of candidates\u2019 selection.\n\nTwo members of PDP, Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, and Hon. Ben Igbakpa, who were among those that failed to get tickets to seek re-election, had protested on the floor of the House last Wednesday.\n\nThe National Assembly passed and transmitted the proposed legislation to the president about 30 days ago, the window within which the legislature could veto the president\u2019s decline of assent to the bill.\n\nIgbakpa, who represents Ethiope Federal Constituency of Delta State, had at the plenary last week raised a constitutional point of order, citing Section 58 (8) of the 1999 Constitution, which empowers the National Assembly to enact laws and also override the president with two0third majority of the members\u2019 vote.\n\nSpeaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, who affirmed that Mr. President was in breach of the 30 days provided to communicate his decision to withhold assent, urged Igbakpa to formally present a motion in that regard.\n\nPresenting the motion, titled, \u201cNeed to Invoke Section 58(5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, to Pass Again the Electoral Act, 2022,\u201d at plenary, Igbakpa noted that the time frame for the president to assent or decline assent to the bill elapsed since June 11.\n\nHe lamented that the inability of the president to perform his constitutional duty was an affront on Section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, which empowered the National Assembly to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the federation or any part thereof.\n\nIgbakpa said the continued inaction of the president in either assenting or vetoing the bill had left a lacuna in Nigeria\u2019s constitutional democracy, which portended danger for the 2023 electoral process and other subsequent staggered elections of some states. This left the congresses of political parties in the hands of ad-hoc delegates to the detriment of statutory delegates.\n\nThe lawmaker prayed his colleague to invoke Section 58(5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) with respect to the bill and communicate the position of the House of Representatives to the senate for concurrence.\n\nHowever, after presenting the motion, Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, who presided over the session, said according to the House rules, a motion could not be used to override a bill, hence the lawmaker should step down the motion and liaise with the chairman, Rules and Business, Hon. Hassan Fulata, to do the needful.\n\nReacting, Igbakpa reminded the deputy speaker that the speaker, Gbajabiamila, was the one who directed him last week to bring the matter in form of a motion.\n\nSpeaking, also, on the matter, Chairman, House Committee on Navy, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi (APC, Plateau), said if the motion mover would be able to instigate the National Assembly to have the required 240 members that would vote yes to override the president on that law and if the intention of overriding him was to address that lacuna then he would support it.\n\nAPC Loses Three More Senators to Opposition Parties\n\nThree APC senators resigned their membership of the ruling party. Senators Ahmad Babba Kaita (Katsina North), and Francis Alimikhena (Edo North) defected to PDP, while Lawal Yahaya Gumau (Bauchi South), joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nThe notice of their resignation and defection was contained in three separate letters read during plenary by Lawan yesterday.\n\nKaita\u2019s letter read in part, \u201cAs senator representing Katsina North Senatorial District, I write to formally notify you of my resignation from the APC, and registration declaration for the PDP.\n\n\u201cMy resignation from the APC was born out of the marginalisation of critical stakeholders by the state government and leadership of the party in Katsina State, where small people like me do not have a chance.\n\n\u201cI have since been joyful and graciously accepted into the fold of the PDP in Katsina State.\u201d\n\nAlimikhena, on the other hand, explained that his decision to resign from APC was the result of \u201ccontinuing and multifaceted crisis that has bedevilled the APC\u201d, especially in his senatorial district. \u201cThat has created parallel executives that has undermined internal discipline, cohesion and focus,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defection of the three lawmakers reduced the total number of APC senators from 64 to 62 in the upper chamber, while PDP has risen from 39 to 41. Also, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) now has two, Young Progressive Party (YPP), one, and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) one.\n\nThe remaining two seats are vacant due to the positions of National Chairman and Deputy National Chairman of APC now occupied by Senators Adamu Abdullahi (Nasarawa West) and Abubakar Kyari (Borno North).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The attempt to settle out of court, the allegation of fraud between Chief Cletus Ibeto of Ibeto Energy Development Company Limited; the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Dozzy Oil & Gas Limited has hit the rocks.\n\n\n\nAt the resumed hearing on Tuesday of the case at the Port Harcourt High Court, presided over by Justice Boma Diepiri, the counsel for Chief Cletus Ibeto and Dozzy Oil & Gas Limited, Henry Bello and Okey Obikeze informed the court that settlement could not be reached between the parties.\n\nThe matter was subsequently adjourned to July 11, 2022, for a further report on the settlement.\n\n\n\nRecall that Dozzy Oil & Gas Limited had through its solicitors, Messrs Anthony Stephens & Associates, written a petition on a case of obtaining by false pretence, fraudulent conversion of property, criminal breach of trust, forgery and deception against Chief Cletus Ibeto and his group of companies, Ibeto Energy Development Company Limited and Odoh Holdings Limited.\n\n\n\nDozzy, had in the petition to the EFCC alleged that Chief Cletus Ibeto, a close friend of the executive chairman on the basis of which it dealt on trust with him, offered to sell his company\u2019s property situated at NITECO Shipyard Area, Reclamation II Layout, Port Harcourt, Rivers State to Dozzy and had collected an advance deposit of N4,800,000,000 from the company.\n\nHe said this was done before the company carried out due diligence searches at the Lands Registry office in Port Harcourt, wherein it discovered that the portion of land which Chief Ibeto sought to sell to it did not belong to him or his companies, but to Nigeria Technical Company Limited (NITECO).\n\n\n\nThe company, in its petition, stated that while Ibeto had by a Deed of Sub-lease registered as No. 48/48/280 in the Lands Registry office in Port Harcourt been granted a sub-lease of 7.8 acres of land by Odoh Holdings Limited, which had an earlier grant from Nigeria Shipbuilders Limited, a subsidiary of NITECO, he offered 20 hectares of land to Dozzy when it can only lay legitimate claim to 7.8 acres even at that; the said 7.8 acres of land was not part of the portion Chief Ibeto sought to sell to it.\n\n\n\nThe company further alleged that the copy of Ibeto\u2019s title deeds that it gave to it was different from the counterpart copy in the Port Harcourt Lands Registry when it carried out its searches.\n\n\n\nThe company equally alleged that the Rivers State Government ground rent receipts given to it by Chief Ibeto as further evidence of its title to the land, purportedly issued by the Rivers State Inland Revenue Service, was forged, a claim corroborated by the EFCC in its counter-affidavit deposed to by Mohammed Bala, one of the investigating officers in EFCC\u2019s opposition to the fundamental rights enforcement suit.\n\n\n\nEFCC had in the counter affidavit stated that its investigation which extended to the Rivers State Inland Revenue Service raised a strong case of forgery against Chief Cletus Ibeto as the River State Inland Revenue Service denied authorship of the revenue collectors receipt given to Dozzy by Chief Cletus Ibeto.\n\n\n\nAfter several failed appointments, Ibeto honoured EFCC\u2019s invitations on January 27, 2022, and after making his written statement to the EFCC had his appointment rescheduled to enable him to produce his title documents to the subject property, which he claimed to own.\n\n\n\nHowever, the accused person approached the Port Harcourt High Court to file the present suit for the enforcement of his fundamental rights and injunction to restrain the EFCC from investigating the allegations of fraud made against him.\n\n\n\nThe defence counsel, Henry Bello, had at the last hearing requested for adjournment of the suit to enable the parties to explore the settlement which has failed.",

          "text": "Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, says the federal government will soon resolve issues on the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nASUU had, on February 14, declared a one-month warning strike to protest the non-implementation of its demands by the federal government.\n\nBut on March 14, the union extended the action by eight weeks, citing the government\u2019s failure to fully address its demands.\n\nOn May 6, Ngige had promised that the federal government will resume negotiations with ASUU with the aim of ending the strike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, three days after his promise, the union extended the strike by another 12 weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, while addressing journalists after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Ngige said the government will soon resolve issues causing the strike.\n\nHe also said issues concerning the payment platforms will be addressed in the next meeting fixed for Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt will be resolved very soon. As the issue is bordered on money, remunerations, welfare, we did another conciliation meeting inviting the ministry of finance, budget office of the federation, National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission and again, with their employers on the 1st of March,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfter that, it became clear that two cardinal things were still keen \u2014 the issue of renegotiation of their welfare package as in the 2009 agreement; that agreement says you can review every five years, so, that issue stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\n\u201cThen another issue arose in that agreement \u2014 the payment platform of university transparency, accountability solution, which they say they\u2019ve invented. They said they don\u2019t want to be on IPPIS; that IPPIS was amputating their salaries and taking off certain allowances, and so, that it is not capturing their peculiarities.\n\n\u201cSo, we now have to ask them to go back to these places, form committees with them. Education took them on the issue of 2009 agreement, which is renegotiation of their conditions of service, emolument, their remuneration allowances. Therefore, salaries, income and wages, and ministry of finance that produce the money are involved. So, they went back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they are \u2014 what we call tripartite plus meeting \u2014 based on the presidential directive that the chief of staff, myself, finance, education, find a solution.\n\n\u201cThat meeting held in the banquet hall. We gave an instruction again for them to come back with terms. So, as I speak to you, as the arbitrator or conciliator-in-chief, I have not gotten back any of the reports from education, from salaries, incomes and wages, nor from ASUU because they\u2019re supposed to report to me.\n\n\u201cBut on the government side, we\u2019re calling up a meeting tomorrow so that everybody on the government side can report if there\u2019s a problem, so we know how to address it.\u201d\n\nThe adoption of the payment platform has caused some friction between ASUU and the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) over the integrity test conducted on the university transparency accountability solution (UTAS).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Kashifu Inuwa, director-general of NITDA, said UTAS failed three integrity tests.\n\nAccording to him, the tests were meant to qualify UTAS \u2014 which was brought forward by ASUU \u2014 as an alternative payment platform to the government\u2019s integrated payroll and personnel information system (IPPIS).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Ngige had earlier said the insistence of the academic union on the immediate adoption of UTAS is delaying negotiations.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The foundation was set up by a former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Solomon Arase, who celebrated his 66th birthday.\n\nCommending Arase and other residents for their support in tackling insecurity in the state, the governor expressed satisfaction that \u201ccitizens of Edo State on their own spend time to rethink the security situation of the State, task themselves and raise resources to complement the government\u2019s efforts at tackling the security challenges in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki further charged leaders across the country on selflessness, urging them on the need to give back to society, contributing effectively to the development of their communities.\n\nHe said leaders must invest in giving back to the society that made them, ensuring the empowerment of the less-privileged in society.\n\nCommending the philanthropic gesture of former Inspector General of Police, Arase, the governor said, \u201cWe thank you for your support and leadership. You are not one of the wealthiest of public officers but rich in terms of spirit. It\u2019s not how much you have received but how much you have given back to society.\n\n\u201cOur society requires so much from us. What is important for us now as elites is what we can give back to society. You are one of the best, finest, and most intelligent police officers ever produced in this country. We are proud of your achievements as you are passionate and in love with the profession of policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sole responsibility of the government is to provide security. Without security, we have no need for the government. This shows the importance of security in Nigeria. I am glad you are now in the vanguard of pushing for citizens\u2019 policing in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, Arase said, \u201cThe people must come together to fight insecurity, which is our common enemy. This should be the model we must use and leave behind for Edo people. We have to team up as there are a lot of ungoverned spaces in this country. We must galvanise our youths to deepen security in the state and ensure the safety of our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe items donated include one sienna vehicle, 500 motorcycles, over 1,000 customised T-shirts, face caps, raincoats, torch lights, and ant whistles. These kits should be judiciously utilised to improve the security situation in the state. This foundation was set up in 2016 when I was retiring from the police force.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecurity is capital intensive and we all need to support the government to combat crime in our society as the government cannot do it alone unless through our collaborative efforts,\u201d Arase added\n\nReassuring of improved security in the state, the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro pledged, \u201cWe will fight crime and criminality to the highest level in Edo State. We will not be reactive but proactive in fighting crime. We will take the fight to them and ensure the state is uncomfortable for criminals.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe thoughtful increase in substantial percentage and commencement of payment of the new Minimum Wage from N30,000 to N40,000 in May 2022 by Edo State Government, is evidently a humane testament of Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s genuine concern for workers\u2019 quandary in the Nigeria system.\n\nIn the same vein, Governor Godwin Obaseki also judiciously approved the harmonisation of Pensioners\u2019 take home, to cushion their pain and lack in the midst of current economic free fall across the country. This harmonisation, obviously led to the recent verification of all the pensioners in the State properly tagged: \u201cI am Alive.\u201d\n\nAll these put together, is an eloquent expression of the Governor\u2019s desire, not only to incentivise workers against the spike of inflation, unregulated economy as well as the prevailing harsh standard of living in the country, but also a manifestation of his verifiable understanding of the possibilities of inherent genuine principles of affirmative Federalism in our system.\n\nIn an ideal situation for instance, the considerate Minimum wage, such as the newly implemented increase in Edo and the gesture towards the pensioners for example, both have the obvious consequent of not only impacting direct motivational factor on workers; whether active, retired or potential employees; but should also affect immediately, economic viability, standard of living and most importantly, less mobility of qualified and efficient workers in the State civil and public service.\n\nIn other words, Minimum wage, depending on the prevailing inflationary trend, has the potential value to affect productivity, income inequality, economic growth, self-improvement and employee retention.\n\nAlthough not precisely justifiable, the State labour Union for example, with obvious understanding of the complex predicament of the current Nigeria system, could not legitimately or morally demand for the inevitable increase, due to the very fact that there is a prevailing prescribed National Minimum Wage, which many states are still negotiating and others very belligerent to implement.\n\nIt is therefore imperative to generally appreciate the patience and understanding of labour in this regard, as well as the general cohesive policy of Edo State Government being collectively harnessed for a better and harmonious Edo State Civil Service.\n\nTo this end therefore, it is important to appreciate, commend and give Governor Godwin Obaseki enormous kudos for his thought-visibility in the increase of the new Minimum Wage in Edo State.\n\nGovernor Obaseki, without doubt, equally deserves legendary gratitude for his vision and focus, not only expressed so far in the improvement of infrastructure in the State, but also as it affects the gratified government personnel who are sincerely excited by the gesture. This is particularly so, in the sense that the recent increase of the minimum wage from N30,000.00 to N40,000.00 in the State, was solely prompted by the Governor, processed and effected as a form of economic empathy, without any pressure or coercion from any stakeholder.\n\nThis is particularly reassuring in the fact that Edo State Government, under the leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki, in spite of the limited and scarce revenue resources, is manifestly capable of engaging ingenuous positive strategies as could be necessitated by policy preferences, fiscal demands and excellent discretion in governance.\n\nThe speed and promptness with which the minimum wage increase was processed and implemented, visibly expressed the genuine heartfelt of Edo State Government for its workforce, who on the long run, are persistently being pressed by the repressive Nigeria political and economic nuances.\n\nSpecifically, the basic essence of minimum wage for workers and labour is to be able to provide sufficient food, shelter and other basic necessities for self and family. Of all these basic and necessary securities, research has shown that government can hardly and sufficiently regulate these comfort or provide them in abundance for its workforce and its people through wage alone.\n\nThis is largely so, due to pervading believe that government has no business in the production of consumable goods and services. Instead, they are tend to perpetually concerned themselves with the need to providing enabling environment through policies. Ironically, these enabling environments have continued to be subjugated by some private individuals usually called small, medium or large scale investors.\n\nGoing by this thought process, it will absolutely be very difficult for any government, whether at the local, state or federal level, to control, regulate service providers, sanctions defaulters or even fix the prices of goods and services that could be commensurate with any minimum wage. In other words, Government cannot adequately and successfully fix and regulate the price of goods and services they do not produce, especially with the absent of strong regulating institutions in the country.\n\nThis ambivalent scenario would at all times, leave the wage earner and even the government at the mercy of market forces, whose managers, even under normal circumstances, are only concerned with immediate and overkill profit for their capital and legitimate investments.\n\nThis conundrum therefore, will certainly continue to reverberate as a result of the ever dwindling value of the Nigeria currency \u2013 the Naira, imperfect values and reactionary policies and lack of sustainable government involvement in production processes. It will as well continue to manifest, due to the greed and insincerity on the part of private exploitative individuals, just as the collective shylocks system appear to be very visible in every department of our social lives without any feelings or concerned for the wage earners or the collective wellbeing.\n\nIn this regard, it is very unfortunate therefore, to logically explain that a dedicated worker, who has been loyal and committed to his duties and responsibilities, having put in thirty-five (35) years in the service is hardly able to build a living house for himself and family, ride a good car and train his/her children in good schools. These underlying indices, in line with capacity, efficiency and competitive productive engagements are what should normally define earned wage on the long run and help to break the painful chain of poverty and recycle penury for the average worker and eventual pensioners.\n\nNevertheless, it is very important therefore, to emphasise that the substantial review and the prompt implementation of the new minimum wage in Edo, which is higher than the statutory prescription in Nigeria, as well as more than any other state in the country by the Edo State Governor, is absolutely in the right direction and highly commendable.\n\nThis gesture will certainly spur Edo State workers to be hopeful, believing that their Governor, Godwin Obaseki is certainly concerned with the economically-induced dwindling value of their wage, understands their plight and very ready and willing to do the possibilities whenever and wherever necessary.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing therefore, it is suffice to say that Governor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki has sufficiently done very well in this regard and has eternally added another constructive legacy, which will remain ever positive in the annals of posterity.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",
          "summary": "In the same vein, Governor Godwin Obaseki also judiciously approved the harmonisation of Pensioners\u2019 take home, to cushion their pain and lack in the midst of current economic free fall across the country.\nIn other words, Minimum wage, depending on the prevailing inflationary trend, has the potential value to affect productivity, income inequality, economic growth, self-improvement and employee retention.\nIt is therefore imperative to generally appreciate the patience and understanding of labour in this regard, as well as the general cohesive policy of Edo State Government being collectively harnessed for a better and harmonious Edo State Civil Service.\nTo this end therefore, it is important to appreciate, commend and give Governor Godwin Obaseki enormous kudos for his thought-visibility in the increase of the new Minimum Wage in Edo State.\nSpecifically, the basic essence of minimum wage for workers and labour is to be able to provide sufficient food, shelter and other basic necessities for self and family.",

Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

At night, these suspects raid the nearby villages for young men to kill or kidnap; and, as a result people now run helter skater for their dear lives. Reports from these areas predict that If care is not taken promptly, famine may set-in in no distant time.\u201d\n\nIt will be recalled that just a couple of days ago, the Methodist Church Prelate Bishop Samuel Kanu, with two other clerics were kidnapped within this hot zone and released after paying N100m ransom.\n\nSeveral other criminal activities have taken roots there and yet, there are close-by check-points, manned by men in uniforms.\n\nFollowing the incessant cases of banditry along this Umunneochi axis of the Enugu Okigwe Express-Way, youths from the area came together to call on government and security operatives to intervene to check the menace.\n\nA few days ago Abia state Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu inaugurated a Special Security Committee for Umunneochi Local Government Area with assurance to support the Committees until the story of security returns to normalcy in the area.\n\nHe charged the committee to stamp-out strange elements who have no business in Umunneochi, Isuikwuato and Ukwa-West forests but merely constituted themselves into security threats.\n\nHe also charged the committee to deepen intelligence about what is happening in the area especially movement around the area.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of the committee in Umuahia, Ikpeazu directed the Committee to take over all ungoverned spaces in Umunneochi, in particular, and set- up systems that will lead to the apprehension of all elements who have become a nuisance to the people of the Council.\n\nHe assured that government will provide all that is needed to make their job successful and announced immediate provision of a patrol vehicle and motorcycles to serve as enablers to their assignment.",

          "text": "Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission Mr. Lamido Yuguda has stated that any country to be among the most economically advanced in the comity of nations, serious attention must be paid to the development of a credible and stable capital market, which is an essential precondition for a well-functioning economy.\n\nYuguda who stated this at the First Nigeria Employers Summit organized by the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association in Abuja, noted that such credibility and stability are not guaranteed by market mechanisms alone, but regulation too.\n\nThe SEC Boss said the Commission brings significant regulations to the capital market and has over the years, continued to put in place clear and consistently applied regulatory frameworks to reduce regulatory and operational impediments and engender the smooth functioning of the market.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the apex regulator of the Nigerian capital market, the SEC has executed several initiatives to build a collaborative regulatory environment for enterprise competitiveness, job creation and national development. Through its ten-year Capital Market Master Plan (2015-2025), which serves as the primary roadmap for the development of the Nigerian capital market, the Commission has mapped out strategies to build a capital market that is the largest on the continent of Africa and one of the world\u2019s deepest by 2025. The Masterplan\u2019s implementation has been admitted as the 246th programme and project in the recently approved National Development Plan 2021-2025 (NDP2515033).\n\n\u201cThe Commission continues to enhance its regulatory framework through the issuance of Rules to keep pace with market trends. Recent ones include rules on Investment-based Crowdfunding, which created an enabling environment for capital raising by start-ups and on Annual Renewal of Registration of Capital Market Operators to ensure only fit and proper persons operate in the Nigerian Capital Market.\u201d\n\nThe SEC DG said the Commission has continued to strive to fulfill its mandate of protecting investors and creating an enabling environment for market operations and has remained consistent in its mandate of ensuring that the market provides an important channel of financing for the real sector to drive economic growth; allocate risk appropriately; support financial stability and smoothen transmission of monetary policy.\n\nHe however noted that the capital market is making efforts to do more in the areas of provision of long-term funds to develop infrastructure for the country and support developmental projects, canvassing the need to further deepen the Nigerian capital market for it to contribute the required long-term capital that Nigeria needs for business investment, infrastructure and other innovative financing.\n\n\u201cThe gains of capital market development will be macroeconomic development, lower transaction cost, greater liquidity, improved productivity and infrastructure development. The development of the capital market will facilitate a housing finance revolution. It will facilitate improved allocation of capital and provide small, medium and large companies access to the market to raise funds; facilitate foreign inflows of capital; raise productivity growth and lower unemployment. Capital market development is a spur for growth; improved living standards and efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these efforts will be superior economic performance of the Nigerian economy\u201d he added.\n\nYuguda stated that Since its formation in 1957, NECA has earned a reputation as a viable platform for interaction between private sector employers, government, labour and other relevant stakeholders. We at the Securities and Exchange Commission, identify with NECA\u2019s commitment and drive towards promoting a favourable environment for businesses to thrive and contribute maximally to national development.\n\nAccording to him, the theme for this year\u2019s summit \u201cThe Private Sector \u2013 An Engine for National Development\u201d would not have come at a better time than now, when nations are working to manage their economies amidst the devastating effects of Covid-19 and unraveling global political developments.\n\nHe said. \u201cI must also mention that the topic, \u201cBuilding a Collaborative Regulatory Environment for Enterprise Competitiveness, Job Creation and National Development\u201d is a tacit reminder that building a viable economic system requires cooperation and commitment of all relevant stakeholders operating in a robust regulatory environment.\n\n\u201cI am therefore thrilled to speak on a topic consistent with our professional engagements at the Securities and Exchange Commission especially as the Commission harps on developing and regulating a Dynamic, Fair, Transparent and Efficient Capital Market that will contribute to the nation\u2019s economic development",

The first memo was presented on behalf of our parastatal, the Nigeria social insurance Trust Fund (NSITF).\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019re aware, a lot has happened in the NSITF in terms of revenue losses and pillage of funds that have been given to that organization.\n\n\u201cThe NSITF implements the Employee Compensation Act ECA 2010 and by that Act, Employers in both public and private sectors are supposed to pay one percent of the emoluments of their staff into a social fund in NSITF.\n\n\u201cAnd this one is to be used as a primium or insurance fund to cater for workers or staff members who have accidents, injuries, disabilities and even deaths that occur in the cause of their work. So it\u2019s like an accident or injury insurance.\n\n\u201cThe Pension Act makes reference to it that it must be done for workers in addition to the group life. So, the monies that have gone in there have not been properly utilized, the payments have not been tracked.\n\n\u201cSo today we brought to council a memo for an e-NSITF by which their operations will now be digitalized. Both the payments that are put in from any of their stations, they have 56 branches and 11 regional offices. So in the comfort of your office, you can pay and register in that platform and that money is now tracked into Central pool.\n\n\u201cFor from the central pool if claims are made and payments are also made to the insurance on those who are beneficiaries, you also track them.\n\n\u201cSo this is one of the things the government has done in the spirit of digitalization of the economy and ease of doing business for everybody.\n\n\u201cSo this will make for efficiency and help the organization to grow it leaps and bounds. already the organization is revitalized following the present restructuring agreement for them.\n\n\u201cToday. NSITF can pay all their salaries, they can boast of even doing capital projects. And this digitization of funds operation is part of the capital project that they are doing and like I said earlier, the accountability that is there will make for non-leakages of funds.\n\n\u201cWe also know that previously, they have been complaints of claims not being paid but with e-NSITF will track claims and allow people to know who and who benefits from those claims. So this is one of the memos presented today.\n\n\u201cA consultant is going to handle it and council approved that the digitalization should be completed in eight weeks.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that the e-NSITF will cost N1.2 billion. He also said that council approved a portal called Nigerian Labour Exchange, NILEX which will be domiciled in his ministry for employment and job creation.\n\n\u201cThe second approval has to do with employment and job creation. It is a portal called Nigerian Labour Exchange (NILEX), housed in my ministry.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the platform had not been developed over time and could not take stress of the number of people wanting to go into it, stressing that the digital platform was supposed to be used by employers on one hand and job seekers on the other.\n\n\u201cThe employers will come in and load the vacancy they have, the type of skill they want, the qualifications of people that can fit in there.\n\n\u201cThen the job seekers those who are looking for job, graduates, non-graduates will register, put in the qualification, put in their skill and what you can do and then the two groups are matched. The employer can speak with a job seeker, via that platform.\n\n\u201cSo over the years we have not been able to expand it. But on a bilateral, multilateral agreement now the funds are provided. So we are redesigning it, remodeling it, and then upgrading the infrastructure.\n\n\u201cCouncil approved that consultant also do that with a completion period of 12 weeks and with that we have passed the first stage of digitalizing that particular platform.\n\n\u201cOne of the good things about our platform now when it becomes operational, all those phones platforms that ask people to register for work, pay in N10,000 or N20,000, will become a thing of the past because this will be a government platform. And when you go there, you know is a genuine platform.\n\n\u201cApart from that, people in diaspora can also upload their expertise and tell Nigerians, what they have that qualifies them for special jobs and if they are employers in Nigeria that need them, again there will be a handshake through that same portal.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Federal Government has approved the opening of employment and job creation portals for the unemployed Nigerians living in the country and in the Diaspora.\nNgige also said that the council approved the digitization of the operations of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, NSITF.\n\u201cA consultant is going to handle it and council approved that the digitalization should be completed in eight weeks.\u201dThe minister said that the e-NSITF will cost N1.2 billion.\nHe also said that council approved a portal called Nigerian Labour Exchange, NILEX which will be domiciled in his ministry for employment and job creation.\n\u201cThe second approval has to do with employment and job creation.",

          "title": "NNPC Achieved This By Teamwork",
          "text": "BY NSE ANTHONY-UKO, Abuja\n\nThe group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari has attributed the LEADERSHIP Award to the teamwork of the management and staff of the company, noting that the recognition would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all NNPC staffers.\n\nHe spoke yesterday when he received the award letter, presented to him by the editor-in-chief, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Azu Ishiekwene, who led other management staff on a courtesy visit to the NNPC Towers.\n\nKyari emerged LEADERSHIP CEO of The Year2021 for his strategic intervention in turning the NNPC into a profit-making national oil company and driving the present administration\u2019s gas revolution among other innovations.\n\nAn elated Kyari said, \u201cIt is really a privilege to be recognised by LEADERSHIP as \u2018CEO Of The Year\u2019. To me, CEO means chief education officer, if you cannot educate you shouldn\u2019t be a CEO, and you can\u2019t execute if you don\u2019t have people to work with you.?\n\nHe described NNPC as the largest enterprise in the country, saying it hosts the brightest of people that can be found in the oil industry.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey (multinational oil companies) know that we have better-skilled people in NNPC than they do. They know that we have better capacity than they do.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of this and any recognition anyone has here is to all of us. It would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all of us. And I congratulate our team for the recognition and we\u2019ll continue to execute in a critical manner, particularly in an area where we can get our economy supported by making sure that energy is available to all Nigerians in an affordable and sustainable manner so that prosperity can be generated in a bigger way and ultimately many of the indices that you have seen around including lack of security and peace would be minimised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the gesture and the consideration and on behalf of all of us here, we thank you most immensely.\u201d\n\nKyari said the overall plan is to make NNPC operate as a multi-trillion naira company, the most capitalised company in the country, having the highest assets of any company in Africa and be the biggest company in Africa.\n\nHe admitted that the NNPC has had its constraints which were being addressed through the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cIt simply means that this is the company that will compete with anyone else in any manner possible as allowed by the law, and we will do better than any other company. More than that we have a responsibility to be accountable to our shareholders, the over 200 million Nigerians and that is why we are doing very many strange things that companies don\u2019t do. One of them is that we are the only company that publishes its activities on monthly basis, it\u2019s not done anywhere in the world. We have challenged many companies to come out and do the same and no one can do this.\n\n\u201cSecondly, against all odds that you may think, we dared and published our audited financial statements and with the team spirit that we have, we were able to cut our costs and shape our business and we came out with positive numbers subsequently.\n\n\u201cWe are now publishing all the PMS evacuation from the depots. Every litre of product that has left the depot, we publish it and those that are available. Anyone can cross check it. We are also moving down to the level of the states, we will know for each state which area and which filling station it goes to and whether or not it was sold in the filling station. We have full data around every litre of product that comes into the country.\n\n\u201cNext, we are trying to refine so that we\u2019ll have refined product data. We can also tell Nigerians, what this subsidy conversation means and put numbers around it and publish for Nigerians to see\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Editor-in-Chief of LEADERSHIP, Mr Azu Ishiekwene told the NNPC Management that the award was in recognition of Kyari\u2019s modest efforts in repositioning the NNPC and putting it on the path to profitability.\n\nMr Ishiekwene was accompanied on the visit by the group managing director, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Muazu Elazeh and director, LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Abraham Nda-Isaiah.\n\nThe formal presentation of the award and conference is scheduled to be held on 17th May, 2022 at the International Conference Centre.",

          "text": "As the Campaign trail of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola moved to Obokun and Oriade Local Government Areas of the State, on Wednesday, monarchs in Obokun/Oriade federal constituency have described Oyetola as the pillar of Osun\u2019s sustainable growth in the last three and half years.\n\nThey also described the governor as a competent, performing leader that is deserving of a reelection, just as they commended him for bringing stability to the affairs of the state at a time when the political situation was full of uncertainties.\n\nThe monarchs also lauded Oyetola for investing in the improved security architecture of the state, adding that Osun has become the most peaceful state in the country as a result of his attention to security.\n\nThey urged their subjects to set sentiment aside and make a wise decision that guarantees greater development and a brighter future.\n\nThis is as the Osun All Progressives Congress (APC) welcomed scores of defectors from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Obokun and Oriade into the Party.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the other monarchs, the President of Ijesha North Traditional Rulers\u2019 Council, Ajalaye of Ipetu-Ijesha, Oba Adeleke Agunbiade, described Oyetola as a competent administrator, a distinguished leader and a humane politician, saying his performance in the last three and half years shows he was built for the job of governance.\n\nOba Agunbiade also lauded Oyetola for the way he has transformed the fortune of the state, declaring his readiness to campaign for the governor\u2019s re-election.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe the monarchs in Osun State have seen your work. In an ideal setting, you shouldn\u2019t be touring the State on campaign again because your works speak for you in the nooks and crannies of the State.\n\n\u201cMost of the monarchs in Osun and in Ijeshaland precisely are professionals. This reality has put us in the position to act as assessors of your performances across different sectors. From our assessment, we can boldly submit that Governor Oyetola is a competent governor, a leader par excellence, and a humane politician with human heart.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knew Osun in the past will testify that this governor has done wonderfully well. Those thinking they can wrestle power from him should think twice, because after Oyetola, it is still Oyetola.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying this to make him feel good, we are ready to throw our weight behind him. If we are not breaking any known law, we are ready to lead Oyetola\u2019s reelection campaign. As a matter of fact, I am offering myself as the Director-General of his campaign among the monarchs\u201d, Oba Agunbiade said.\n\nSpeaking in their Palaces, the Alademore of Ibokun, Oba Festus Kayode Awogboro; the Elegboro of Ijebu-Jesa, Oba Moses Oluwafemi Agunsoye, and the Owamiran of Esa-Oke, Oba Adeyemi Adediran, lauded Oyetola\u2019s commitment to educational reform and security of the state, among other critical areas of development.\n\nThe monarchs also commended Oyetola for prioritising the welfare of both monarchs and their subjects, urging citizens to show favourable disposition to him because he has been tried and found competent.\n\nWhile addressing the crowd at the various campaign grounds, where some defectors were received, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola assured the people that the modest achievements of his administration in the last three and half years are a foretaste of greater developments that his second term will bring to the state when re-elected.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe welfare and wellbeing of the good people of Osun, as well as the overall development of the State, hold a centrestage in my heart, and the modest achievements of my administration so far testify to this fact.\n\n\u201cWe have paid salaries in the most amazing ways \u2014 amazing because resources are limited but we found a way to fulfil our obligations. We are dutifully paying pensions and we are offsetting backlogs. We have given the state infrastructural face-lift as much as affordable. These and many more we have shown commitment to and we will not relent in our commitment.\n\n\u201cWe are approaching governance as we should. This is government of the people and for the people, and you can testify that the people have been at the centre of our programmes. Just take it that what you have seen in our first term is a taste of a sweeter sensation in our second term\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Prince Gboyega Famodun, and the Director-General of the Campaign Council, Senator Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru, said Osun has stepped up significantly with Oyetola in the saddle.\n\nThey urged citizens to support the governor\u2019s re-election, saying Osun does not deserve a downgrade from the high standards already set in the last three and half years.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the defectors, Babatunde Olayemi from Ward 10, Ilare Obokun, said their coming into the Party is not an espionage mission but a genuine passion to align with a government and a party that have showed distinction in governance.",

          "title": "Senate probes Shell over joint venture breach, seeks $200m refund to FG",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Senate Wednesday constituted an Ad-Hoc Committee to investigate Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) over non-compliance with the Petroleum Act and breach of the Joint Venture Agreement entered into with the federal government.\n\nThe Ad-Hoc Committee was mandated to probe the Oil Mining Lease granted to SPDC from 1959 to 1989, and 1989 to 2019 under the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture agreement.\n\nThe committee which was constituted by Senate President Ahmad Lawan, has Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi as its chairman.\n\nOther members on the panel include Senators George Thompson Sekibo, Abdullahi Yahaya, Bassey Albert Akpan, Olamilekan Solomon Adeola, Smart Adeyemi and Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed.\n\nAccordingly, the chamber demanded a refund of $200 million (USD) or any amount short of what was paid by SPDC, including penalties and interests under the said lease agreements to the federal government\u2019s coffers.\n\nThe resolution was reached by the chamber after it considered a motion sponsored by Senator George Thompson Sekibo (PDP, Rivers East).\n\nThe motion was entitled, \u201cnon-payment of the sum of $200,000,000 accruals from the Oil Mining Lease (OML), by Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited under the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture Agreement and, illegal and unlawful renewal of Oil Mining Leases by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) contrary to the provision of paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to the Petroleum Act 1969 (now Section 86(1) and 86(6) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2022.\u201d\n\nSekibo, in a presentation, observed that the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture (JV) agreement, in contravention of the provisions of the Petroleum Act 1969, by the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, granted to the SPDC/NNPC a 30-year Oil Mining Lease from 1959 to 1989.\n\nHe observed that doing so constituted an illegal extension of the Oil Mining Lease by 10 years in the first instance, instead of the prescribed term of 20 years, without recourse to the provisions of the Petroleum Act 1969 in paragraph 10 of the First Schedule.\n\n\u201cUpon the expiration of the initial Oil Mining Lease in 1989, SPDC/NNPC JV, was granted another 30-year Oil Mining Lease again from 1st July 1989 to 30th June, 2019, by the Ministry of Petroleum Resource/DPR instead of the 20 years lease period prescribed by the Petroleum Act, which is contrary to paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to the said Act,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nHe disclosed that in the initial additional 10-year Oil Mining Lease of 1969 to 1989 illegally granted to the SPDC/NNPC JV by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/DPR, the federal government lost from fees, taxes, rents and royalties the sum of $120, 000, 000.\n\nHe stated that in the second instance of the extra 10 years, the federal government also lost a further sum of $80,000,000, making a total of $200,000,000.\n\nSekibo noted that a loss of $200,000,000, which is equivalent to N83, 130, 000, 000 billion, could have been of great value to the economy of the nation.\n\nHe observed that the illegal action by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/DPR as regards the SPDC/NNPC JV may not be the only non-compliant grant as details of other Joint Venture agreements with: Chevron Nigeria Limited, ENI Joint Venture, EXXON Mobil Upstream JV, Total E & P Nigeria Limited JV, needed to be ascertained through a thorough investigation to verify compliance with the provisions of the extant law.\n\nthe lawmaker expressed worry that that the trend of illegal extension of Joint Venture (JV) period from 20 years to 30 years lease period without recourse to the Petroleum Act may have also applied to other Joint Venture agreements with the International Oil Companies (IOCs) and need to be investigated.\n\nSekibo informed the chamber that SPDC went to Court on the clarity of the lease period and the judgment was not in their favour as regards the additional 10-year lease period in the two instances.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the court failed to order the SPDC to pay the arrears the 20 years lease period to the tune of $200,000,000 to the Federal Government for the illegal extensions\u201d, he said.\n\nThe lawmaker further disclosed that a whistle-blower petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on the need to recover the sum of $200,000,000 from SPDC for these illegal extensions by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/DPR and to further investigate all other Joint Venture agreements that involved the aforementioned IOCs.\n\nHe noted that the power to make laws for the Federation as vested in the National Assembly by the Constitution also encompasses the power to make laws for the promotion of national prosperity and a dynamic self-reliant economy as provided in section 16(1)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.\n\nSekibo emphasised that the constitution also gives power to each House of the National Assembly to carry out appropriate investigation on observed misapplication of the laws enacted by the National Assembly, as provided in Section 88 of the Constitution.\n\nHe stated further that Section 89 of the same Constitution provides the process on how such investigation should be carried out.\n\nAccordingly, the Senate resolved to constitute an Ad-Hoc Committee to investigate the non-compliance with the Petroleum Act and the Oil Mining Lease granted to SPDC between 1959 to 1989, and 1989 to 2019 under the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture Agreement; and compel SPDC to refund to the Federal Government the sum of $200,000,000 or any amount short of what was paid, including penalties and interests under the said lease agreement.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Terrorists in the late hours of Tuesday night attacked Keke \u2018A\u2019 and Keke \u2018B\u2019 areas of New Millennium City, Chikun local government area of Kaduna state kidnapping the wife of a military officer and six other residents of the communities.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the attack started around 11pm and lasted for an hour before security operatives could come to their rescue as the gunmen shooting sporadically ransack the villages seeking victims to kidnap.\n\nA resident of the area, who does not want her name in print, said three persons were kidnapped by the bandits at Keke \u2018A\u2019. The source who is a primary school teacher, said the bandits may have targeted a big house at Keke A in their operation.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthe bandits came around 11pm. I think their main target was a house at Keke A. The house belongs to a military officer. But as the time of the attack, the officer was not at home. So, the kidnappers broke into the house and picked his (military officer\u2019s) wife.\n\n\u201cThey also kidnapped another man who is the immediate neighbour of the military officer. In fact, the neighbour was picked alongside his eight-year old daughter, but they eventually dropped the daughter when her mother was shouting on top of her voice.\n\n\u201cI think it was at that point when she started shouting loudly that they started shooting sporadically to scare away people who might think of coming to their aid. While all that was happening, another man who was just returning home in his car at that time ran into the kidnappers. He was the third person that was taken away.\u201d\n\nShe also said that, many people who were still outside of their houses including shops operators scampered to safety when the bandits started shooting.\n\n\u201cAs at this morning, we saw many shoes on the ground and we became scared that, those must be the shoes of the people kidnapped. But, one of the people who escaped the attack told us the shoes belong to those who ran away,\u201d she said.\n\nA resident of Keke \u2018B\u2019, told our Correspondent that, he returned home less than 10 minutes and was taking his shower when he started hearing gunshots. He however said that a man, his wife and their two housegirls were kidnapped in Keke \u2018B\u2019.\n\n\u201cI was so terrified when I heard the sound of gunshot.

          "text": "Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE top eighty-one (81) students have emerged from the over 12,000 students vying for a spot in the finals of the fourth edition of the InterswitchSPAK National Science Competition. These students were shortlisted following the nationwide computer-based tests (CBT) that served as a basis for preogression into the competition.\n\nInterswitchSPAK, a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative of Africa\u2019s leading integrated payments and digital commerce company, Interswitch, in its fourth year, continues to drive and reward interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).\n\nThe CBT exams were taken in two stages: the first was taken from June 2, 2022, to June 5, 2022, and the second stage on June 8, 2022, trimming the number of registered participants from 12,014 to 500 and finally to 81. These 81 students who scaled the screening process are representatives of 13 schools.\n\nSome of the schools whose students scaled through both the first and second rounds include Adedokun International School, Ota; The Ambassador College, Ota; Marist Brothers\u2019 Juniorate, Uturu, Abia; Faith Academy Canaan Land, Ota; Loyola Jesuit College, Abuja; and Mount Olive College, Anambra.\n\nOthers include Greater Tomorrow International College, Arigidi, Ondo State; Bofoat Model College, Ondo State; FUTA Staff Secondary School Akure, Ondo; Seolad International College, Ogun; Great Cornerstone International Science College, Ondo State; Apt Scholars Universal College, Ogun State; and Oritamefa Baptist Model School, Ibadan.\n\nSpeaking on the importance of InterswitchSPAK and the need to encourage and reward more students in Africa to take up STEM subjects, the Group Chief Marketing and Corporate Communications Officer, Interswitch, Cherry Eromosele, noted that Africans should play a more central role in mapping out the future of Africa.\n\nEromosele added that the continent was ripe for development at the same scale as observed in the developed world, adding that this development had been proven to be spurred by the knowledge and application of STEM.\n\nShe said, \u201cInterswitchSPAK remains an integral expression of the belief we hold at Interswitch, which is that Africa\u2019s story can be changed from the inside out. And what this means is that only through the active participation of Africans can the change we seek come about.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we leverage the InterswitchSPAK National Science Competition, now in its fourth run, to encourage young Africans to find value in STEM subjects that have been identified as drivers of economic prosperity, something that we at Interswitch have seen firsthand.\u201d\n\nSince inception, InterswitchSPAK has continued to champion the study of STEM subjects among students in Africa, as the competition has moved beyond a locally-organized initiative and has expanded to other parts of Africa such as Kenya in East Africa.\n\nThe InterswitchSPAK competition bestows on students rewards for their interest in STEM, with the first-place winner going home with N7.5 million in scholarships over a five-year period, a laptop, and monthly stipends. The second-place winner will go home with N4 million in scholarships, a laptop, and monthly stipends for a period of 3 years. The third-place winner will go home with N1 million in scholarship for a year, monthly stipends, and a laptop.\n\nLast year\u2019s winners were Jubril Dokun of Brainfield College, Salolo, Lagos State, receiving the first prize; the second-place winner was Ayanlade Jesuferanmi of Obafemi Awolowo University International School, Ile-Ife, and Omoniyi Qudus of Scholars Universal Secondary School, Ota, Ogun State, came in third place.",

          "text": "PALMA ILEYE\n\nExecutive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board, NCDMB, Engr Simbi Kesiye Wabote, has stressed that there was an urgent need for the Federal Government and other stakeholders of the oil and gas industry to intensify efforts in the promotion of quality petroleum education and development of competent manpower which would help Nigeria meet the challenges of the ongoing energy transition and expected boom in the gas sector.\n\nWabote made the emphasis while giving a key recommendation at the convocation lecture he delivered at the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, FUPRE, Effurun, Delta State, titled \u201cDefining the Value of Local Content in Petroleum Education.\u201d\n\nHe canvassed that as western nations shift their attention from oil and gas and focus on the provision of funding, manufacturing of equipment, and development of supply chain to support their renewable energy sources, it was imperative that Nigeria and other hydrocarbon-rich countries develop the requisite capacity and capability to produce and utilize their fossil fuel resources.\n\nAccording to him, the ongoing debate and the deadlines being set in respect of energy transition underscored the need to develop home-grown skill sets to develop and manage the nation\u2019s natural resources.\n\nHe also stressed that \u201cthe narrative around energy transition has further revealed the need to ensure that there is a direct link between our petroleum education and the development and utilization of our hydrocarbon resources, so we are able to deal with any outcome of the transition.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the recent enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 and the Decade of Gas initiative, Wabote pointed out that those developments would not only engender investments and utilization of the nation\u2019s estimated 600 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves but also lead to a boom in the gas sector, which would benefit discerning institutions, investors, operators, and service providers.\n\nHe added that \u201cthese scenarios require a robust petroleum education sector to ensure that our in-country skill sets are available and sufficient to support the exploration, development, production, and processing of hydrocarbon resources.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary charged educational institutions in Nigeria to prepare for the opportunities and challenges of energy transition and gas revolution by preparing robust curriculum in petroleum education with the mindset of enabling Nigerians develop and utilize our hydrocarbon resources using our home-grown technology.\n\nThe institutions should put require greater focus on development of top-notch graduates to enable the development of Nigerian hydrocarbon resources \u2013 especially gas, he canvassed.\n\nThis he further explained, \u201cwill ensure that we are not forced out from the development of hydrocarbon resources due to lack of technical capability as was the case with coal development in Enugu.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that FUPRE was an institution devoted to petroleum education and should be at the forefront of preparing our manpower needs for any outcome or impact of Energy Transition.\n\nHe agreed on the need to add renewables to the global energy mix to ensure energy security, but criticised attempts by the western world to demonize or de-marketing other energy sources as well as extracting commitments and setting unrealistic deadlines for countries to abandon fossil fuels.\n\nHe advised all nations to jealously guard their locally available sources of energy and ensure they remain in their energy mix for the benefit of their people.\n\nHe also highlighted two implications that have emerged from the rush to move the world away from fossil fuels and they include Divestment, whereby western countries shift funding away from the development of hydrocarbons towards renewable energy and Energy Shortage, which is the decline in the supply of hydrocarbons due to lack of investments and the fast pace of the shift to renewable energies.\n\nHe posited that Divestment has resulted in the emergence of indigenous companies playing major roles in exploration and production activities \u201csuch that companies like AITEO, FIRST E&P, EROTON, and others have acquired assets and are now responsible for producing about 15% of Nigeria\u2019s oil and more than 60% of domestic gas.\u201d\n\nHe however regretted that the divestment of the international oil companies and their reluctance to make further investments in oil and gas have resulted in the repatriation of capital out of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis stifles the nation\u2019s economy of the much-needed foreign exchange with funds used as loans to acquire oil and gas assets instead of being used to develop new production assets,\u201d he rued.",

They said they don\u2019t want to be on IPPIS; that IPPIS was amputating their salaries and taking off certain allowances, and so, that it is not capturing their peculiarities.\n\n\u201cSo, we now have to ask them to go back to these places, form committees with them. Education took them on the issue of 2009 agreement, which is renegotiation of their conditions of service, emolument, their remuneration allowances. Therefore, salaries, income and wages, and ministry of finance that produce the money are involved. So, they went back.\u201d\n\nThe former governor also dismissed talks that the Federal Government has a different payment table for trade unions in tertiary institutions. Ngige noted that it might be impossible to raise the payment table because other unions, even in the health sector, might kick.\n\nHe said although the Government is not afraid of handling the situation, it has to operate within the available resource.\n\nThe Labour Minister also promised that the 13-year-old ASUU challenge involving a 2009 negotiation agreement and payment platform issues are being renegotiated and will be resolved before the end of the current administration.\n\nNgige\u2019s remark is the latest from the Federal Government since the face-off with the university lecturers who had embarked on strike since February 14.\n\nThe public university teachers are seeking improved funding for the government-owned institution, and the adoption of its University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) payment platform among others.\n\nSeveral meetings between the Federal Government and the union in the past months have yielded little results. Students across the country had earlier protested against the lingering industrial action, vowing to shutdown major roads in Nigeria.",

          "text": "The United Nations (UN) has raised an alarm that 4.1 million people in the north-eastern Nigeria are at severe risk of severe food insecurity and starvation.\n\nAccording to the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Mr. Matthias Schmale to avert this $351 million was required, which he said was part of the overall request of $1.1 billion for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, that is severely under-funded at 19.6 per cent.\n\nSchmale while briefing Member States of the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday, on the needs, challenges and windows of opportunity in the north-east said: \u201cI cannot emphasise enough, we need the resources today and not tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe said as north-east Nigeria continues to face an unrelenting humanitarian crisis, 4.1 million people in region were at risk of severe food insecurity this season, noting that people in that region are already vulnerable after struggling through 12 years of conflict.\n\nHe added that in 2022, 8.4 million people would need humanitarian assistance across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, while describing the deteriorating food security and nutrition situation as an issue that requires immediate support.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis food insecurity is felt painfully across the region, especially as operations are so desperately in need of funding. In Yobe State, families have not received food assistance for up to eight months. Some people are left without food for days not knowing where their next meal will come from.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the March 2022 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9, a tool used to identify areas at risk from food insecurity and malnutrition in the Sahel and West Africa, projected that between June and September, 4.1 million people would be food insecure.\n\nAmong them, almost 600,000 people were projected to be at emergency levels (Phase 4), which was characterised by large food consumption gaps reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality.\n\nHe noted that this high-risk period, the lean season, overlaps with the rainy season, a time when children are left vulnerable from disease outbreaks, with weakened resistance if malnourished, disclosing that malnutrition among children grows increasingly dangerous in the north-east.\n\nHe said approximately, 1.74 million children under five were estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition across the north-east in 2022, and of these, over 300,000 were estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition and are at high risk of death if they do not receive urgent treatment.\n\nHe, however, said a multi-sector response plan had been put in place by the UN and humanitarian partners to provide life-saving aid and prevent a potentially catastrophic food and nutrition situation, stating that the plan required $351 million, and was part of the overall request of $1.1 billion for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, which is severely under-funded at 19.6 per cent.\n\nHe revealed that the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan aims to assist 5.5 million people in need, describing it as a two-track process, where, \u201cthe bulk of interventions focus on emergency assistance, but at same time our approach aims to lift people out of vulnerable situations and reduce humanitarian need by increasingly focusing on durable solutions and building resilience where possible.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, defended the policies being implemented by Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, saying rather than follow textbook solutions developed in the more advanced climes, which may not be suitable for Nigeria, the apex bank\u2019s head has rightly resorted to \u201cunorthodox\u201d measures in trying to resolve the country\u2019s economic challenges.\n\nIn his written responses to Bloomberg\u2019s interview questions, Buhari said the accusations against Emefiele by detractors, including being labelled as \u201cpolitical\u201d, had more to do with the methods he was deploying to try to revamp the Nigerian economy, rather than the substance of the allegations.\n\nThe president maintained that every country should have the right to choose its economic model and policies, insisting that the CBN chief is facing criticisms because he is not following traditional methods, which have failed in the past.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cBut there is a subtext to the accusations. Because the governor follows a model outside of the economic orthodoxy, he is labelled political. But the orthodoxy has proved wrong time and again.\n\n\u201cInstead, the governor is following an alternative economic model that puts people at the heart of policy. Nigeria should be free to choose its development model and how to construct our economy, so it functions for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the independence of the office of the CBN governor, given Emefiele\u2019s alleged interest in the just-concluded presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president said if there were infractions, the board of the apex bank was better placed to sanction the governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN governor is appointed by the president. But this appointment is subject to confirmation by the Nigerian Senate. Ultimately, it will be for the CBN\u2019s Board of Directors to determine whether a CBN governor\u2019s actions have fallen foul of the laws in place to ensure he can most effectively carry out his duties.\u201d\n\nA critical actor in the federal government\u2019s efforts to boost local food production, the CBN has provided loans to farmers and restricted access to foreign exchange for importers of dozens of products, actions for which it has received flaks.\n\nBut Buhari insisted that food price inflation in the country could have been worse if Emefiele had not initiated organised programmes to boost domestic production, stressing that even at that , Nigeria still does not grow enough domestically.\n\nHe pointed out that initiatives, such as the Anchor Borrower\u2019s Programme, boosted rice production to nine million metric tonnes in 2021, from around 5.4 million metric tonnes in 2015.\n\n\u201cEven in the years of drought, rice production outstripped pre-2015 levels. Imports have fallen to near zero. We are making progress,\u201d he declared.\n\nOn why he had continued to retain subsidy on petrol, the president noted that even most Western countries were currently implementing fuel subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhy would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander!\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, while the removal of subsidy may look good on paper, the impact on Nigerians would be largely negative and unbearable.\n\n\u201cWhat our Western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things,\u201d the president maintained.\n\nBuhari added that while his government had put in motion plans to remove fuel subsidy late last year, after further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\nWhile internal production for refined products would help mitigate the effect of subsidy removal, the president projected that capacity would increase markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries come on board.\n\nBuhari posited that he was winning the war against corruption, starting with the Whistleblowing Policy enacted in his first year in office, revealing that hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned within Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that the monies had now been deployed as social and welfare funds distributed directly to the poorest during the COVID-19 pandemic and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rail, and power.\n\nHe explained, \u201cAs an illustration, monetary recoveries (January-December) 2021 show that more than N152 billion has been recovered. Dollar recoveries for the year amount to over $386 million; GBP more than 1.1 million; Euro, about 157,000; Saudi Riyals about 1.7 million, some more in digital and other currencies.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Buhari had said international partners refused to return funds they held for decades to previous Nigerian administrations in the certainty they would simply be re-stolen.\n\n\u201cThey changed their approach with us because they knew my administration could be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said that his successor would inherit a far more resilient economy, thanks to investments in infrastructure and policies that he said had bolstered local production.\n\nOn security, the president reiterated that the military had recovered all territories previously held by Boko Haram, repeating his often-held position that terrorists no longer hold any territory in Nigeria while their leaders are now deceased.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cIn 2015, Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria. Today they are close to extinct as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Air Force airstrike in March.\u201d\n\nHe stated that jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations. He said these stood as testament to new trust re-built between Nigeria and its Western allies.\n\nThe Nigerian leader urged its international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and designating them as a terrorist organisation.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cMy administration is the only in Nigeria\u2019s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth. The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes.\n\n\u201cGovernors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced.\u201d\n\nHe further opined that international trade remained rigged against food security in Africa, explaining that while the European Union\u2019s policies are all rhetoric of open trade, their common agricultural policy undermines Africa\u2019s self-sufficiency and grows poverty.\n\nOn the rising spate of religion-related killings, especially regarding the question of alleged blasphemy, the president declared that no one has any right to break the law and urged Christians and Muslims to respect each other\u2019s differences.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "text": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince is to visit Turkey for the first time since the 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan will hold one-on-one talks with Mohammed bin Salman aimed at repairing damaged ties.\n\nMr Erdogan once indirectly accused the prince of ordering Saudi agents to kill Khashoggi. He denied any involvement.\n\nThe visit comes as Turkey seeks trade, investment and assistance to help it deal with a worsening economic crisis.\n\nIt has also worked to improve relations with the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel after years of tensions.\n\nPrince Mohammed meanwhile wants to end his international isolation.\n\nHe also visited Jordan and Egypt this week as part of a Middle East tour and next month will meet US President Joe Biden, who promised in 2019 to make Saudi Arabia \u201cthe pariah that they are\u201d over Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nKhashoggi, a US-based Washington Post columnist and prominent critic of Prince Mohammed, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, where he had gone to get papers needed to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz.\n\nA UN investigator concluded that he was \u201cbrutally slain\u201d by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents sent from Riyadh, and that his body was dismembered. She made that judgement after listening to purported audio recordings of conversations inside the consulate made by Turkish intelligence.\n\nWhile Mr Erdogan did not directly accuse Prince Mohammed, he claimed he knew the order to kill Khashoggi \u201ccame from the highest levels of the Saudi government\u201d.\n\nUS intelligence agencies concluded that the crown prince had approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.\n\nSaudi prosecutors blamed \u201crogue\u201d agents and said the prince had no knowledge of the operation.\n\nA year after the killing, a Saudi court found five unnamed people guilty of directly participating in the killing and handed them death sentences that were later commuted to 20-year prison terms, while three others were jailed for seven to 10 years for covering up the crime.\n\nPresident Erdogan said last week that his talks in Ankara with Prince Mohammed \u2013 who is Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader \u2013 would focus on advancing relations between the regional powers to a \u201cmuch higher level\u201d.\n\nA senior Turkish official told Reuters news agency that the visit was expected to bring \u201ca full normalisation and a restoration of the pre-crisis period\u201d, with the two leaders signing agreements on energy, economy and security.\n\nBut Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), criticised Mr Erdogan for inviting Prince Mohammed and choosing to \u201cembrace the man who ordered the killing\u201d of Khashoggi.\n\nIn April, Mr Erdogan flew to Saudi Arabia and publicly embraced the prince, as their countries began what he called a \u201cnew period of co-operation\u201d.\n\nThat visit came three weeks after a court in Istanbul stopped the trial in absentia of 26 Saudi nationals, including two of the crown prince\u2019s aides, accused over the Khashoggi murder.\n\nThe judge said the case would be handed over to judicial authorities in Saudi Arabia, which had refused to extradite the suspects.\n\nThe move was denounced as a whitewash by human rights activists and Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who vowed to continue her fight for justice.\n\nBBC",
