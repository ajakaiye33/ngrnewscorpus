          "text": "The Nigerian social media space has been aghast since the decision of the Federal Government to suspend Twitter usage in the country, as announced on Friday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed.\n\nThe decision comes after Twitter deleted a tweet by Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), in which the President evoked the bloody Nigerian Civil War of 1967\u20131970 and threatened to mete out violence to those causing insurrection in the country.\n\nIn this piece, The PUNCH has teased together a list of countries in which Twitter has either been suspended or banned.\n\n\u2022 China\n\nTwitter is officially blocked in China, however, many Chinese people find ways around the embargo in order to use the platform.\n\nMajor Chinese companies and national media, such as Huawei and CCTV, use Twitter through a government-approved Virtual Private Network.\n\nAlso, many Chinese diplomats, embassies and consulates run their accounts on Twitter.\n\n\u2022 Egypt\n\nTwitter was inaccessible in Egypt on January 25, 2011 during the 2011 Egyptian protests, an incident blamed on the government of Egypt by some news reports.\n\nAs of January 26, Twitter was still confirming that the service was blocked in Egypt. On January 27, various reports claimed that access to the entire internet from within Egypt had been shut down.\n\nOn February 2, 2011, connectivity was re-established by the four main Egyptian service providers. A week later, the heavy filtering that occurred at the height of the revolution had ended.\n\n\u2022 Uganda\n\nUganda, under President Yoweri Museveni, blocked access to social media platforms, including Twitter, just two days before its January 14 presidential and parliamentary elections.\n\nIn a January 12 letter, the Uganda Communications Commission ordered internet service providers in the country to \u201cimmediately suspend any access and use\u201d of all messaging apps and social media platforms until further notice.\n\n\u2022 Iran\n\nDuring the 2009 Iranian presidential election, the Iranian government blocked Twitter due to fear of protests being organised through the platform. In September 2013, the blocking of both Twitter and Facebook was briefly lifted without notice due to a technical error, however, within a day the sites were blocked again.\n\n\u2022 North Korea\n\nIn April 2016, North Korea started to block Twitter. Anyone who tries to access it without special permission from the North Korean government, including foreign visitors and residents, is subject to punishment.\n\n\u2022 Turkey\n\nOn March 21, 2014, access to Twitter in Turkey was temporarily blocked, after a court order. This followed earlier remarks by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who vowed to \u201cwipe out Twitter\u201d following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle.\n\nHowever, on March 27, 2014, Istanbul Anatolia 18th Criminal Court of Peace suspended the above-mentioned court order.\n\nTwitter reports that the government of Turkey accounts for more than 52% of all content removal requests worldwide.\n\n\u2022 Turkmenistan\n\nAs of 2018, foreign news and opposition websites are blocked in Turkmenistan, and international social networks such as Twitter are usually inaccessible.",

Mbaka\u2019s charity? What of those in school on his charity and those who depend on him for their daily bread and daily spiritual nourishment, what of the poor masses?\n\n\u201cThe adoration ministry is now like a sheep without a shepherd, the tension continues to heighten, as the whole country is in crisis.\u201d\n\nThe youth urged the Bishop to consider millions of people affected by the 30 days punishment given to Fr.

How do we disclose it? When do we disclose and at what time? Who will consume the information that will be disclosed and how will that information be used in a way and manner not to jeopardize the operations of the covered entities in a manner that is open, transparent and accessible.\n\n\u201cI am not able to make further comments on this because the GMD NNPC and I, and the Director of DPR, have agreed to form a nucleus, a joint committee to develop a framework that will guide our organizations, protect the interest of our country, and still provide information that will be useful to investors, citizens, civil societies and the media\u201d, he added.\n\nDr. Orji who has just been elected chair of EITI global network on contract transparency noted that his election was in recognition of the work Nigeria has done in the area of contract transparency.\n\nHe explained that the workshop for NEITI staff was for him to sell his ideas for NEITI in the next five years and to develop a five-year strategic plan for the agency.",

The suspension has the character of collective punishment and is contrary to Nigeria\u2019s international obligations. President Buhari must immediately rescind this unconstitutional suspension. We will see in court if the suspension is not rescinded within 48 hours.\u201d\n\nThe statement, read in part: \u201cSuspending Twitter in Nigeria would deny Nigerians\u2019 access to information, and disrupt the free exchange of ideas and the ability of individuals to connect with one another and associate peacefully on matters of shared concern. It would also seriously undermine the ability of Nigerians to promote transparency and accountability in the country, and to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the Nigerian authorities to guarantee the constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights of Nigerians including online.

          "text": "Ifeanyi Okowa\n\nBy Festus Ahon, Asaba\n\nDelta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, Friday, expressed worry over irregular and human trafficking and restated the resolve of his administration to partner with the Lutheran Church of Christ and other faith-based organisations in the fight against it.\n\nOkowa who spoke when he received the Archbishop of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria and President of the Lutheran World Federation, Archbishop Musa Panti, and his delegation at Government House, Asaba, said: \u201cWe are in very troubled times in our nation and it requires the church to play its role of praying and ensuring that through our prayers and relationship with God to impact on our nation and I believe that it is the easiest route to achieving peace in this nation\u201d.\n\nNoting that the Church was a worthy partner in fight against the scourge as it was in a position to preach the gospel and change the mindset of the young ones in the society, he commended the Lutheran Church for its Symbols of Hope Project in Nigeria which had been dedicated to creating awareness against illegal migration and human trafficking in the country.\n\nALSO READ: Nigerians in Italy slam critics of passport issuance process, Immigration boss\n\nOkowa maintained that the voice of the church is more likely to be better heard than the voice of the government in such issues, because the church has the capacity to be able to school the heart far better than the government will do, adding that \u201cthe people are more likely going to trust the voice of the church even more than that of the government.\n\n\u201cThe voices of our elders and leaders in the church has a lot to do in trying to calm nerves that have been challenged. Its very exciting for me because when the church goes beyond its natural role of preaching the gospel to begin to give hope to the people, it gives hope to humanity.\n\n\u201cSometimes it is not just enough to preach the gospel but in impacting lives in several other ways will continue to attract people to the church of God. We are glad that you are giving hope to our young ones by your effort in addressing the scourge of illegal migration and human trafficking in this country. Its quite a major problem and Delta is fully involved in this fight.\n\n\u201cBy coming down here to help encourage youths to stop and to help assist those who have returned back to our country from their sojourn elsewhere outside the country actually gives hope to us and we are glad about it.\n\n\u201cAm glad to learn that beyond the fact that you have talked to them to enable them know that there is hope in Christ, you are also impacting on them by training and empowering twenty of the returnees in this state. It gives us a lot of joy and and I truly thank you for this and I hope that this impact will encourage us in even government to do more in that direction\u201d.\n\nOn the state of the country, Okowa said there was a lot of bitternes, hate and anger in the land because there is hunger, unemployment, uncertainty and a lot of insecurity.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe that the words you have spoken concerning those of us in governance is right, because we need to do more and ensure that we reach out more to our people, we need ensure that we put processes in place that will continue to give hope our people.\n\n\u201cIt is quite challenging at the moment, we may have gotten certain things wrong but when do realise that we have gotten certain things wrong then we need to begin to reright the wrong and believe that starting from the Federal government to the state governments.\n\nALSO READ: Police arrests native doctor, parades 108 others in Calabar\n\n\u201cFor government to be impactful on the people there is the need to ensure there is fairness, justice, equity and as Nigerians that we all see ourselves as one.\n\n\u201cWe must give hope to every part of Nigeria and we must ensure that there is inclusiveness in governance and we must ensure that in whatever we are doing we do it in the best interest of this country.\n\n\u201cI believe that as we continue to tow the path of justice and fairness, we will begin to rebuild the hope in our people and the commitment with our people to governance process.\n\n\u201cThis is important because if we are in government and the people lose trust in us it will be a greater problem for us in the governance process and so we must continue to preach peace and to find ways to partner together to be able to get out of this situation that we have found ourselves.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The announcement by the Federal Government that it has indefinitely suspended operations of microblogging and social networking service, Twitter has sparked outrage.\n\nThe Nation reports the ban came after twitter deleted a controversial post by President Muhammadu Buhari referencing the civil war, and threatening to treat arsonists, agitators \u201cwith the language they understand\u201d on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d Buhari tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced suspension of Twitter operations, citing alleged use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nReacting, many Nigerians expressed dissatisfaction and outrage over the government\u2019s decision describing it as \u201cdictatorial\u201d\n\nSome other Nigerians suggested to users to download VPNs to be able to bypass the restrictions so as to access the microblogging website.\n\nActivist Laywer Festus Ogun argued: \u201cBanning @Twitter violates S. 22 & 39 of the 1999 Constitution. Twitter seems to be the only medium through which we hold the reckless regime of Buhari responsible. We will resist the attempts to ban Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar in terse post said, \u201cHopefully, this isn\u2019t my last tweet. #smile.\u201d\n\nCitizen Gazel said: \u201cWe strongly condemn the actions of the FG as violating the right to expression and we advise all Nigerians to download VPNs.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are discussing with partners to develop most effective legal strategies in this time. #ResistDictatorship #ShrinkingSpace\u201d\n\nPopular blogger Japhet Omojuwa said: \u201cIf Twitter weren\u2019t certain about their choice of Ghana over Nigeria, the latest joke of a Twitter operational ban \u2013 see last tweet \u2013 is more than enough justification.\n\n\u201cThis is 2021, but you could have sworn we were back in 1998.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cWe\u2019re suing Nigerian authorities over their ILLEGAL indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way. @NigeriaGov, we\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nCleric Apostle Suleiman said: \u201cThey are banning Twitter in Nigeria. And they announced it on Twitter.\u201d\n\nAnother User @Letter_to_jack lamented saying, \u201cBuhari and APC campaigned vigorously on twitter in the run-in to the elections in 2015.\n\n\u201cToday they have suspended twitter in Nigeria. We went from frying pan straight into the fire.\u201d\n\nDr. Dipo Awojide queried: \u201cDoes President Buhari and the federal government know how much young Nigerians make on social media platforms like Twitter daily?\n\n\u201cDoes Lai Mohammed know the number of jobs being sustained by Twitter in Nigeria? What is wrong with these people?\u2019\u2019\n\nAmnesty Nigeria said: \u201cAmnesty International condemns the Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of Twitter Twitter in #Nigeria \u2014 a social media widely used by Nigerians to exercise their human rights, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information. #TwitterBan.\u201d",

          "text": "From Obinna Odogwu, Awka\n\nTragedy struck in Awka, the Anambra State capital on Friday when a truck loaded with cattle lost its brakes and crashed at Kwata Flyover, killing many people and roasting many cattle.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the truck lost its brakes while descending the hilly Aroma Junction on the Enugu \u2013 Onitsha Expressway.\n\nThey said that the long vehicle raced past the ever busy UNIZIK Junction and crashed on many vehicles waiting for the traffic light to signal them to move with green lights.\n\nAlthough there were conflicting accounts on how the truck went up in flames, sources said that it sparked fire instantly, roasting many of the cattle it carried. They said that more than 10 persons including hawkers were killed.\n\nThe exact number of the deceased could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report; and the number of vehicles involved as security agents scared sympathizers and onlookers away with gunshots; firing live bullets in different directions.\n\nIn fact, there was a pandemonium when the security agents including the military and the police opened gunfire, perhaps, in attempts to disperse the surging onlookers and sympathizers who had throng the accident scene.\n\nVehicles using a section of the road were seen racing on high speed to avoid being hit by bullets even as pedestrians ran helter-skelter, scampering for safety.\n\nPolicemen on the scene, however, told the reporter that about 10 vehicles were affected. They, however, asked the reporter to leave the scene immediately to avoid being hit by the live bullets.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), in a statement by its Public Education Officer in the state, SRC Florence Edor, said that only two persons were killed.\n\n\u201cTwo male adults lost their lives in a multiple fatal crash at about 1428hrs this afternoon near Kwata Bridge opposite the Ministry of Agriculture, Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIt involves a red Man Diesel truck with registration number JJN 59 YZ, a green Honda CRV without enlistment number, a Red M/Benz 4matic with registration number ABJ 115 DA, a black Toyota Highlander with registration number AWKA 226 HM and an Ash Lexus SUV with registration number KJA 136 FD.\n\n\u201cEyewitness report reaching us indicates that the crash which was as a result of brake failure involved a total of 12 people, 11 Male adults and one female adult .\n\n\u201cOne male adult who sustained injury was rushed to Princeton Hospital by FRSC rescue team from Awka, while the other two male adults, who were taken to Amaku General Hospital Awka, were later confirmed dead by the doctors on duty and their bodies deposited at the hospital morgue\u201d, the statement read.",

          "text": "\u2022Insecurity does not make Nigeria failed state, insists FG\n\n\u2022Presidency: Foreign magazine\u2019s opinion on Nigeria distorted, unfair\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Kayode Fasua in Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday expressed worry over the state of the nation and blamed bad leadership for the nation\u2019s woes.\n\nThe former president, while receiving a book titled, \u2018The Man, The General and The President,\u2019 written by Femmy Carrena, said in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, that even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.\n\nAccording to him, the country is currently dripping with bitterness and sadness.\n\nBut despite the worsening insecurity, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state on the basis of the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) also said alleged plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would fail.\n\nObasanjo stated that although Nigeria is destined to lead the black race, failure of leadership has prevented the country from taking its rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be \u2013 a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative; we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?\u201d\n\nHe stated that over 14 million children were out of school, adding that if care is not taken, Nigeria would have more \u201cBoko Haram in future.\u201d\n\nObasanjo urged Nigerians to emulate some prominent citizens that are doing well at the international level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries); we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the WTO (World Trade Organisation), and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or the day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU (African Union), Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well? Something must be wrong! We should be interrogating this; we should ask then what should we do?\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nThe book was reviewed by Professor Emeritus, Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the review was read on his behalf by Ndidi Amaka-Okafor.\n\nInsecurity Does Not Make Nigeria Failed State, Insists FG\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state due to the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this yesterday in response to a recent declaration by the Council on Foreign Affairs in the United States that \u201cNigeria is at a point of no return with all the signs of a failed nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Mr. Robert Rotberg, had urged the United States to acknowledge that Nigeria is a failed state in the light of the many challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s worldwide companions, particularly the USA, should acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that truth, they need to deepen their engagement with the nation and search to carry the present administration accountable for its failures, while additionally working with it to supply safety and proper financial system,\u201d they had said in an article.\n\nBut Mohammed said in Abuja that \u201cNigeria is not and cannot be a failed state.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the declaration by the council did not represent an official US policy.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis declaration is merely the opinions of two persons, former US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Robert Rotberg.\n\n\u201cDeclaring any nation a failed state is not done at the whims and caprices of one or two persons, no matter their status.\n\n\u201cJust because Nigeria is facing security challenges, which we have acknowledged and which we are tackling, does not automatically make the country a failed state.\n\n\u201cLike former US Senator Daniel Moynihan said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion but not your facts.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigeria did not meet the criteria for a nation to become a failed state.\n\nHe listed the criteria to include the inability to provide public service and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.\n\n\u201cYes, the non-state actors may be rampaging in some parts of the country; they have not and cannot overwhelm this government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said it was not the first time it was predicted that Nigeria would fail or break up.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were even once told that Nigeria would break up in 2015. But their doomsday predictions have all failed and will fail again.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresidency: Foreign Magazine\u2019s Opinion on Nigeria Distorted, Unfair\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency yesterday described as unfair and distorted an opinion in the latest article on Nigeria entitled \u2018The Giant of Africa Is Failing\u2019 published by the Foreign Affairs (Magazine).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, made the condemnation in a reaction to the article.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the publishers of the magazine, the presidential spokesman took exception to the way and manner facts were being misrepresented to support distorted opinions.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cThe latest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\n\n\u201cFormer United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\n\u201cThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies.\n\n\u201cIt is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u2019\n\nPlots to Destroy Buhari\u2019s Govt will Fail, Says APC\n\nAlso yesterday, the ruling APC said plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of Buhari would fail.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, in Abuja, that despite the challenges the party met on the ground, the president had recorded successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty.\n\nAkpanudoedehe spoke on behalf of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail; some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible.\n\nAccording to him, the SIM card registration, which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered sims available for use for criminal purposes has helped in improving the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThose who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria\u2019s poor and the vulnerable were being underreported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party member nor did they share in the administration\u2019s vision.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Kingsley Nwezeh\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday allayed concerns about possible mass retirement of top military officers superior to the Chief of Army, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya.\n\nIt said contrary to reports of an impending exodus of about 30 Generals in the military following the appointment of Yahaya, a member of the 37 Regular Course of Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), other major generals and equivalent ranks in the military senior to him would be redeployed to the Defence Headquarters.\n\nIn line with military tradition that forbids seniors saluting juniors, members of Course 35, 36 and 37 were expected to leave the service following Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that members of Course 35, notably the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP), Maj. Gen. Benjamin Ahanotu, and Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Maj. Gen. Abubakar Maikobi, have not been seen at official functions since Yahaya assumed duties.\n\nAhanotu\u2019s deputy has been standing in for him at official functions.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that most Course 36 officers were redeployed to Defence Headquarters and tri-service institutions, notably Armed Forces Resettlement Centre, Command and Staff College, Jaji and TRADOC and have since assumed duties.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, is of Course 34, whom by his seniority could accommodate officers of Courses 35 and 36 cadres in tri-service institutions under the DHQ.\n\nThe new army chief is believed to have accepted to work with his coursemates (Course 37).\n\nBriefing the media in Abuja yesterday, Acting Director of the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Bri. Gen.\n\nBernard Onyeuko, said the military was not contemplating any retirement and had, in fact, not retired any general.\n\n\u201cI wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours. Retirement is only voluntarily for senior officers who desire to do so,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAt this point, no retirement has been authorised by the military high command.\u201d\n\nHe said the military high command would not be weary of appreciating the general public for their support and continue to encourage them to provide credible and timely information that will facilitate their proactive engagements in the theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cThe military high command also lauds all efforts of the gallant troops of the armed forces and personnel of other security agencies involved in various operations across the country for their resilience and indefatigable commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko also reviewed DDMO\u2019s operational activities nationwide between May 20 and June 2.\n\nHe said the operations were the combined efforts of the military and other security agencies involving land, maritime and air operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is worthy of note that these operations are conducted simultaneously in the various theatres of operation on daily basis across the country. The unrelenting and committed efforts of the gallant troops as well as the cumulative results of our operational activities in the various operations and specific events will be highlighted under the different operations.\n\n\u201cWithin the period in focus, troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria intensified their operational efforts in the fight against terrorism, banditry, hoodlums and militancy as well as other criminalities across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d According to him, the troops conducted series of clearance patrols, ambush, raid, picketing, cordon and search operations as well as artillery bombardments.\n\nOthers are anti-piracy, anti-illegal oil bunkering, anti-crude oil theft, anti-pipeline vandalism and anti-smuggling operations. He said there were also extensive air operations, which included air patrols, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions, offensive air strikes, air interdictions, search and rescue operations, and close air support for ground troops.\n\nHe said troops of Operation Hadin Kai carried out series of operational activities.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey rescued kidnapped victims, neutralised scores of terrorists, destroyed terrorists\u2019 enclaves, arrested terrorists and intercepted terrorists\u2019 logistics items, including vehicles.\n\n\u201cOn 20 May 2021, troops had contact and engaged BHT criminal elements in Gwoza LGA of Borno State. This occurred as troops swiftly responded to a distress call by farmers on an attack on their location. Troops gallantly rescued the farmers. During the encounter, several terrorists were neutralised, while some others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Protests Deletion of Tweet, Says Twitter Can\u2019t Gag Buhari",
          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me.

          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The suspended Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Mr Abidemi Rufai, caught in $350,000 wire fraud, may forfeit his bail as the United State authorities said he would escape to Nigeria if granted bail and his extradition would be difficult.\n\nThe Acting US Attorney, Tessa Gorma, stated this while asking a district judge to reverse a bail earlier granted to Rufai by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe authorities argued that Rufai presents an extreme risk of flight and \u201cif he does escape to Nigeria, extradition will be extraordinarily difficult or impossible because of his ties to the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well known that extradition from Nigeria to the United States is difficult under the best of circumstances. That will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment,\u201d Gorma said.\n\nDespite his alleged involvement in $350,000 fraud, Rufai said through his lawyer that he was a man of integrity.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s appeal on why he should be released on bail, his lawyer, Lance Hester, told the court in Tacoma that his client has a good character, which facilitated his appointment as governor\u2019s aide.\n\nThe reply was filed on June 1, 2021.

The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account.

          "text": "\u201cWhat does it take to create Unicorns in Africa?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the journey started with this question. Back then, eCommerce giant Jumia, South Africa\u2019s Promasidor Holdings and Cell C were the only Unicorns from Africa.\n\nToday, the story is different, there are five unicorns in Africa.\n\nCoined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, a unicorn is any private startup company started after 2003 that is valued at more than $1 billion. Lee chose the magic valuation number of $1 billion because it suggests that a company has either disrupted the market or created a new market.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase in the number of unicorns in Africa might seem like progress. It\u2019s only a small fraction of the number of unicorns in the world and in other countries.\n\nAccording to CBInsights, as of May 2021, there were more than 600 unicorns around the world. India has about 100 unicorns, China has 162 unicorns while the US has almost 300 unicorns.\n\nMost unicorns come from outside the African continent because the startup scene in Africa is still growing.\n\nTo accelerate this growth, in 2017, Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment company, set out to create a systematic approach to discover and produce unicorns on the continent. The unicorn team is led by Dr Akintoye Akindele with support from members like Dr Wura Abiola, Kola Abiola, Olatutu Sholeye, Yomi Akapo, Prof Cesar Baena, Mark White, Akudo Nweke, Kunle Soriyan and Dr Ponmile Osibo. The team travelled around the world studying different tech ecosystems to learn about what makes a unicorn and to create a playbook for the African tech ecosystem.\n\nThe wife of the Lagos state governor, Joke Sanwo-Olu at the event\n\nOn the 2nd of June, 2021 Unicorn Group held an event for the official launch of its Lagos campus. A number of distinguished dignitaries were present.\n\nTimipre Sylva Minister of State for Petroleum Resources; Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu represented by his wife Joke Sanwo-Olu; Engr Simbi Wabote Exec. sec. Nigerian Content Development monitoring board and Mr Osh Agabi CEO Koniku. The vice-chancellors of Lagos State University and Obafemi Awolowo University, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and Prof Eyitope Ogunbodede, respectively, were also in attendance.\n\nA group picture of the invited dignitaries\n\nUnicorn Group\u2019s ecosystem approach\n\nAt this event, the Unicorn Group shared its multifaceted approach to creating more unicorns in Africa.\n\nThis approach is made up of programs developed for startups and early-stage companies, campuses built across Africa to bridge the gap of inadequate infrastructure, advisers for the startups and partnerships with leading global organisations.\n\nThe five-step program caters to businesses at any stage. The first step is the Idea Lab, a program targeted at people with business ideas. The Idea Lab will run for a maximum of six months.\n\nThe Hub program is the second step, it\u2019s for businesses with a viable product. It\u2019ll run for a maximum of 12 months.\n\nThe third step is the incubator program for businesses with existing commercial products with market acceptance. It\u2019ll run for a maximum duration of two years.\n\nThe fourth and fifth programs are the Accelerator and the growth & scale program which are designed for established and profitable businesses.\n\nThe programs would run concurrently. Intentionally, its Lagos campus which is housed in a five story building is built in such a way that each floor caters for each step of the program.\n\nDr Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Unicorn Group\n\nUnicorn Group has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg and Accra. A fifth campus in Marrakesh is slated to open in 2022.\n\nWhat sets the Unicorn Group\u2019s approach apart from others? Ponmile Osibo, Chief investor relations officer told TechCabal, that for the Unicorn Group, it\u2019s beyond investing just money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to give someone money and it disappears. We\u2019ve come to understand that companies need access to a wide range of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then in 2017, there was no path to becoming a unicorn. There are different types of business models. There are businesses that should monetize from the get go and those who should gain traction first before monetization. There\u2019s no African playbook for this.\u201d\n\nFor any investment company, the end goal is to get a good return on investment (ROI). The investment in creating five campuses amongst other things is an enormous upfront provision of capital. I asked Osibo how they plan to recoup its investment.\n\n\u201cAt some stages, we collect equity in exchange for the capital and support we give these companies but for us, it\u2019s even bigger than that,\u201d He said.\n\nThe bigger picture for the Unicorn Group is the impact it\u2019ll have on the economy. He said, \u201cThink about it, we\u2019ve found out that the average small business hires five people. If we\u2019re able to empower about 200,000 businesses that\u2019s a minimum of 1 million additional jobs that won\u2019t have existed. Think of the ripple effect on the economy.\u201d",

There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be indefinitely blocking access to microblogging and social media platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Information and Culture made this move known on its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n\n\nFG Suspends @Twitter Operations in Nigeria pic.twitter.com/7z5BQ0Mi3U \u2014 Fed Min of Info & Cu (@FMICNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nPer the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, the government made this suspension due to the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis move comes just a few days after Twitter deleted a controversial tweet made by Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says it\u2019s been a real struggle getting the app to function properly across devices.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, on June 3, 2021, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we\u2019ve solved this and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it out soon!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s coming to the app. The CEO also revealed a \u2018view once\u2019 feature which will let users send pictures and videos that disappear after they have been viewed.\n\nWhen are these features coming? Though there is no launch date for these features, Zuckerberg hints at some time within the next two months.\n\nTesla for Africa might be getting closer\n\nBe it self-driving or battery-powered, bringing an electric vehicle to African roads is a challenge for obvious reasons: the state of the roads and a lack of electricity. But some local entrepreneurs have not only actualised this but incorporated the continent\u2019s flair.\n\nFrom electric delivery tricycles used by Kibanda to Siltech\u2019s electric bikes and Jet Motor Company\u2019s cars, an African Tesla could be closer than we think.\n\nTechpoint Africa visited Tolulope Williams, a legal practitioner turned EV engineer, and he detailed his story on how a love for motorbikes gave birth to an EV assembly company.\n\nRead his engaging discussion with our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter launches premium subscription service\n\nTwitter launched its premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, on June 3, 2021. According to the company\u2019s blog, the service is geared towards frequent users who desire a better experience on the platform.\n\nThe service provides \u201caccess to exclusive features and perks that will take their experience on Twitter to the next level.\u201d\n\nTwitter will roll out the payment service in Australia and Canada to get feedback, and users who subscribe to the service will get features such as Undo Tweet, Bookmark Folders, and Reader Mode.\n\nHow much will it cost?

          "text": "Kibanda TopUp, a Kenyan startup which aims at digitising the food supply chain for micro, small, and medium restaurants in Africa has closed a $460k pre-seed round to increase its customer base.\n\nThe round was led by US-based JAM Fund, with the participation of mPharma\u2019s CEO, Gregory Rockson; Flutterwave\u2019s CEO, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Alarko Ventures\u2019 Managing Partner, Cem Garih; and several angel investors.\n\nThe involvement of local investors like Rockson and Agboola continues a growing trend of African investment in early-stage startups.\n\nLaunched in February 2021 by Co-founders, Njavwa Mutambo and Emilie Blauwhoff, Kibanda delivers goods directly to restaurants via electric tricycles assembled in Nairobi by its partner, ARC Ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCustomers can order inventory such as grains, beverages, poultry, and beef via app or SMS and receive their order the next day.\n\nSince launch, the startup has reportedly served 130 restaurants \u2014 announcing restaurant 100 on May 31, 2021 \u2014 and plans to use the funding to hire critical team members in engineering and supply chain who will enable fast growth and development of additional products.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Tony Elumelu Foundation of which he is an alumnus, Mutambo revealed plans to expand to Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe are increasing restaurants\u2019 contributions to Africa\u2019s GDP by helping reduce cost with the supply chain. We are doubling down on our efforts in Kenya and our next location is Lagos \u2013 the reason being that we have to be where the majority of restaurants are, and Nigeria has a large number of these informal restaurants.\u201d says Mutambo\n\nKibanda faces the problem of solving issues around logistics and transport. To address the challenge of transportation costs, the company uses electric tricycles Kenya leading to a reduction in cost by 25%.\n\nWith plans to expand into other countries, this might pose a challenge of scalability especially in countries where it might not be able to use this to its advantage.\n\nMutambo is an experienced hand in the logistics space having served as CEO of Musanga Logistics \u2014 a Zambia-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform connecting shippers and carriers in real time \u2014 and Global Lead for Product Operations at Lori Systems \u2014 an e-logistics company in Kenya.\n\nBased on Blauwhoff\u2019s skills in entrepreneurial digital strategy and project management, and Mutambo\u2019s experience in logistics, Rockson expresses confidence in the founders\u2019 vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLocal informal restaurants are the heart of social commerce in African neighbourhoods. Kibanda TopUp has a great opportunity to drive a transformation of these businesses into a formal restaurant cooperative to maximise the economic potential. I am excited about the team behind this journey as they have the right experience and intent to build a huge business,\u201d says Rockson",

          "text": "Its first flight is days away yet Green Africa, the Lagos-based startup budget airline, is edging closer to disrupting the Nigerian airspace forever. It has announced its entrance with cheaper airfares for seven routes including Lagos to Abuja, a strategy that looks well suited to a large country where average incomes are low and rising insecurity is increasingly discouraging road travel.\n\nGreen Africa\u2019s strategy is not new, at least not on the global scene. It has a similar playbook to the world\u2019s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines. Southwest, despite being a low-cost carrier has been able to stay profitable through many decades. It even has an economic term named after it popularly called \u201cthe Southwest effect\u201d.\n\nSouthwest started out with an idea to make air travel accessible for all. While most carriers in the U.S. focused on wealthy travelers, it set out to disrupt the market by giving more people the opportunity to travel by air at a low cost.\n\nSouthwest Airlines focused on four main things: a low-cost structure that stayed low due to fast growth, happy employees who liked their jobs and translated that to customers, being future-minded, and differentiated.\n\nGreen Africa, just like Southwest, is coming into the Nigerian aviation sector with a low-cost structure with fares between N16,500 and N23,000, which is about a 50 to 70 percent slash in average fares charged by other airlines. Although, there have been questions as to whether the prices will remain low.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa completes acceptance of 3 ATR 72-600s in preparation for deployment\n\n\u201cI would not say the price they have started with will be permanent, it is an introductory offer but you can be sure that of you pick the first three airline in the country with the lowest fare in two or three months, Green Africa would be one of them\u201d Olumide Ohunayo, a member of the Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) said.\n\n\u201cThey have started with a very low-cost aircraft, they are taking a smaller market that fits the Nigerian market and if they build on that and get good maintenance organisations, continue with the same fleet, get better deals with the manufacturer of such aircraft, the maintenance and cost of operation would go lower, their fare will definitely not increase.\u201d Ohunayo said.\n\nDespite the similarity in low fares, differences such as fleet and routes make Green Africa different from Southwest.\n\nGreen Africa will use ATR72-600S jetliners, a turboprop, while Southwest operates Boeing 737 jet planes. Turboprops are generally more fuel-efficient than jets whose fuel usage is higher.\n\nA BusinessDay analysis shows that for a one-way trip, a jet aircraft\u2019s flight from Lagos to Abuja consumes nothing less than 8,000 litres and at N220/litre, airlines pay about N1.76 million for fuel alone.\n\nA turboprop consumes about 58-100 gallons of fuel per hour compared to a jet aircraft which consumes about 77-239 gallons of fuel every hour, according to SherapReport. This means on average, turboprop\u2019s fuel consumption is about 155 percent lesser than jet aircraft, which helps Green Africa save costs.\n\nEight years ago, Southwest expanded its routes to 14 countries outside the US after it gained more domestic passengers than any US airline. For now, Green Africa will fly to seven domestic destinations from Lagos, including Akure, Ilorin, Abuja, Owerri, Port Harcourt and Enugu.\n\nUnlike full-service carriers, Southwest has all its activities tailored towards low-cost delivery. No meals are served, no seats assigned, or any premium class service.\n\nThe Nigerian market is dominated by full-service carriers; low-cost airlines like Southwest are uncommon. It is this niche Green Africa wants to fill.\n\n\u201cWe are crafting a network plan that will afford customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends,\u201d Babawande Afolabi, the CEO of Green Africa said during the announcement that the airline was commencing operations.\n\nUnsafe roads make Nigerians take to the air\n\nGreen Africa is offering cheap airfares at a time when Nigerians are afraid to travel by road given the rise in the number of kidnap cases on road trips.\n\nRising insecurity on Nigerian roads showed up in data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which reported a decline of 23.75 percent in Road Transport GDP in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter.\n\nPR24 Nigeria Limited, a private security agency released a recent travel advisory report to highlight areas that are currently unsafe and no state in Nigeria was classified as safe.\n\nOf the 36 states, 14 were classified as high-risk regions; 3 (Adamawa, Borno and Yobe) were classified as dangerous while 19 were in the medium-risk group.\n\nOwerri and Enugu, two of the routes Green Africa plans to ply, were classified as high-risk regions which means only essential travel should be made to these states. For regions classified as medium risk travel security is advised when traveling to those areas.\n\nFriendly prices for infrequent flyers\n\nNigerians travel a lot; after food, Nigerians spend the most on transportation.\n\nAccording to the 2019 consumption expenditure by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the total household expenditure on food and non-food items was N40 trillion.\n\nMore than half of this was spent on food while 43.3 percent was spent on non-food items. In the non-food category, 6.4 percent was spent on transportation, followed by health, education and services with 6.1 percent, 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.\n\nWith the insecurity, air transport has become the preferred travel option for Nigerians, for those who can afford it.\n\nData from the NBS also show that on average, bus journeys within cities have increased 72 percent to N3,861 in April 2021 compared to N2,237 recorded in April 2020.\n\nAirfare cost also averaged N36,409 in April 2021, this is an 18.43 percent increase compared to N30,743 recorded in the same period last year, according to data from the NBS.\n\nTransportation costs are increasing at a time when 40 percent of the population is classified as poor. This means an average of four out of 10 individuals in Nigeria live below $1.90 (N780) per day.\n\nNigeria has the second-highest unemployment rate in the world after Namibia at 33.3 percent. With inflation at 18.12 percent and food inflation is also at 22.7 percent, Nigerians are having a hard time affording food and other basic necessities.\n\nAlthough Green Africa only covers seven domestic destinations for now its promise to charge airfare as low as 16,500, makes air travel attractive for more Nigerians.",

There\u2019s no explanation of how the cash-strapped state firm will pay. The NNPC says its vision is to boost the domestic refining capacity and to become a net exporter of petroleum products.\n\nNigeria\u2019s partly private fuel-import system had long been riddled with patronage and corruption. Fuel was imported only to be smuggled to neighboring states, and labor unions and civic groups accused the government of making billions of dollars of illegal payments for fuel subsidies. Idled government refineries served that system well.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria can forget million-dollar oil tax revenues as energy transition nears\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s record at managing its own refineries speaks for itself \u2014 none of them have worked in years,\u201d said Antony Goldman, founder of Promedia Consulting, a political risk advisory firm. \u201cThis is just how a small, but influential network of traders likes it.\u201d\n\nWhile the NNPC may not be looking to control the plants, its influence would still be outsized. It\u2019s likely to be relied upon for crude, and the government is responsible for permits and rules that need to be adhered to for a private business to succeed.\n\nSince stakes weren\u2019t in the draft reform bill sent by the presidency to the National Assembly, the NNPC\u2019s proposal may not come to pass. Still, the move raises the whiff of interference from entrenched \u201clobbies seeking to dilute the reform process,\u201d Goldman says.\n\nWhile the NNPC says it wants to turn Nigeria into a fuel-products exporter, it hasn\u2019t demonstrated the capability to do so.

The Senate therefore deemed it important to create avenues for the involvement of the public\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur country has been consistently reminded that there are flaws in our constitution. There is a deep concern among legislators and other stakeholders, just as there are divergent opinions on what we should do to remedy it\u201d.\n\nLawan also noted that, \u201cthere are broad-ranging agitations and constitutional amendment proposals for devolving more powers to subnational governments, for resource control, greater representation and participation of women in governance and public life, return to the regional system of the post-independence era, creation of additional states and Local Government, enhanced residency and indigene rights, decentralized policing, and Local government autonomy, amongst others\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile we have identified certain items as thematic areas, we are still open to engagement on any other relevant proposal and we look forward to continuing discussions with stakeholders on all proposals in that regard\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is important to similarly note that agitations are democratic expressions and indications of dissatisfaction with our extant Constitution. Honestly engaging with each other, amid a good faith, is the best way forward\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly plays the underlying role of participatory democracy to replace representative democracy, but to supplement it and make it function better. Therefore, there are no preconceived decisions on the outcome of the process. The final product will be shaped by the voices of citizens as harnessed from the hearings.\n\n\u201cRegardless, the constitution review alone will not engender a successful democracy, without a concomitant shift in attitude and political will. It has to be backed by the requisite political will and the right attitude. Democracy demands the highest qualities of self-discipline, restraint, empathy, and the willingness to commit, concede and sacrifice for the general good\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has charged the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) to be more participatory and identify the most feasible means to utilize the N12 trillion available to the commission in developing the country\u2019s real economy.\n\nThe governor gave the charge when he received officials of PENCOM, led by its Commissioner for Finance, Mr. Charles Sylvester Emukowhate, on a courtesy visit at the Government House, in Benin City.\n\nObaseki noted: \u201cOne thing that the commission must now focus on is participation. There is no need to have N12 trillion sitting in banks and not helping to activate the economy. I believe it\u2019s time for the Commission to get a lot more participatory. Yes, it\u2019s the people\u2019s fund and must be accounted for and provided, when needed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep the money in banks and make the banks happy. We need to grow the economy. We have talked on how to utilize and channel funds to the real economy over the years, but it has not happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese funds should be channeled into the economy to build infrastructure and grow the economy,\u201d he added.\n\nReaffirming his administration\u2019s commitment to the welfare of workers and pensioners in the state, the governor noted, \u201cI am glad that we started the Contributory Pension Scheme in 2017 and now Edo State workers have seen the benefits of the scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of the scheme in 2017, benefits have been paid to the families of all those covered by the insurance scheme,\u201d he revealed.\n\nThe governor said his administration is undertaking an audit of the 18 Local Government Areas, adding, \u201cFor us, sustainability is key. We don\u2019t want to start something and stop it half way.\n\n\u201cWe need more sensitization on the Scheme to ensure it is accepted and appreciated totally. The local government is another tier of government that we don\u2019t have direct control over because they are independent. We don\u2019t keep their money, but can persuade and encourage; these we have tried in the past.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cThe wage bill for pensioners in the state is quite heavy on the government. We are currently paying a huge sum in terms of pension payment. It\u2019s almost 50 per cent of our regular salary payment.\n\n\u201cFor us, the welfare of our civil servants is critical to us; that is why you will not see me with a long convoy. Instead, I will use that money to better the lives of Edo people and not use it to benefit some godfather. Thank God, we have victory in that area.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Emukowhate said the mandate of the PENCOM is to ensure that the lives of pensioners are made comfortable after retirement from service.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe commend you for embracing the process and enacting the Edo State Pension Reforms laws, commencing the implementation of CPS in 2017, setting up the Pension Bureau Board, registering employees with Pension fund administrators and remitting 10 per cent employers and 8 per cent employees contributions to the CPS, even as employers\u2019 verification exercise is ongoing.\n\n\u201cEdo State has a valid group life insurance. With these steps you have shown the people of the State that you are a governor who cares for them.\u201d\n\n...",

This approach is transparent and will ensure the amount remains the same, regardless of the number of sessions per transaction,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cTo promote transparency in its administration, the new USSD charges will be collected on behalf of MNOs directly from customers bank accounts. Banks shall not impose additional charges on customers for use of the USSD channel.\n\n\u201cA settlement plan for outstanding payments incurred for USSD services, previously rendered by the MNOs, is being worked out by all parties in a bid to ensure that the matter is fully resolved.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, MTN Nigeria also confirmed the implementation of the plan, saying the deductions will commence on June 3.\n\n\u201cEffective 3rd June, 2021, each USSD Banking transaction will attract a charge of N6.98 exclusive of VAT for use of the USSD Banking channel. The money will be deducted from your bank, by your bank,\u201d the teleco tweeted in response to an inquiry.\n\nIkechukwu Adinde, director of public affairs at Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC), told The Cable that said the policy is not new, and it ought to have been implemented in March 2021.\n\n\u201cIf banks delayed it and they are just implementation the policy, fine,\u201d Adinde said.\n\n\u201cThe March joint statement between the CBN and NCC clearly state positions on the matter.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari will on Thursday, June 10, perform the official launch of the assets under the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, also known as the Deep Blue Project in Lagos.\n\nPreparatory to the launch, the Maritime Security Unit (MSU) of the Deep Blue Project, comprising personnel from the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air Force, Nigeria Police, and Department of State Services, are conducting simulation exercises for the event on the land, air, and sea assets of the Project to confirm their readiness for full deployment. It is worthy of note that the various military formations in the region are aware of the exercise.\n\nWhile this exercise is on-going, members of the public, especially those living in coastal communities, are advised to remain calm, as this exercise is only meant to test the readiness of the assets.\n\nAccording to Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Bashir Jamoh, \u201cWith the deployment of the assets of the Deep Blue Project, we are entering another level of national security designed for total spectrum maritime security and better domain awareness using some of the latest technology.\n\n\u201cThis effort to secure our waters would give Nigerians more leverage to harness the enormous resources of our maritime environment and aid the drive towards economic diversification.\u201d\n\nThe project, which was jointly initiated by the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Federal Ministry of Defence, is being implemented by NIMASA.\n\nThe main objective of the Deep Blue Project is to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. The Project has three categories of platforms to tackle maritime security on land, sea, and air.\n\nThe land assets include the Command, Control, Communication, Computer, and Intelligence Centre (C4i) for intelligence gathering and data collection; 16 armoured vehicles for coastal patrol; and 600 specially trained troops for interdiction, known as Maritime Security Unit. The sea assets include two Special Mission Vessels and 17 Fast Interceptor Boats. The air assets comprise two Special Mission Aircraft for surveillance of the country\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); three Special Mission Helicopters for search and rescue operations; and four Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Deep Blue Project is the first integrated maritime security strategy in West and Central Africa with the aim of tackling the incidences of piracy, sea robbery, and other crimes at sea.\n\nNIMASA noted that while prosecution of suspected criminals used to be a challenge, the Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offenses (SPOMO) Act passed by the 9th National Assembly would now provide a legal backing for prosecution and punishment of offenders.",

The honest answer is that the country is already broken up spiritually.\n\n\u201cTalk to any Nigerian. Do Nigerians feel that they are part of the same country right now?

          "text": "By Tom Okpe\n\nMinority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu has said that for any constitution to have legitimacy and acceptance as democratic, it must be a product of the people\u2019s will, through citizens\u2019 participation.\n\nElumelu who commended the Delta state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, for hosting the zonal hearing, assures people of the zone that pertinent issues such as resource control, citizenship registration, fiscal federalism, improved derivation formula, devolution of power, as well as democratization of electoral processes would be looked into by the committee, as well as the 9th Assembly in general.\n\nThe lawmaker, fondly referred to as the \u201cpride of Delta\u201d who chairs the subcommittee stated these while delivering his welcome address at the opening of the ongoing South-South Zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nHe said: \u201cIndeed, the convergence of our leaders and citizens from the three states that make up this cluster, underscores the urgency and significance the people of the states; the people of the Niger Delta region and indeed Nigerians at large, attach to this exercise.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we go into this exercise, we must bear in mind that every democratic constitution is made by the people for the fulfilment of their collective aspirations and objective as a society.\n\n\u201cConsequently, any constitution that does not guarantee the fulfilment of such aspirations, is to the extent of such shortcomings, defective, frustrating and cannot deliver benefits to the people. Instead, such constitutions breed discontentment dissonances, agitations, violence, restiveness, economic retardation and political frictions.\n\n\u201cThe current 1999 constitution (as amended) has been adjudged by many as being replete with grave defects which are inimical to and frustrating the practice of a federal system that most Nigerians desire.\n\n\u201cThere are also agitations for creation of additional states as well as the inclusion of the traditional institution as a special tier with statutory roles for our traditional rulers.\n\n\u201cAcross the Niger Delta region, there has been demands that the Federal Government should completely relinquish ownership, control, and management of oil and gas resources situated in the various states of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed further that, \u201cas a critical stakeholder in the Niger Delta, I have witnessed firsthand, challenges that lead to various agitations. These include the agonizing poverty and lack, unemployment, disregard to demands for local content in employment and other opportunities that abound in the oil and gas sector, oil spillage and environmental degradation, decayed infrastructure and painful neglect, despite the huge economic resources coming from the region.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the situation had led to restiveness and avoidable violence, adding that voices of Nigerians in the Niger Delta region have become unmistakably loud, \u201cand it is my belief that the time has come for us to address these vexed issues and ensure a more stable and productive nation, through the desired constitution amendment.\n\n\u201cThis public hearing therefore offers a voice as well as an ear to the aspiration of the people. Of course, any system that ignores such loud voice from the citizens is doing so at its own peril\u201d, he added.\n\nThe House Minority Leader however stated that in all the the amendment process represents, they do not include or in any way condone the disintegration of the country, stressing that the unity on Nigeria remains non-negotiable, whilst posing some pertinent questions.\n\n\u201cIt is however imperative to state that nothing in this exercise gives room for any question on the unity and corporate existence of Nigeria as one indivisible nation. The public hearing and desired amendments, rather than detract from our national cohesiveness, are aimed at consolidating on our national unity by ensuring a stronger federal system with greater participation of citizens in governance at all levels.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge all stakeholders and participants to come up with progressive submissions and recommendations that will engender stronger national unity and greater productivity.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, what are the practical modalities for state creation, acceptable state policing, civil service system, land use, control and ownership; judiciary jurisdiction, taxation and other subjects of agitation among sub-national units? What statutory recognition can be accorded to the traditional institutions and what appropriate roles can be prescribed for traditional rulers,\u201d he queroed.\n\n\u201cThese and many more are serious issues that require concerted consideration,\u201d Elumelu said.",

          "text": "The Ekiti State Government has suspended implementation of the minimum wage for its senior civil servants following dwindling revenues accruing to the state.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the action followed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the government and organised labour on Friday in Ado Ekiti.\n\nUnder the agreement, government partially suspended for three months, the consequential adjustment for workers on grade levels 07 to 12.\n\nHowever, workers on grade levels 01 and 06 were not affected in the economic adjustment measure as they would continue to earn their N30,000 minimum wage.\n\nNAN reports that those represented the government at signing of the MoU were the Head of Service, Mrs Peju Babafemi and Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Labour Matters, Oluyemi Esan.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Office of Establishment and Service Matters, Mr Bayo Opeyemi, also witnessed the signing.\n\nThose who signed on behalf of labour were the Chairmen, Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Ekiti State chapter, Kolapo Olatunde, his counterparts in the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the state chapter, Sola Adigun and Joint Negotiating Council (JNC), Kayode Fatomiluyi, as well as their secretaries.\n\nThe TUC chairman, who read the agreement, said that the suspension of the consequential adjustment for certain categories of workers would take effect from May to July.\n\nAdigun said it was also agreed that the salaries of political appointees and accounting officers be slashed by 25 per cent for a period of three months in the first instance.\n\nHe said that the agreement also include the reduction of grant for the running of government establishments.\n\nAccording to him, the monthly meeting of the `Economic Review Committee\u2019 will convene five days after the meeting of the Federal Account Allocation Committee.\n\nHe said that this was to keep the workers abreast of the state\u2019s financial position.\n\n\u201cIt was also agreed that 10 per cent Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state, being the state responsibility to Joint Account Allocation Committee is to be released to the local governments henceforth.\n\n\u201cIn the pact, government reassured that it would not downsise or retrench any worker as a result of the present economic crunch hitting the state,\u2019\u2019 Adigun said.\n\nThe head of service recalled that Gov. Kayode Fayemi had at a recent \u201cState of the State Finance\u2019\u2019 programme, presented the financial report of the state.\n\nBabafemi said that it was evident from the report that the two sides \u2013 government and labour, must shift grounds as a response to the economic realities.\n\n\u201cThe revenue generating committee has been saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that the state work hard and rakes in more monies to finance the state.\n\n\u201cI am confident that Gov. Kayode Fayemi will surely bring his ingenuity and wealth of experience to bear and we shall navigate out of this difficult situation soon.\n\n\u201cWe thank the labour leaders for their understanding and show of solidarity,\u2019\u2019 She said.\n\nThe SSA to the governor on Labour Matters also commended labour leaders for showing understanding on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe labour has been supporting the government since inception in 2018.\n\n\u201cWhen government is taking a stiff decision like this, please let us show understanding knowing that this present government is worker friendly.\n\n\u201cLet us continue to be partners in progress,\u2019\u2019 Esan pleaded.\n\nThe JNC chairman noted that workers in the state were passing through hard economic times.\n\n\u201cThe government must adhere strictly to this agreement because it is a painful one, but we call it a \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe have to abide by it in the interest of our dear state and colleagues in the service.\n\n\u201cNo labour leader would want his workers disengaged directly or indirectly and we thank the government for not thinking in this direction. That is the direction we want our colleagues to look at it.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring our workers that we will continue to protect their rights always,\u2019\u2019 Fatomiluyi said. (NAN)",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nThere is outrage and anger in Nigeria following the Federal Government\u2019s suspension of Twitter indefinitely in Nigeria.\n\nNigerians have taken to Twitter to condemn government\u2019s move, which many described as madness and obnoxious.\n\nIn a statement released on Twitter by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, government attributed the suspension to what it called the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria\u201d, added Segun Adeyemi, the Special Assistant To The President (Media).\n\nTwitter had come into the crosshairs of the Buhari government after its police deleted two tweets and a video, in which President Buhari threatened to invoke civil war treatment to arsonists, separatists and insurrectionists destroying public assets.\n\nReacting to the development on Friday, Nigerians expressed shock that this could happen in this era and century.\n\nAccording to Adetutu Balogun, \u201cFG announces suspension of Twitter in Nigeria via Twitter\u2026 awon werey.\u201d\n\nDanny Walter said \u201cThe problem with this News of Federal Government banning Twitter in Nigeria is that they\u2019ve given these Police Men another Avenue for extortion. \u201cPark\u201d \u201cOpen your Phone\u201d \u201cOh you dey use Twitter, enter Van criminal.\u201d\n\nAccording to JP, \u201cGuess which app Federal Government uses to announce the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNappy Blaze said \u201cThey sent the military to protesters and we trended #EndSARS. The President made a genocide tweet and twitter deleted it. The Government got angry and went to suspend Twitter in Nigeria and we are already downloading VPNs. Una too stubborn ffs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kabiyesi, The King, \u201cCrashing economy, Kidnappings, Banditry and killings everywhere but your priority is to ban Twitter in Nigeria ?? We\u2019re ruled by absolutely terrible people.\u201d\n\nSomto Onuchukwu added: \u201cThe coward Gen. Buhari has gone from turning off his comment section to banning twitter in Nigeria. This is not time for bants, we should occupy Nigeria on #June12Protest #OccupyNigeria2 #BuhariMustGo.\u201d\n\nNielda said \u201cThe federal government intention to suspend Twitter in Nigeria is a clear view of how cranky they think. If they take such action in fighting insecurity in the country, Nigeria will be a better place.\u201d\n\nUgochukwu Ugwoke tweeted: \u201cThe swiftness of President Buhari in banning Twitter in Nigeria is another evident proof that his government does not care about Nigeria & Nigerians. This is the same man who has done little or nothing to address the insecurity problems in Nigeria. Our lives mean nothing to him.\u201d\n\nMohnice stated: \u201cTwitter suspended Donald Trump, and USA did not suspend Twitter Small tweet delete, Buhari ban twitter in Nigeria! We are now Left with crowwe or VPNs. Dunno but, Why is Nigeria like this, who is behind this mess fgs.\u201d\n\nVIP Vendor added: \u201cWhen twitter deleted President Trump\u2019s account US didn\u2019t suspend twitter. Ordinary deleted post our daddy\u2019s at the top is suspending twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFarooq Kperogi stated: \u201cDoes Lai Mohammed know that there\u2019s a little something called VPN that Nigerians can use to circumvent the Federal Government\u2019s so-called ban on Twitter in Nigeria? These ignorant, prehistoric creatures in gov\u2019t never cease to amaze with their insufferable boneheadedness.\u201d\n\nNerfatiti, said \u201cThe FG may suspend the Constitution. So be readying to hit the streets. It\u2019s a full-blown dictatorship. Now that Lai Mohammed\u2019s Federal Government has directed the NBC to block access to Twitter in Nigeria, I\u2019ll show you steps how you can download a \u201cVPN,\u201d & bypass.\u201d\n\nFormer BBNaija star, Tacha lamented: \u201cParents were live on Arise TV today crying and the problem is Twitter in Nigeria??? Jesus take the wheel.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reno Omokri, \u201cHow can you announce your suspension of @Twitter on Twitter and expect to be taken seriously?\n\n\u201cTwitter brought @MBuhari to power. He can\u2019t climb the ladder to the top then prevent others from using it. @Facebook also deleted his genocidal post. Will he also suspend Facebook?\n\n\u201cThe suspension of the activities of @Twitter in Nigeria by the @MBuhari administration should be ignored by @Jack. The Buhari government has no means to effect the suspension, and even members of the administration are still on Twitter.\u201d",

          "text": "By Wole Soyinka\n\nWe heard it last during the heydays of Donald Rumsfeld under George Bush \u2013 and judge in what condition it has left that part of the world, and beyond. Rumsfeld\u2019s namesake \u2013 a sobering coincidence \u2013 also spat the same gung-ho rhetoric. That Donald once ordered his uniformed forces to \u201cgo out there\u201d and \u201cdominate the environment\u201d, following civilian protests at extra-judicial killings of blacks by state police. Soon enough, leaving nothing to chance, that Donald II seized on the first opportunity to personally mobilize a mob to \u201cdominate\u201d Capitol Hill, his own seat of government that was clearly slipping from his control.\n\nOptimists are free to underplay that threat to the much-acclaimed democratic beacon. Study that scenario carefully however, and you find It is not a question of: it could never have succeeded. Such surmises are wrong, It COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED, albeit with unpredictable consequences for America and the world. And so, when the elected head of a democratic state like Nigeria, not perched precariously on the knife edge of power but with a couple more years in the kitty, threatens to \u201cshock\u201d dissidents, we should indeed be shocked out of any complacency. Even if History has been deliberately eliminated from the school\u2019s curriculum, Memory suffices to jerk us into a watchful, precautionary alert.\n\nI hold no brief for those who resort to burning down police stations, slaughter their occupants simply for the crime of earning a measly monthly pittance, torch electoral offices, assassinate politicians in calculated effort to set sections of the country against others in the promotion of their own political goals. These are largely nihilists, psychopaths and/or criminal lords, soul mates of Boko Haram, ISWAP, Da\u2019esh and company, not to be confused with genuine liberators. All over the world, throughout history, elections are denounced, boycotted, and generally delegitimized without recourse to wanton butchery.\n\nWhen, however, a Head of State threatens to \u201cshock\u201d civilian dissidents, to \u201cdeal with them in the language they understand\u201d, and in a context that conveniently brackets opposition to governance with any blood-thirsting enemies of state, we have to call attention to the precedent language of such a national leader under even more provocative, nation disintegrative circumstances. What a pity, and what a tragic setting, to discover that this language was accessible all the time to President Buhari, where and when it truly mattered, when it would have been not only appropriate, but deserved and mandatory!\n\nWhen Benue was first massively brought under siege, with the massacre of innocent citizens, the destruction of farms, mass displacement followed by alien occupation, Buhari\u2019s language \u2013 both as utterance and as what is known as \u201cbody language\u201d \u2013 was of a totally different temper. It was diffident, conciliatory, even apologetic. After much internal pressure, he eventually visited the scene of slaughter. His language? Learn to live peacefully with your neighbours. The expected language, rationally and legitimately applied to the aggressors, was exactly what we now hear \u2013 \u201cI shall shock you. I shall deal with you in the language you understand\u201d. That language was missing at the moment that mattered most. It remained \u201cmissing in action\u201d for years until a belated \u201cShoot at sight\u201d outburst. Too late, and of course, inappropriately phrased. The precedent had been set, the genie let out of the bottle, consolidating a culture of impunity that predictably spread its bloody stain all over the nation.\n\nBuhari\u2019s recent deployment of this language is thus wrongly targeted, and tragically untimely. Even while he was threatening dissidents, an agenda of both secessionism and alien occupation was taking place not too distant from Aso Rock. ISWAP was taking over the already excised territories of Shekau\u2019s Boko Haram, appointing new warlords of the occupational forces, sectioning Nigeria into vassal states and unfurling their replacement flags of domination. Soon, logically, ISWAP\u2019s letters of diplomatic accreditation will be presented in Aso Rock?\n\nWe must however backtrack a little \u2013 that is the function of memory. It would be false to suggest that these eggs of impunity are newly laid. They have been incubating in loathsome hatcheries of power and domination for years, even decades, and now the raptors have been hatched and taken wings. The political culture of the devil\u2019s bargain, of denial, evasion, avoidance of constitutional mandates, the culture of \u201cappeasement of the unappeasable\u201d \u2013 to quote myself \u2013 in order to gratify the vested interests of a narrow, power obsessed elite has blossomed. Finally, the chickens have come home to roost.\n\nThe evocation of the Civil War, where millions of civilians perished, is an unworthy emotive ploy that has run its course. In any case \u2013 and this has been voiced all too often, and loudly \u2013 the nation is already at war, and of a far more potentially devastating dimension than it has ever known. Every single occupant of this nation space called Nigeria has been declared potential casualty, children being pushed to the very battlefront, without a semblance of protective cover. We have betrayed the future. We need no breast beating about past wars. The world has moved on, so have nations. Some, however, prefer to move backwards. The continent is full of these atavists. In Nigeria, powerful cliques of this persuasion still roam the corridors of power We are indeed at war. It does not take the formal declaration of hostilities, with or without lethal bombardments, for a nation to find itself shell-shocked. The populace of this nation is already in that shell-shocked condition. So, what is there left to shock?\n\nIt is time to think \u201coutside the box\u201d. That many, in so doing, find no landing place except dissolution, is not a crime. It is not peculiar to any peoples, and is embedded in the ongoing history of many, and not only on this continent. It is their natural right as free citizens, not slaves of habit and indoctrination. Where disillusion rides high, sentiment tumbles earthwards, and the only question becomes: what can be salvaged? It thus remains the responsibility of leadership to persuade them, through both discourse and remedial action, that there are other options. Attempted bullying is not a language of discourse, nor the facile ploy of tarring all birds with the same feather.\n\nI shall end on a personal note. It was not intended but, in view of breast thumping rhetoric by one president after the other over military sacrifice \u2013 undeniable, certainly \u2013 such recalls should be considered salutary. The heroic exploits of our military in confronting some of the deadliest internal forces of dehumanization deserve their place of honour, not only in history, but in contemporary consciousness. However, let not the military fail to take its place centrally in the nation\u2019s ongoing, unavoidable soul searching. And so to an instructive intervention by this \u201cbloody civilian\u201d, in what should be an exclusionary portfolio of the keepers of a nation\u2019s mandate for secure existence.\n\nIt took months for me to effect a meeting, agreed in principle, with a former National Security Adviser. It took that long only because I refused to meet him within the country, since it had become clear that the security forces, in addition to high levels of governance, had become infiltrated by the very vicious elements that have fully established and sustained a lethal dimension. I was not about to let myself be \u201csold out\u201d to unseen forces in my eagerness to sound an oppressive warning. We eventually met in London. The records, I am certain, will be found in the National Security files and, in any case, I went accompanied. My mission was straightforward \u2013 to let him know that the nation was under siege, that the nomadic herdsmen that then threaded the forests were of a different breed from those whom we normally encountered in that environment that was also close to second home to some of us. We met. That National Security Adviser assured me that the military was aware of this, and that his mission to the United States was to negotiate the purchase of spotter planes to patrol the forest routes. I retreated, satisfied, to my normal preoccupations. No, not entirely true \u2013 I did take other supplementary steps internally, including meetings with high level state officials in the West.\n\nNow comes the rub! imagine the chagrin, this past week or two, as revelations emerged, ten years after that meeting, of humungous amounts from oil resources being found in the US off-shore accounts of that pivotal figure of any nation\u2019s security architecture! Is that an exceptional tale? Not in the least! He is not the first multi-starred general to be thus exposed, some even brought to trial. While Boko Haram was consolidating, a Nation\u2019s Security Czar was also consolidating his nest egg with funds meant for elimination of a national scourge.\n\nShock? No. Civil Society already has a superabundance of the military shock treatment!\n\n\u2013Prof. Wole Soyinka is is a Nigerian playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and a Nobel Laureate winner in Literature",

Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest.

Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nIt was not the first time the Buhari administration has demonstrated intolerance against foreign platforms.\n\nIt did it against CNN, faulting the global news platform for its claim of casualties in the Lekki shooting by soldiers.\n\nJust yesterday the government also slammed U.S. based Foreign Affairs magazine over an article titled: The Giant Is Failing, a fair account on the unravelling of Nigeria under the Buhari presidency.",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019s a threat to nation\u2019s corporate existence \u2013 CDS \u2018\u20266,145,000 illegal arms with civilian non-state actors\u2019\n\n\u2026Increases insecurity, deaths \u2013 Ex-head of state\n\n\u2026Drives increasing violence rate in Nigeria \u2013 Oxfam\n\n\u2026Land borders, maritime routes poorly manned \u2013 Experts\n\nDespite the efforts being made by security agencies to tackle the myriads of security challenges confronting the country, insecurity is on the increase and experts have attributed it to the proliferation of weapons. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a second look at the issues amidst citizens\u2019 growing concerns.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Learn more,\u201d Twitter said.\n\nTwitter activities \u2018suspicious\u2019\n\nReacting to the tweet deletion, Minister Mohammed had held a press conference on Wednesday at the State House in Abuja.\n\nHe accused Twitter of being impartial in its curation and said the social media firm\u2019s activities were suspicious.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nHe said Twitter had displayed bias during the #EndSARS protest which led to the looting and destruction of government and private property.\n\nThe minister asked what rule President Buhari had violated to warrant his tweet to be deleted.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centers, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d",

          "text": "A 15-year old senior secondary school student who was allegedly hit by a police stray bullet on February 5, 2020 during a clash between police officers and protesting commercial motorcyclists, has testified before the Lagos State Judicial Panel on Restitution for Victims of SARS-related abuses.\n\nMariam Shobukola who was in SSS 1 at the time told the panel that on February 5, 2020, the proprietor of the Delight International School, in Aboru, Iyana-Ipaja, where she attends, asked her to accompany the headmistress to go out and make a cash transfer at a POS shop in the area. She says, while waiting to collect the receipt after the transaction, she fell down and couldn\u2019t remember what happened afterwards.\n\nMariam, who broke down in tears during her testimony, confirmed that she has undergone two surgeries and a physiotherapy since then and lost at least one academic session, as her mates are now in SSS 3. According to the victim who appears to have greatly improved after her gory ordeal says she still experiences pains in her stomach, head and legs, and cannot stand or walk for long.\n\nThe Chairperson of the eight-member panel, Retired Justice Doris Okuwobi, also admitted as evidence, the blood-stained uniform which the victim wore on that fateful day, which was tendered through her counsel, Bernard Onigah.\n\nDuring cross examination, she also told police counsel, Joseph Ebhoseremen that she didn\u2019t witness any fighting in the area at the material time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother witness, Gbola Orefuyi who is a CDA chairman in Aboru, said he stood by the family throughout the period, and that a colostomy (a major surgery that brings out one end of the large intestine through the abdominal wall) was performed on Miss Shobukola at the Lagos State Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, while she had to stool and urinate inside an attached bag for about nine months because her large intestine was affected.\n\nHe revealed during cross examination that the Lagos State Government assisted the family with about N1.9 million to foot part of the medical expenses, and that the Nigeria Police Force offered the sum of N20,000, which the family rejected.\n\nThe stray bullet pierced the stomach of the teenager and ruptured her bladder, when she was caught up in an ensuing commotion after scores of commercial motorcyclists began agitating against the high handedness of police officers enforcing the Lagos State Traffic law in Aboru.\n\nAfter she was hit, Mariam, was rushed to Peak Health Hospital and then taken to the General Hospital, Orile Agege, before she was transferred to LASUTH.\n\nThe family is seeking a N10 million naira compensation from the panel. Their petition is adjourned to June 15, while the panel ordered that summons be served on one Dr Fatai Balogun, a consultant at LASUTH, while the victim\u2019s father, Mukaila Shobukola is also billed to testify at the next date.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of social networking service Twitter.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nThe Minister said the federal government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe federal government had on Wednesday accused the social media giant of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Twitter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed.\n\n\u201cBy whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen. I think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one.\n\nWhat about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d",

We understand that after the two rounds these situations will be clear.\u2019\n\n\u2018I am not avoiding answers and I am giving facts, with the understanding that I have,\u2019 Tite added. \u2018Copa America is very important. But our match tomorrow is more important.\u2019\n\nBrazil has recorded about 470,000 deaths from the ongoing Covid pandemic, and health experts are expecting a third wave of infections later this month.\n\nSome protests have been staged against the government regarding the decision to switch the Copa America to the country amid the rise in Covid cases and economic uncertainty.\n\nBut Brazil\u2019s stars have yet to speak out publicly about why they are against hosting Copa America, which starts in just nine days time.",

More than two dozen other children were injured, they said.\n\nBut other sources say it was started by an electrical fault in one of the cells. The blaze was put out soon after.\n\nAFP quotes a security official as saying the head of the facility, which houses around 200 girls aged between 14 and 17, was immediately detained.\n\nThe news agency also reports that prosecutors have opened an investigation into the cause of the fire by questioning survivors.\n\nThe state-run newspaper Akhbar el-Yom reported that the children were not able to flee the fire because the ward was locked.\n\nSafety standards and fire regulations are poorly enforced in Egypt and have been linked to many deaths.\n\nIn March, a fire at a garment factory near Cairo killed at least 20 people and injured 24 more.\n\nThere were around 52,000 fire incidents in Egypt in 2020, resulting in 199 deaths, compared to over 50,660 accidents in 2019 that killed 252 people, according to the country\u2019s official statistics agency.",
