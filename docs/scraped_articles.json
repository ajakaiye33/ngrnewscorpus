          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nThe Social Democratic Party SDP has expressed deep anger at the propensity of political money bags to rig elections in the country, saying ahead of the 2023 general election, it has become imperative to advocate the death penalty for election riggers.\n\nThis was as the party kicked against zoning of the Delta state Governorship ticket to the Central Senatorial District, saying in a state like Delta with its political maturity and as home to eggheads, competence must trump zoning.\n\nREAD ALSO:Where\u2019s N1bn Buhari approved for D\u2019tigress?\n\nChairman of the party in the state, Amb. Oke Idawene who is also the Chairman, Forum of SDP State Chairmen, stated this in an interview with Saturday Vanguard.\n\nHe commended the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC for its decision to deploy the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System BVAS in the September 11 state Assembly bye election in Isoko South 1, Delta state, saying the technology helped to reduce incidences of multiple voting.\n\nIdawene said the device was able to guarantee the credibility of voter accreditation by preventing incidents of multiple voting or the use of stolen Permanent Voter Cards PVCs to vote while the use of the incident form was eliminated.\n\nElection rigging\n\nOn rigging, he said the problem is not with INEC but other stakeholders. He said; \u201cThe problem we have right now is not INEC. It is the people. Somebody tried to snatch a ballot box in Isoko South and he was gunned down. I don\u2019t like bloodshed, but that is the way to go. Ahead of 2023, the punishment for such electoral malfeasance should be death by hanging. Anybody rigging elections is an enemy of the people and must be so treated.\n\n\u201cWith the BVAS, the votes were not adulterated. There was no rigging in that election. For the first time in Nigeria, I went for an election where until the morning of the elections, the collation officers were not known and the voting pattern was clear.\n\n\u201cTo this end, I think we should give INEC all the support for electronic voting, electronic collation and transmission of results. It is only then we can get genuine leadership and see Nigeria tilting towards progressive tendencies. I want to call on the National Assembly to support this BVAS and other technologies used by INEC\u201d.\n\nOn Zoning the 2023 presidency to the South and the Delta Governorship ticket to Delta Central, the SDP Chairman said; \u201cSDP is not for zoning. We are for competence. It is time we stopped regional tendencies. Nigeria is one. No matter how you try, you cannot break us. Let us elect a leader who is a true Nigerian in body, soul and spirit so that at the end of the day we can say we are going forward.\n\n\u201cSDP is anti-zoning. For the Southern leaders, if you want the presidency, I call on you to lobby. Power is not given for free. It is a collective responsibility. Leave your comfort zones and go to the North and explain why you should be given the opportunity to produce the next president. Apart from that, every Nigerian is qualified to run for president.\n\n\u201cIn Delta state, the Central is claiming that it is their turn to produce the next governor. No. I am a Delta. I have the right to contest. If Delta Central wants to contest election and win, let them come out and convince us in the South and North why we should give you room to produce the next governor come 2023. Apart from that, do not claim it. It is not your right. You lobby for it. Power is not given for free\u201d, he added.",

          "title": "What Akinwumi Adesina told Buhari",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nBy Prisca Sam-Duru\n\nThe state of the nation is getting more pathetic by the day, with so much hunger, insecurity, violence and high unemployment rate driving the country to the brink. The speech by the President of the African Development Bank Group, Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, at the Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat, comes as a panacea to Nigeria\u2019s recovery.\n\nSpeaking on the topic, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Economic Resurgence: Learning from the African Experience\u2019, Dr Adesina who was Guest Speaker at the retreat held October 11, 2021, in Abuja, gifted the federal government of Nigeria, a most loaded and padded speech; the content of which if implemented, will engender the country\u2019s economic resurgence.\n\nStating the fact that the corona virus \u201cpandemic has caused so many deaths and upended global economic growth\u201d, he noted that \u201cdue to COVID-19, Nigeria\u2019s economic growth rate declined to -1.8% in 2020. This mirrors the pattern across Africa, as the continent posted a -2.1% growth rate in GDP, its lowest in two decades\u201d.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:Lack of scanners major cause of congestion at nation\u2019s ports \u2014 Reps\n\nHe however posited that the country\u2019s recovery, expected in 2022, \u201cwill depend on two critical issues: access to vaccines and tackling debt issues\u201d. He added that Nigeria must build quality health care systems that will protect its population, today and well into the future, as well as world-class local pharmaceutical industries, able to effectively tackle the production of therapeutic drugs and vaccines. \u201cNigeria must revamp its local pharmaceutical industry and launch strategic investments for local vaccine manufacturing. Africa should not be begging for vaccines; Africa should be producing vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe African Development Bank will invest $3 billion in support of local pharmaceutical industries in Africa, including in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nAdesina also insisted that \u201cNigeria must decisively tackle its debt challenges. The issue is not about debt-to-GDP ratio, as Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio at 35% is still moderate. The big issue is how to service the debt and what that means for resources for domestic investments needed to spur faster economic growth. \u201cThe debt service to revenue ratio of Nigeria is high at 73%.Things will improve as oil prices recover, but the situation has revealed the vulnerability of Nigeria\u2019s economy. To have economic resurgence, we need to fix the structure of the economy and address some fundamentals\u201d.\n\nDr Adesina advised government to \u201csignificantly boost productivity and revenues from its non-oil sector, with appropriate fiscal and macroeconomic policies, especially flexible exchange rates that will enhance international competitiveness\u201d, adding that \u201cThe private sector should be given incentives to invest in infrastructure.\n\n\u201dThe Federal Government\u2019s15 trillion Naira Infrastructure Fund is a good idea, so is the initiative for tax credits for private sector investment in infrastructure. To be sustainable and more efficient, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) should be accelerated to finance major infrastructure across Nigeria\u201d, he stated. Regarding trade, investment, and competitiveness, he explained that \u201cThe Africa Continental Free Trade Area presents a major opportunity for Nigeria. Consumer and business expenditures in Africa are projected to rise to $6.7 trillion by 2030.\n\n\u201cSignificant support should be directed toward boosting industrial manufacturing capacities. Nigeria should also move rapidly to the top of selected value chains, such as automobiles, computers and electronics, textile and garments, and food manufacturing, transport, and logistics\u201d.\n\nMuch, he noted in this regard, will depend on the ports of Nigeria. \u201cAccording to the sector operators, the cost of exporting 100 tons of cargo in Nigeria is $35,000, compared to $4,000 in Ghana. Today, the leading ports for West Africa are in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin Republic. All these countries have modernized their port management systems, leaving Nigeria far behind\u201d.\n\nNigeria, he said can \u201clearn from Morocco\u2019s world-class Tangier-Med port. The port is unique in that it is an industrial port complex, and a platform that has over 1,100 companies. They collectively exported over \u20ac 8 billion worth of goods in 2020\u2033.\n\nSharing his experience at the Tangier-Med Port, Dr Adesina said, \u201cI actually thought they were on vacation, as I did not see people; just machines, haulers, automated systems moving containers in what looked like a well-synchronized maze, with incredible efficiency. There were no kilometers of trucks waiting to get to the port\u201d.\n\nSuggesting the adoption of the Morocco port model, he declared that \u201cWe should not be decongesting the ports in Nigeria, we should be transforming the ports. Nigeria should rapidly modernize and transform its ports. Ports are not there for revenue generation. They are for facilitating business and exports, and stimulating industrial manufacturing, and competitiveness of local businesses and exports\u201d.\n\nAnother approach to Nigeria\u2019s recovery he recognized, is to boost food security, reduce the price of food, and ensure greater competitiveness of the agricultural sector. The \u2018Growth Enhancement Scheme\u2019 and the e-wallet system which he deployed while as Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria, which led to fall in prices of food due to increase in production, he revealed, have been adopted in Togo, Liberia, and other African countries, \u201cYet in Nigeria where they were developed, they are no longer being implemented\u201d. He pointed out that lack of rain, insecurity, middlemen, are not the major factors responsible for low food production but \u201cthe main reason is that farmers no longer have access to quality improved seeds, fertilizers, and farm inputs at scale\u201d.\n\nWhile joining farmers across the country to plead with the Federal Government to restore the popular Growth Enhancement Support Scheme and the e-Wallet system so as to put millions of farmers at the heart of agriculture at scale, Dr Adesina said, \u201cif this is done, and run well, I can assure you that you will see a dramatic turnaround in national food production\u201d.\n\nHe further called on government to take \u201cbold policy measures to drive the structural transformation of agriculture, with infrastructure and spatial economic policies\u201d.\n\n\u201dThe key for this is the development of Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs)across the country. Nigeria should establish Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones all across the country. The e-Wallet System and Growth Enhancement Scheme, to boost farmers access to productivity enhancing farm inputs should be reinstated and enshrined in law. Policy reversals should be avoided\u201d, he maintained.\n\nWith the rate of unemployment and youth involvement in societal ills soaring, as part of the recovery strategies for the country, Dr Adesina suggested, that it was high time Nigeria unleashed the potential of her youth. \u201cToday, over 75% of the population is under the age of 35. More decisive actions are needed to turn this demographic asset into an economic dividend. A young, productive, youthful population, with access to education, skills, social protection, affordable housing, and medical care, will power Nigeria\u2019s economy, now and well into the future\u201d, he explained, emphasizing that \u201cWe must move away from so-called \u2018youth empowerment programs\u2019. The youth do not need handouts.\n\nThey need investments.\u201dThat is why the African Development Bank is currently working with Central Banks and countries to design and support the establishment of Youth entrepreneurship investment banks. These will be new financial institutions, run by young, professional, and highly competent financial experts and bankers, to develop and deploy new financial products and services for businesses and ventures of young people. Several African countries have already indicated their readiness to establish Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Banks\u201d.\n\nBy establishing Youth entrepreneurship investment banks, he said Nigeria would be making its youth the drivers of the new economy.\n\nThe place of technology as one of the industries that will dominate the future, cannot be overemphasized. On this note, the African Development Bank Group president, disclosed that by \u201c2030, 650 million Africans will have smart phones, and 50 million will have 5G phone networks. Digital payments, mobile money accounts, savings, credit, and money transfers will revolutionize businesses. Nigeria\u2019s FinTech is surging as one of the leaders in Africa today\u201d. He therefore, advised government to position the \u201cFinTech industry as a major driver of the economy, and invest heavily in digital infrastructure\u201d.\n\nAnd then, the biggest issue- insecurity. An economically resurgent Nigeria Dr Adesina insisted, \u201cmust be a more peaceful and secure Nigeria\u201d. According to him, \u201cToday, more than ever, several African countries are spending a significant share of their budgets on security, displacing the resources needed for development\u201d.\n\nHe lamented that on an alarming rate, \u201cthe investible space in many parts of Africa, including Nigeria, is shrinking due to insecurity and insurgencies.Yet, resources are not there to enable countries to cope with these rising challenges\u201d, adding that \u201cWe must recognize the strong linkages between security, investment, growth, and development\u201d.\n\n\u201dWithout security there cannot be investment, without investment there cannot be growth, and without growth there cannot be development. The African Development Bank stands ready to help Nigeria in the design and implementation of Security-Indexed Investment Bonds to raise more resources to tackle its security challenges\u201d, he stated.\n\nNot leaving out issue of climate change which is also crucial to the country\u2019s economic recovery, Dr Adesina averred that if Nigeria does not prioritize climate adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change will pose challenges to the country\u2019s economic resurgence. \u201cClimate change has already decimated the whole of the Lake Chad basin. Today, that vast area, which used to provide livelihoods and resources for fisheries, livestock and food production is now littered with patch lands, dried up water beds and scorched earth. He therefore advised government to prioritize the re-charging of the Lake Chad basin, as well as drive for a just energy transition, with natural gas; to protect its economy, assure energy for industrialization, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, pledging that \u201cThe African Development Bank will mobilize $25 billion in climate finance by 2025 in support of African countries\u201d.\n\nAnd finally, on how much progress Africa Development Bank is making so far, he said \u201cThis year, Global Finance, the globally renowned U.S Magazine, rated the African Development Bank as the Best Multilateral Financial Institution in the world for 2021. \u201cThat is the kind of Africa we want! Africa showing global excellence in the midst of a turbulent world, finding solutions, and driving innovation and change, at scale\u201d.",

          "text": ",\n\nBy Juliet Ebirim\n\nIn order to re-orient boys and men on issues bordering on gender-based violence, a boy-child transformation movement, Boys Quarters Africa is collaborating with the Lagos Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency on the \u2018Project Sabi Initiative\u2019.\n\nIn a meeting during the week with the Executive Secretary, Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency \u2013 Mrs Lola Vivour-Adeniyi, the founder of Boys Quarters Africa, Solomon Ayodele re-iterated the organisation\u2019s plan to collaborate with the agency on the project.\n\nAyodele revealed that the project, which will run for eighteen months, is in partnership with Connected Development (CODE) and Oxfam-Voice and aims at educating boys from thirty schools in Lagos, Enugu and Abuja.\n\n\u201cIgnorance plays a major role when it comes to combatting gender-based violence, especially as it relates to men and boys. It is easy to fix men, but it\u2019s easier to build boys. For men, it could be just sheer ignorance because some of these things have been passed down culturally by their parents. Some of the things we know about consent today were things we were never taught. We believe that if you don\u2019t educate, you cannot criticize. That\u2019s why we are paying a lot of attention to education.\u201d he noted.\n\nHe also stated that the organization plans to run a training programme for the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) to tackle gender-based violence across motor parks.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of assumption when it comes to gender-based violence as it relates to men and boys. We thought of creating grassroots mobilisation where we can sit men, boys down and educate them, more like an awareness project to take out that gender box where the world feels mean and boys know,\u201d he said.\n\nAyodele also emphasised that men and boys are key players in the campaign against gender-based violence, thus the major point of collaboration with the agency is the creation of Boys Club, as well as utilizing the already existing templates of the agency in terms of curriculum development, data, mobilisation of facilitators among others.\n\nOn her part, Lola Vivour-Adeniyi commended the organization\u2019s initiative and pledged her support to the project. She also highlighted the agency\u2019s efforts towards tackling gender-based violence.\n\nHer words: \u201cThe agency is doing a lot, especially collaborating with the Ministry of Justice, Education, WAPA, to ensure the sustainability of combating gender based violence and we are progressing. We are open to partnering in the areas of training, providing mentors for boys, inaugurating clubs in schools. All hands have to be on deck and the agency remains committed to instilling the right values.\u201d she said.\n\nThe highlight of the meeting was the presentation of a SABI Tee Shirt to the agency\u2019s Executive Director as an ambassador in mobilising men and boys towards ending violence against women and girls.",

          "title": "Bishop Mike Okonkwo: Nigeria needs a ruthless leader with a human face",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nThe Presiding Bishop of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), Dr. Mike Okonkwo, has impacted lives as a preacher of the gospel. A one-time seasoned banker with Africa Continental Bank (ACB), he went into church ministry when pastoral work, especially Pentecostalism, was like a joke. But he\u2019s remained focused on his calling for a long time. In fact, for about 40 years since he founded TREM, he has remained relevant and versatile as a preacher. This is evident in the fact that the former President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), and Vice-Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), passionately preaches \u201cPower in the Word\u201d to a multicultural and diverse audience in Nigeria and across the globe even till today. He recently clocked 76. In this interview, he talks about mentorship, what he would like to be remembered for, and the state of the nation.\n\nIn your 76 years of existence, you must have seen a lot. What lessons have you learned about life?\n\nLife is about how much you can be a blessing to others or humanity. At the end of the day, it is what you did to influence other people that will matter. The legacy anyone should be shooting for in life is: who has my life influenced; who have I impacted? It is not about buildings, houses, cars, and all those things. Who can you say that your life has changed? That is what is principal. If the pandemic did not teach anyone a lesson, nothing else will. During the pandemic, I opened my wardrobe and saw dresses. Dresses would be looking at me and I would be looking at them. Before the pandemic, I could go anywhere with them and turn eyes on me. Bu now the shoes are there; you are not going anywhere. The car is grounded because of the pandemic. God is simply saying these things are nothing. What gives me joy? It is the fact that there are people who have benefited from me. It is the fact that you have a need and I\u2019m in a position to help you. And, I did help. The same way I helped you, go and help others. For me, that\u2019s life.\n\nWhat would you want to be remembered for as Bishop Mike Okonkwo?\n\nRemember how much I was able to touch you. Just remember how my life changed your life. That\u2019s all. Not much.\n\nYou have mentored many pastors within and outside Nigeria. Who mentored you in your early days as a preacher? Which men of God have impacted your life over the years?\n\nWhen we came on board, there were very few people who were visible in charismatic and Pentecostal churches. Most of the existing churches were white garment churches. Foursquare Gospel Church and Assemblies of God were the two major churches you could call \u201cliving churches\u201d in those days. Even The Redeemed Christian Church was more of a prayer group. There was nothing like Mountain of Fire. Deeper Life was a ministry, not a church. By the time we came into ministry, we hooked up with Foursquare. I was inviting the founders of the church regularly to our church then in Akoka. Rev. Dr. Boyejo James Abayomi, of blessed memory, was the first General Overseer of Foursquare. I was also in a relationship with Dr. S.O Odunaike, who also was a leader in the church. He is late now. Then those who came subsequently after them like Faroumbi, (he\u2019s also retired) and Rev. Wilson Badejo, also late, we had a good relationship with them. In fact, he served under me as my deputy in the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria. I was in touch with Foursquare; it was a ministry I looked up to in those days. I am talking about the people that I had relationships with. There was also Archbishop Benson Idahosa. Internationally, there was Dr. Morris Cerrullo, who had also gone to be with the Lord. Now, you have leaders of like minds that you should surround yourself with, people of the same apostolic calling. Those who are behind us cannot say they don\u2019t have good examples to follow: people who they can look up to; people who can help to mentor them. I have people I relate with in real terms. They include Pastors Adeboye, Ayo Oritsejafor, Dr. Omobude, the immediate past President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, and Dr. Paul Nwachukwu. These are people who don\u2019t need anything from you. They can tell you where you are wrong without mincing words.\n\nWhat do you think the church can do to have a better Nigeria?\n\nI don\u2019t think I agree with your concept. How about China? Do they worship God? What of Indians who worship thousands and millions of gods? What about Dubai? They are Muslims. Some years ago, Dubai was an ordinary desert. I\u2019m not advocating that we should live a godless life. What I\u2019m trying to say is that what you are saying is not the issue. Rather, it is the re-orientation of the mind. These nations I just mentioned took the principles of the scriptures and applied them and things began to change for better for them. Mind you, many of them are still serving their idols or gods. The truth is, if you apply the Biblical principles to your life, you will get the same result. Where there is no vision the people perish. Thus says the Bible. It didn\u2019t say it\u2019s for Christian or Muslims; it\u2019s for every person. If you have a vision, you will get to your goal. \u201cWhatsoever a man sayest with his mouth\u201d\u2026 you can have what you say. It\u2019s not meant for Christians alone. When people operate on Biblical principles, they get results. Sometimes I read in newspapers about people calling for national repentance. As good as it sounds, that is not our problem. Are we all Christians? Nigeria is not a Christian country but a multi-religious, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic nation. You can\u2019t force people to become Christians. God put them there just as he put Christians, atheists, homosexuals, and lesbians. They are here and you can\u2019t force anyone to be a Christian except he or she wants to. This same God is making the rain fall and the sun shine on both the bad and the good. So, you don\u2019t need to Christianize Nigeria before you can begin to enjoy the goodness of God.\n\nNo. It\u2019s about principle and mindset. Do you have a vision? Do you have a drive? Are you daring? Are you bold in stepping out and getting things done? Those are the things that bring results. So, it\u2019s the mindset. Look at Mandela. After being in incarceration for over 20 years, he could have come out and said, now that I have gotten what I want, I\u2019m not stepping down from power for anybody.\n\nThose are leaders. Our problem is, we don\u2019t have moral leaders, I\u2019m not talking about Christians \u2013 who will say something and stand by it? That is integrity. Kwame Nkrumah said that if the kind of liberty that they are going to give to him will result in the incarceration of others in Africa, putting them in bondage, he does not want it. These are leaders who understand what they are doing.\n\nTalking about the country Nigeria, let me say that the way we are now as a nation, we need a leader who has a ruthless attitude and a human face. If there are things he needs to do whether people like it or not, he should do it.\n\nIf there are people to put in jail, send them to jail. This country is not going to change with kid\u2019s locks. As we speak now, everywhere you turn to in this country is rotten. I used to say this in a joking way. I ask people, is it Buhari the one in the customs? Is he the one collecting duties at the Wharf, and is he the one at the borders? It is Nigerians. Is Buhari the Vice-Chancellor of the University who has refused to take care of the university even though they give them votes to take care of some financial problems? It is the people. How did Rwanda change? Everyone is celebrating the progress that Rwanda has made today. Go and ask what Kigali did to get to the economic position it is now in spite of years of ethnic hostilities.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Funsho Arogundade\n\nRoseline Omokhoa Afije aka Liquorose is the first runner-up and last girl standing of the just concluded Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye season 6.\n\nPrior to her selection as a housemate, the 26-year-old professional dancer, who started her dancing career at the age of 12, claimed to have different personality traits. She went into the show to display all of it and came an inch closer to winning the big prize.\n\nIn this chat, the Edo State-born Liquorose narrates her experience while in the house and what she has in stock as a new reality show star.\n\nHow do you feel coming close to winning the Big Brother Naija\u2019s N90 million big prize?\n\nTo be honest with you, it\u2019s still shocking to me that I emerged as the first runner-up. It\u2019s overwhelming and I didn\u2019t see it coming. I actually imagined myself being in the finals but I didn\u2019t really believe I would emerge the first runner-up. The first runner-up? It was shocking! Days after, I kept asking myself if I was actually on stage with the eventual winner. Till date, I still find it shocking, walking straight from the house with the eventual winner, White Money to that stage as the first runner-up of Big Brother. I was just overwhelmed.\n\nYou had a huge fan base before going into the BBNaija house unlike some other housemates that were rarely known. Is it that you didn\u2019t go in expecting to win the competition?\n\nNot really. Of course, I wasn\u2019t aware who my fellow housemates would be. I only got to meet them when I entered the house. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t thinking of my fan base as an advantage. In fact, I was actually scared of what those fans and others outside would say or feel about me. Big Brother is a massive reality television show and one has to be 100 per cent real and entertaining. It\u2019s not about having a large fan base outside but giving people what they want to see about you. So, I went in and was just hoping and praying to God to see me through.\n\nWhile in the house, you turned out to be a bundle of energy and almost hyperactive\u2026\n\nBig Brother Naija is a huge platform where everyone wants to go to showcase their talents. It\u2019s a platform where you have to be real and entertaining. For me, as a dancer, I really love to dance and act as well. So, I saw an opportunity to exhibit other talents the world was yet to discover about me. So, Big Brother provided that platform I had always wanted, and since finally I was there, why can\u2019t I pour out everything?\n\nWhat was the most fulfilling part of being a housemate of BBNaija?\n\nThere were two instances: when I won the Head of House as the third female in the season, and also when I won a task involving a basketball game. For me, it was a big deal and exciting because prior to that, I didn\u2019t know how to play basketball. Even the guys were enthralled and were asking me how I managed to pull that.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for Liquorose?\n\nThere is a lot in the kitty. I have actually been reached out to by a couple of talent managers, but I am taking my time in making decision.\n\nAs a new reality TV star and entertainer, what experience are you looking forward to pushing out now?\n\nBefore I went into the house, there were so many things I wanted to do but I didn\u2019t have a platform to showcase them. Now that Big Brother has given me the needed exposure and push, I think I am ready to go. I would like to do music and movies. I am a writer and content creator. Before Big Brother Naija, I had written scripts for short films; I had recorded some content for my dance crew, Girls Got Bold (GGB) and I am already working on a book. I also write songs and have written quite a number of poems. So, I am looking forward to releasing my collection of poems as well as showcasing my singing talent.\n\nTell us more about your book?\n\nI have always wanted to write books that will look into my family background, my life experience as well as imaginative and fictional stuff. I actually haven\u2019t completed any but while I was in isolation, I started writing a book and already finished two chapters. Now that I am out, I am going to work at concluding it and share it with the world.\n\nNow that you are a star, what would become of your crew, GGB?\n\nThey supported me 100 per cent while in the house and even now. So, my new status is not going to affect Liquorose nor GGB, rather it\u2019s going to be of positive influence. For now, we are going to be bigger. Those are my sisters and they are my partners. We are sisters for life. We are always together. So, it\u2019s not going to affect my crew in any way. We have the same goal, same ambition and achievement. So, this is just like the beginning of what my crew and I are about to show to the world. I am going to try as much as possible to create the balance because GGB is me and I am GGB. Liquorose and Girls Got Bold, we are one. We are going to create a balance.\n\nSince you came out of the BBNaija house, what would you say has been the most shocking part of your newfound fame?\n\nThere are lots, but what I find most shocking now is that, even if I cough, it spreads everywhere. At the same time, the love has been massive. I was in Kano last week, the love, support and energy for Liquorose was overwhelming. I saw men and women coming to me, and I was so humbled.\n\nHas that put any pressure on you?\n\nNo pressure at all. The energy has been so positive and exciting for me. But it comes to me like: is this for real? Prior to going into the house, I had been there but not as big as I am now. I already have an idea or experience of what a celebrity life could be. So, nothing is going to change me negatively.\n\nNow, how do you intend to sustain the momentum?\n\nI am a born entertainer, an all-round entertainer. As a combination of talent, people should expect more from me in the area of entertainment, arts and business. I am fully ready to keep the energy so that the whole love can be so enduring.\n\nWhen would real love and relationship come into your plans?\n\nLet\u2019s see how it goes but I am open! I am presently in a good place and taking my time before getting involved in any love or relationship. I really want to be focused now on achieving my different goals and ambitions.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "title": "2023: Where president comes from doesn\u2019t matter, says Bakare",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe founder of Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, on Friday met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, to dispense with what he said was in his heart.\n\nThis is even as he charged the National Assembly to improve on its record of quality legislation by working to achieve electronic voting.\n\nAccording to him, there is the need for the nation to adopt electronic voting to ensure that no Nigerian of eligible voting age including those in the Diaspora who remit $25 billion annually are disenfranchised.\n\nBakare, who was the running mate of the Buhari under the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in 2011, spoke to State House Correspondents after the meeting with President.\n\nOn the on-going debates over presidential power rotation, Bakare said the agitation is being fuelled by political immaturity, arguing that the debate ought to have bordered on the capacity and character of whoever will be allowed to lead the country.\n\n\u201cI said it on the 3rd of October. It\u2019s our immaturity, politically and otherwise, that makes us say power must either be in the North or be in the South, instead of looking for the best, the fittest, the most competent, and people of character, who love this nation.\n\n\u201cListen to me, if where the president comes from will make the place he has come from to be better, the Northern part of Nigeria should be richest and should be the most progressive and the most developed because out of 61 years, the north has produced either the president or heads of state for 40 to 41 years and yet, see the retrogression in the North.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s from the South, why should a person like President Obasanjo freeze and seize the account of Lagos State in his own tenure? If it\u2019s from South-South or South-East why couldn\u2019t President Jonathan use all his powers to develop South-South and the South-East?\n\n\u201cNot where they come from, it\u2019s what they carry and what they have to offer. May the best of the best of Nigerians rise, whether they\u2019re from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south.\n\n\u201cIf there are agreements between politicians among themselves on rotation, a bargain is a bargain. That\u2019s between them. But as far as this country is concerned, what we need at this stage is man who can drive us to the Eldorado\u201d, he said.\n\nThe cleric commended the National Assembly for approving electronic transmission of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), describing it as one of the best things the federal legislature had so far done.\n\nReacting to the recent approval for electronic transmission of election results, he said: \u201cPerhaps one of the best things the present National Assembly has done, especially the Senate, because with that, Nigerians can vote and then results can be transmitted so easily. Not only that, part of the State of the Nation address that I did on October 10, I emphasised how Nigeria youth, especially undergraduates, are disenfranchised in our country.\n\n\u201cI said 22.3 million students are registered, but during elections, campuses are shut, they will not be able to return there to vote, therefore disenfranchised. If we can do not just transmitting results, but to be able to vote electronically, that will be wonderful. It will deepen and enhance our democracy.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the Diaspora sends above $25 billion to Nigeria. Nigeria in Diaspora should also be able to vote like they do in every other country in the world. The more, the merrier. Yes, democracy is a game of numbers, but our people should have the final say. So, the office of the citizen must be as important, if not more than the office of the governor or the president because they are the people who put them in power. Sovereignty still lies in the hands of the people of Nigeria,\u201d, he said.\n\nThe cleric also said his call for restructuring of the country does not involve Balkanisation, but explained that a peaceful restructuring is possible, when justice, equity and the rule of law are allowed to take hold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019 said it, it\u2019s in the open, the documents are already there, it\u2019s not something I can cover in five minutes. We can do it without shooting any gun. The lecture after lecture after lecture, I have prepared and I\u2019ve made copies available to Mr President.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it, to move this nation forward. The founding fathers of this nation; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, alongside with their entourage, in Lancaster House and everywhere, agreed on what type of government Nigeria should have. We must not change the goalpost in the midst of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better off together as a nation than going our different ways. But it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and a rule of law\u201d, he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

It will be recalled that both brothers, who worked for the company of Prince Arthur Eze, while working for him as staff and earning fixed salaries, all of a sudden while still under the employment of Prince Arthur Eze, fraudulently and criminally acquired properties amounting to billions of naira in choice areas of some states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. This ugly discovery made their boss, Prince Arthur Eze to report the case to the EFCC, which promptly investigated the case and subsequently commenced prosecution of the two brothers. The court had earlier granted an interim forfeiture order to give room for the defendants to show reasons why a final forfeiture order should not be granted by the court.

          "title": "In Landmark Move, Cambridge Returns Benin Bronze Cockerel",
          "text": "*Legendary Okukor to arrive Nigeria October 27\n\nCharles Ajunwa\n\nJesus College, University of Cambridge, England yesterday announced that it would hand over a Benin bronze cockerel, Okukor, to a Nigerian delegation on October 27, in a gesture Nigerian officials said \u201coffered hope for amicable resolutions\u201d of the ongoing disputes over the ownership of its cultural properties.\n\nThe Okukor, described by the college as a \u201croyal ancestral heirloom,\u201d was taken from the Benin Kingdom during a punitive expedition in 1897, when thousands of bronzes were looted by British forces.\n\nIt will be the first stolen artefact to be returned and this is expected to spark a wave of repatriation ceremonies, as the cultural world continues to reckon with concerns over the ethics of plundered historical artefacts.\n\nJesus College, the first British institution to return one of the stolen bronzes, in what it described as \u201ca historic moment\u201d, said officials of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments will formally collect the Bronze in its College on October 27.\n\n\u201cDelegates from the Commission and Benin will visit the College for a ceremony to complete the handover process and celebrate the rightful return of the Bronze,\u201d said the college.\n\nMs Sonita Alleyne, OBE, Master of Jesus College, said: \u201cThis is an historic moment. We look forward to welcoming representatives from Nigeria and Benin to the handover ceremony and to celebrating the return of this Bronze.\n\n\u201cThis is the right thing to do out of respect for the unique heritage and history of this artefact.\n\n\u201cSince we took the decision to return the Bronze, following the College\u2019s Legacy of Slavery Working Party\u2019s (LSWP) extensive research, many organisations have followed in our footsteps. I would like to thank the LSWP for its diligent and careful investigation into the provenance of the Bronze, to the Fellows for their keen support for its restitution, and to our students who pioneered calls for this.\u201d\n\nIn a message to the college, His Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin, Ewuare II expressed his delight at the return of the artefact which he described as important to the religious beliefs of the Benin people.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are indeed very pleased and commend Jesus College for taking this lead in making restitution for the plunder that occurred in Benin in 1897.\n\n\u201cWe truly hope that others will expedite the return of our artworks which in many cases are of religious importance to us. We wish to thank our President Buhari and our National Commission for Museums and Monuments for their renewed efforts in securing the release of our artefacts on our behalf.\n\n\u201cFinally, we wish to thank the student body of Cambridge University for bringing to light the historical significance of this revered piece of the Royal Court of Benin. It is worthy of note that our father attended Cambridge University but was then Prince Solomon Akenzua. He later ascended the throne of our forefathers as Omo N\u2019Oba Erediauwa, Oba of Benin.\u201d\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed and the Director-General, NCMM, Professor Abba Isa Tijani, expressed gratitude to Jesus College for setting the pace in the return of the artefacts.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cWe thank Jesus College for being a trailblazer and we look forward to a similar return of our artefacts by other institutions that are in possession of them.\u201d\n\nTijani added: \u201cThis return offers new hope for amicable resolution in cultural property ownership disputes. We hope that it will set a precedent for others around the world that are still doubtful of this new evolving approach whereby nations and institutions agree with source nations on return without rancor.\n\n\u201cOn our part, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments is receiving this antiquity for the benefit of the Benin people and the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Okukor was removed from public display at the college following calls from students for it to be sent back in 2016.\n\nIn May 2019, Jesus College set up its Legacy of Slavery Working Party \u2013 comprising Fellows, staff and student representatives \u2013 to explore the historical, legal and moral status of the College\u2019s ownership of the Bronze. They examined evidence showing that the statue was looted directly from the Court of Benin, as part of the punitive British expedition of 1897, and was given to the College in 1905 by the father of a student.\n\nAfter Jesus College announced its decision to return the bronze in November 2019, a host of regional museums committed to or said they were also considering returning artefacts.\n\nThe UK retains hundreds of Benin bronzes \u2013 plaques and sculptures \u2013 dating to the 13th century, made by artisans from the Edo culture. They were distributed from private collections and in some cases donated by soldiers who took part in the 1897 looting. Historically, much of the focus has been on the British Museum, which holds 900 objects \u2013 the largest collection in the world.\n\nThe campaign to repatriate Benin bronzes gained momentum when Bernie Grant, one of Britain\u2019s first black MPs, made vigorous appeals in the 1990s for their return. But it has been a contentious debate that has recently become embroiled in culture war clashes.\n\nEarlier this year, the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, objected to \u201cthe removal of statues or other similar objects\u201d and urged museums to \u201cdefend our culture and history from the noisy minority of activists constantly trying to do Britain down.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Parallel assemblies likely in 13 states\n\n*Fence-mending maneuvers crumble\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nWith the dusts raised by the local government congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yet to settle, the party is today going ahead with its state congresses, to elect officials for these levels of its structures.\n\nThe scenario of the local government congresses, characterised by protests, boycotts, and the election of parallel executives by the different factions in many states, looks set to repeat itself across the country.\n\nParallel congresses are likely in at least 13 states in spite of the various fence-mending sorties carried out by the various committees vested with that duty.\n\nThe parallel assemblies would flow from what transpired during the local government congresses where sharp divisions existed, with various factions foughting for the control of the party and structures.\n\nThough Zamfara and Anambra states will not be participating in today\u2019s exercise, Abia, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Adamawa, Lagos, Imo, Enugu, Sokoto, Kano and Katsina are expected to hold parallel congresses.\n\nAbia State\n\nDuring the Ward and Local Government congresses in Abia State, parallel congresses between the factions loyal to the state Chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa and Chief Ikechi Emenike were held. The same drama is expected to play out today. Barely 24 hours to commencement of the congress, elders of the party declared that no state congress would hold in Abia today.\n\nAPC caucus leader in Abia State, Senator Nkechi Nwogu, Chief Sam Nkire, Ume Kanu, Mr. KC Ugboajah and Hon. Elton Onwu and Mr. Chijioke Ikpo called the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to recall the state congress committee sent to Abia State.\n\nAddressing journalists yesterday in Abuja on behalf of the elders, Chris Adighije said any attempt to hold the congress in the state would create problem, confusion and plunge Abia into further crisis.\n\nDelta State\n\nDespite the High Court order restraining the conduct of the last local government congresses in Delta State, a faction of the party led by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, organised the exercise which he described as peaceful.\n\nThereafter, Delta State APC Leaders\u2019 Council called on the National Caretaker Committee to annul the Ward and Local government congresses and organise fresh, all-inclusive congresses.\n\nThe council stated in a communiqu\u00e9, jointly signed by 19 party members including the Chairman of the Council and Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo, Dr. Alex Ideh, the Co-Chairman, the Council Secretary and former Executive Director of NDDC, Cairo Ojougboh and APC\u2019s Governorship Candidate in 2019 in Delta State, Chief Great Ogboru, among others, that they were not satisfied with the manner of the exercise.\n\nWith the spat unresolved till date, it is doubtful if it will be a one house today devoid of boycotts.\n\nAkwa Ibom\n\nThe National Secretary of the APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio will also renew their rivalry in the state today.\n\nWhile Akpanudoedehe controls the state chapter of the party, being an older member of the party, Akpabio is fighting to get hold of the party\u2019s structure in the state.\n\nThe supremacy battle between the two led to the holding of parallel congresses in the 31 LGAs of the state during the local government congresses. The same is expected to be repeated today, as both factions are still in the contest of who blinks first, as issues in contention between the two gladiators are still fresh and potent.\n\nEnugu\n\nThe situation is not different in Enugu State where former Senate President, Ken Nnamani and the state Caretaker Committee Chairman, Ben Nwoye are locked in opposing sides and striding for control of the soul if the party and none of them has agreed to loosen their grip.\n\nThe local government congresses produced different leadership structures in all 17 council areas of the state due to failure to resolve contending issues. It is also expected that a parallel state congresses will hold today.\n\nOgun\n\nThe Supremacy battle between the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun will be renewed today. There has been no love lost between the two political leaders.\n\nThe Chairman of the Congress Committee for Ogun State, Wale Ohu fears there would be parallel congresses and voiced that much when he said he was inundated with inquiries on how things would go today.\n\nThe indication that another congress by a faction was in the offing was when he said, \u201cI have the mandate of the National Secretariat of the party to vet, screen and conduct the Ogun State congress of the APC. No other election is valid, except the one by my committee of seven sent by the National headquarters of the party.\u201d\n\nOsun\n\nOsun is going to be another battle ground today, especially between Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola and the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola with each of them pulling the strings.\n\nDuring the local government congresses, members of the APC who belong to The Osun Progressives (TOP), a political movement loyal to Aregbesola held their congress at Comrade Ola-Oni Centre in Osogbo, while those who belong to the Ileri Oluwa group \u2013 the political movement of the governor held theirs at the Osogbo Federal Constituency office.\n\nLagos\n\nDespite Lagos being the home state of the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, the party has been factionalised as far back as 2018.\n\nThe two APC factions in Lagos State are the Tunde Balogun-led group and the Lagos4Lagos group. Like it happened during the local government congresses where parallel congress were held across the state, similar scenario is expected to take place today. In fact, the situation was so tense that unconfirmed reports said State Executives expected to be elected today were announced yesterday evening even ahead of the exercise.\n\nRivers\n\nIn Rivers State, there are two factions of the party. One is led by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi while the order is led by Senator Magnus Abe.\n\nDuring the local government congresses, Amaechi\u2019s faction participated, while Abe\u2019s faction boycotted the exercise. The story is not expected to be different today. It is either going to be a boycotted congress or a parallel one\n\nKwara\n\nIn Kwara, the faction loyal to the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed has been having a running battle with the faction loyal to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\n\nThe faction loyal to Mohammed recently opened a parallel party secretariat in the state. During the local government congresses, the two factions held separate congresses.\n\nSokoto\n\nSokoto State chapter of the APC is set to hold parallel congresses.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the factional leader in the state, Dr. Balarabe Salame said like the wards and local governments congresses, his group had arranged for a state congress today.\n\nSalame, who is a former acting Governor and current member representing Illela/Gwadawa Federal constituency, lamented his group bought forms but were not contacted on when and the mode of Congress.\n\nSalame accused the leader of the party in the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko of creating factions in the party to achieve his political aim.\n\nImo\n\nThe fight between former governor Rochas Okorocha and incumbent Governor Hope Uzodinma appears unabated, as well as Ifeanyi Ararume who boycotted party activities. But it is no longer clear if he will still be in the trenches as he has been appointed Chairman, Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.\n\nHowever, there is still no love lost between Uzodinma and Okorocha. No matter how it pans, the exercise will either be boycotted by one faction or a parallel congress will result.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Canvasses electronic voting for future polls\n\n*Says debate on power rotation fuelled by political immaturity\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church (CGCC), Pastor Tunde Bakare yesterday canvassed for electronic voting in future polls in the country, while also not ruling out the possibility of running for President come 2023, \u201cif it is the desire of God with the support of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe also declared that the controversy over rotational presidency was being fueled by political immaturity, saying the debate ought to have centred on the capacity and character of whoever would be allowed to lead the country.\n\nBakare, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, was asked if he would be running for the office of the President in 2023, and he said: \u201cEvery Nigerian, who is of age and who is not disqualified by any means, is free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a nation builder, if God wants me to do that, and the people of Nigeria will appreciate that, why not? I\u2019m as free as anybody to do anything with my time. I\u2019ve pastored a church for 33 years, now we raise new leaders. I want to focus on nation building.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the President is only one office, there\u2019re so many other things we can do as people to support whoever is there to make sure that we do not go into retrogression, but begin to make steady progress as a people. I\u2019ve already communicated clearly, my future plans to Mr. President, and it stays between us.\u201d\n\nOn rotational presidency, Bakare said: \u201cIt\u2019s our immaturity, politically and otherwise, that makes us say power must either be in the North or be in the South, instead of looking for the best, the fittest, the most competent, and people of character, who love this nation.\n\n\u201cListen to me, if where the president comes from will make the place he comes from to be better, the Northern part of Nigeria should be richest and should be the most progressive and the most developed because out of 61 years, the north has produced either the president or heads of state for 40 to 41 years and yet, see the retrogression in the North.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s from the South, why should a person like President Obasanjo freeze and seize the account of Lagos State in his own tenure? If it\u2019s from South-South or South-east, why couldn\u2019t President Jonathan use all his powers to develop South-South/South-east?\n\n\u201cNot where they come from, it\u2019s what they carry and what they have to offer. May the best of the best of Nigerians rise, regardless of whether they\u2019re from the east, or from the west, or from the north, or from the south.\n\n\u201cIf there are agreements among politicians on rotation, a bargain is a bargain. That\u2019s between them. But as far as this country is concerned, what we need at this stage is a man who can drive us to the Eldorado.\u201d\n\nBakare also advised the National Assembly to better its record of quality legislation by working to achieve electronic voting in future polls nationwide.\n\nHe commended the National Assembly for approving electronic transmission of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), describing it as one of the best things the federal legislature had so far done.\n\nOn the recent approval for electronic transmission of election results by the National Assembly, he said: \u201cPerhaps, that is one of the best things the present National Assembly has done, especially the Senate, because with that, Nigerians can vote and then results can be transmitted so easily. Not only that, part of the state of the nation address that I did on October 10, I emphasised how Nigerian youth, especially undergraduates, are disenfranchised in our country.\n\n\u201c22.3 million students are registered, but during election, campuses are shut, they will not be able to return there to vote, therefore disenfranchised. If we can do not just transmitting results, but to be able to vote electronically, that will be wonderful. It will deepen and enhance our democracy.\n\nBakare, who ran in 2011 on the same Presidential ticket as President Buhari, also said his call for restructuring of the country did not involve balkanisation, but explained that a peaceful restructuring is possible, when justice, equity and the rule of law are allowed to take hold.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cI\u2019d said it, it\u2019s in the open, the documents are already there. It\u2019s not something I can cover in five minutes. We can do it without shooting any gun. The lecture after lecture after lecture, I have prepared and I\u2019ve made copies available to Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it, to move this nation forward. The founding fathers of this nation; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, alongside with their entourage, in Lancaster House and everywhere, agreed on what type of government Nigeria should have. We must not change the goalpost in the midst of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better off together as a nation than going our different ways. But it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and rule of law.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is plotting to organise concerts with celebrities to distract youths from participating in the EndSARS remembrance event.\n\nNigerian rapper, Folarin Falana, popularly known as Falz, made the allegations in a social media post on Friday.\n\nPopular Instagram comedian, Debo Adedayo, also known as Mr. Macaroni, had earlier taken a swipe at celebrities for accepting Sanwo-Olu\u2019s invitation to perform at a concert meant to hold days before the Lekki shooting anniversary.\n\nMacaroni, who rebuked celebrities for refusing to speak up against the government\u2019s move to quell planned #EndSARS memorial events, charged them to rethink their association with the government.\n\nFalz alleged that the Lagos State governor planned to use the concert as a distraction to prevent the youths from participating in the EndSARS memorial event.\n\nHe noted that the police were already at the Lekki tollgate to restrict Nigerian youths from exercising their fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cAs I type this, there is already a HEAVY police presence at the Lekki toll gate.

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa currently operates in a hybrid co-living and remote work environment. About half of the team live on the same premises, and once every month, we take a trip to the market to stock up on food items. Almost without fail, we discover that the prices of foodstuffs have increased since our last visit. Often, we complain, but because we have to eat, we pay for the products.\n\nRising food prices have become commonplace in Nigeria in recent years. However, not every Nigerian can be like those of us who grumble yet pay. For most people, even the slightest increase in food prices could be the difference between sending their kids to bed hungry and having just enough to eat.\n\nI tried painting a picture of what food inflation looks like, but this tweet about the increase in the price of sardines does a pretty good job.\n\nI just bought sardine at \u20a6675.\n\n\n\nIt was around \u20a6600 two weeks ago,\n\n\n\nand \u20a6300 early this year. Advertisement September 23, 2021\n\nWorld Food Day is observed annually on October 16 to draw attention to issues surrounding food supply, production, distribution, nutrition, and starvation, among other challenges. To commemorate this year\u2019s celebrations, we look at issues that affect food production and supply in Nigeria, highlighting the work of two agritech startups.\n\nIn addition, we spotlight the effects of food inflation and steps Nigeria can take to meet its food requirements but first, what is food inflation and what causes it?\n\nCauses of food inflation\n\nFood inflation refers to a situation where the prices of food items keep increasing. When this happens, consumers have to spend more to get the same goods they got at different prices in the past. Demand outstripping supply and supply being affected are the two major causes of food inflation. In Nigeria, the second reason is often the reason for the increase in food prices.\n\nWhile writing this article, I took a trip to the local market where I spoke to the traders to understand why food prices are constantly increasing. Surprisingly, most traders were clueless. Nonetheless, they did provide some insights.\n\nThe first trader, who identified herself as Mama Imole (Imole\u2019s mother), could not categorically state why the prices of food items were constantly increasing. She, however, offered an explanation \u2013 the agricultural inputs needed by farmers, such as pesticides and fertilisers, had become more expensive. It, therefore, makes sense that they increase the prices of their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of fish\n\nAnother factor that affects the price of food is infrastructure, of which transportation is a major component. There is no fixed cost for transporting goods in Nigeria as the state of the roads often varies in different parts of the country. An increase in fuel/diesel costs could also affect prices. To recoup their losses, farmers/traders often pass these added costs down to the final consumer.\n\nInsecurity is another factor that affects food prices in Nigeria. Since 2002, the Northern part of Nigeria has been plagued by activities of the dreaded Boko Haram. In recent years, the herdsmen crisis has taken centre stage, further complicating an already disturbing situation.\n\nConsequently, farmers in the North can\u2019t go to their farms. For a country that imports a significant part of the food it consumes, any disruption of local production adversely affects the price of food items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEffects of food inflation\n\nEveryone feels the effects of food inflation but at different levels, from the mother who has to decide what to leave out while grocery shopping to the trader who has to sell almost twice as much to meet previous sales targets; there really is no winner.\n\nMama Imole believes that increasing food prices present a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Traders can\u2019t sell as much as before because consumers\u2019 reduced purchasing power means they do not buy as much as they once did.\n\nMrs Adeniji, another trader, shares the same opinion. Since no farmer can produce all the food items their family needs, they buy what they need from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more significant effect is one that Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of agritech startup, Releaf, points out. With Nigerians spending almost 60% of their income on food, he argues that it is more difficult for them to invest in themselves.\n\n\u201cThe impact on society is that people are unable to invest in themselves. So, on average, Nigerians spend 60% of their income on food, which only leaves the other 40% to invest in their education, health, passion, etc.\n\nSo if we want to create a world where Nigerians can reach their full potential, we have to create a world where Nigerians can decrease the portion of their income spent on essentials like food.\u201d\n\nTo put things in context, consumers in the US spent about 8.6% of their income on food in 2020, freeing up 91.4% for use in other aspects of their life.\n\nThe role of agritech startups in tackling food inflation\n\nLike other areas of the Nigerian economy, tech and tech-enabled startups have sprung up to solve the problem of food inflation. One such startup is Releaf. Currently playing in the palm kernel oil processing space, the startup purchases palm kernels from its network of over 3,000 smallholder farmers.\n\nThe startup developed Kraken \u2013 its proprietary technology \u2013 which it uses to crush palm kernels to produce palm kernel oil for its industrial clients.\n\nInfrastructural challenges dog the average entrepreneur, and logistics for agricultural products are a major challenge. Bad roads and insecurity add to the cost of transporting agricultural produce from the rural areas, where most of the production is done, to factories or markets.\n\nTo solve this problem, Releaf employs a decentralised approach when situating its factories. Rather than build factories in Nigeria\u2019s major cities, they site factories close to the farmers, thus reducing logistics costs and ensuring they pay farmers adequately for their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nFinancing is another issue that farmers face, one which Releaf tries to solve. In June 2021, the startup announced a partnership with OnePipe to offer digital financial services to the farmers in their network.\n\nAnother agritech startup doing great work in the space is Agricorp, a company that produces, processes, and exports spices. This month, it completed a $17.5 million Series A funding round with which it plans to expand its production capacity to 7,000 metric tonnes per annum.\n\nSince its November 2018 launch, the startup has reportedly supported over 5,000 smallholder farmers with inputs and training on agricultural best practices. Using its proprietary technology, Farmbase, the startup aggregates, registers, and pays farmers for products sold.\n\nCrop2Cash is another startup solving problems in the agricultural value chain. One way it does this is by providing financing for smallholder farmers, most of whom are financially excluded. The startup also provides them with agricultural inputs and options to receive payments digitally.\n\nA plan for food security\n\nAs the cost of food rises in Nigeria, it is clear that something must be done, and quickly too. Data from Statista shows that food insecurity increased steadily from 6.6% between 2014 and 2016 to 21.4% between 2018 and 2020. In plain terms, the number of Nigerians who go days without food has increased.\n\nWhile agritech startups are doing a great job, more needs to be done if Nigeria is to feed its growing population. The most obvious is a massive investment in infrastructure to aid the transportation of produce. Moody\u2019s estimates that Nigeria needs to spend $3 trillion over the next 30 years to fix her infrastructure deficit.\n\nGiven that figure is over 20 times Nigeria\u2019s annual budget, other means of funding infrastructure must be explored, including public-private partnerships.\n\nIn addition to fixing infrastructure, effectively fighting insecurity would ensure that more farmers can return to their farms.\n\nFood is a basic necessity, and a hungry nation can have devastating effects on the economy and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office suddenly felt much colder as the young man took in the departmental officer\u2019s words. His dream of being one of the foremost robotic engineers at a top university in the Francophone world seemed to have ended before it even began as he encountered an unexpected problem.\n\nHe had told everyone who cared to listen in Cameroon that he was going to the prestigious Toulouse III University \u2013 Paul Sabatier in France to study, and he had gathered enough resources to make it happen. After a tense five-hour flight and barely enough rest the previous night, he didn\u2019t understand what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, to be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t pay with cash Monsieur,\u201d the officer responded, \u201cYou have to deposit at the bank and make the payment electronically with your card.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling hopeful once more, he thanked the officer. He darted out of the office, making a beeline for the nearest bank, where he excitedly informed the cashier of his intentions and received another shocker.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a school certificate to open a student bank account and get a card.\u201d\n\nThe young man was at his wit\u2019s end. He couldn\u2019t register for his student certificate without paying with a bank card, which he couldn\u2019t get without his student certificate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault that he went to France with cash to pay his registration fees and tuition. After all, he\u2019d left French-speaking Africa, where barely 20% of the population had access to banking services, so that was the obvious option.\n\nThe young man in this story is Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, a neobank looking to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa. PaySika has just raised $350,000 pre-seed from Angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria to fund this mission.\n\nAlongside Stezen Bisselou-Nzengue, Co-founder and CEO, Nengwe is building PaySika on Francophone Africa\u2019s existing mobile money infrastructure. It offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on their favourite messaging apps. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nIts chatbot helps users open an account, request free physical and virtual debit cards, and make transfers with these messaging apps without having to download the PaySika app or use its website.\n\nWhile the registration requirements for neobanks in Nigeria, for example, implicitly require you to have a bank account already, PaySika requires the phone number associated with the widely used mobile money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission has given him the confidence of investors like Charles Edouard Bou\u00e9e (former CEO of Roland Berger), Benjamin Chemla (founder of Stuart), and several others.\n\nNengwe\u2019s Toulouse experience was four years ago, in 2017, before he and his co-founder knew how to build chatbots and financial services applications.\n\nAs he sat in the bank, not knowing what to do next, a sandy-haired middle-aged man with what looked like a never-ending smile walked into the bank with deliberately measured steps.\n\nLooking around and waving at some familiar faces, he spotted Nengwe, whose hands covered his face as he tried to calm himself down.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Nengwe as he got within earshot, his perpetual smile still in place masking his seriousness.\n\nNengwe glanced at him, unsure if trusting a stranger in a foreign country was his best move.\n\nRealising he didn\u2019t have much choice, Nengwe explained his situation as calmly as he could.\n\nWhat followed was the stuff of dreams, the kind Nengwe had before leaving Cameroon.\n\nThis stranger offered to pay his fees with his card and collect cash. Probably more surprising was the man\u2019s seeming familiarity with his story.\n\nThis man turned out to be one of Nengwe\u2019s professors at Upssitech, in Toulouse University.\n\nThis gut-wrenching episode was pretty much par for the course for Africans migrating to study in France. Bisselou-Nzengue, with whom he would later form a close bond, also had a similar experience after leaving his home country of Gabon.\n\n\u201cLater on, I helped some people by providing them with my card and had them give me cash back,\u201d Nengwe reveals.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick to state that this is not the case for students from Germany or even Asia; it happens to just people coming from Africa.\n\nA seed had been sown, albeit in unpleasant circumstances, and both men would begin thinking of ways to solve this problem, which they figured needed to be tackled at the roots. It was clear that they had to democratise access to cards and digital payments services in countries like Cameroon where, only 34% of its adults have a bank account, DR Congo (25%), and Gabon (58.5%), to mention a few.\n\nBuilding that first MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika\n\nAfter graduating in 2019, he quickly decided that working for a company was not for him and began to put his knowledge to good use, testing some of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI started my first company, MyMoney, a chatbot that connected to users\u2019 bank accounts and sent notifications. But it failed because of product-market fit. We started working on PaySika right after,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nBeing one of the most regulated globally, Africa\u2019s financial services sector is not kind to newbie fintechs with no track record, so building PaySika wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.\n\nExpectedly, the inexperienced entrepreneurs were in dire need of cash to build PaySika\u2019s first MVP.\n\n\u201cWe entered French Tech Tremplin, a startup competition organised by the French government to invest in high impact startups. We received $23,000 that helped us in part to build the MVP at the beginning. This plus friends and family, and our own savings, of course,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nAfrica might have a distinct lack of senior developers, and local startups struggle to keep them, but PaySika is rapidly securing the goodwill of talented senior developers who experienced similar problems when moving to Europe.\n\nNengwe also reveals that while fundraising, he and his co-founder surrounded themselves with investors who understand the fintech and banking spaces.\n\n\u201cI would say we were lucky because we were able to get an amazing network of business people that really helped us understand how this startup business works.\n\n\u201cWe have investors with a background in banking infrastructure. We have some who are CTOs, and some who are really good at hiring. We just surrounded ourselves with people who are knowledgeable about key topics that affect us.\u201d\n\nA fully-locked MVP gives Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue the confidence to look for mature angel investors. Some of whom would later join its just-concluded round. But despite this funding, a mammoth-sized issue remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe financial sector in francophone Africa is heavily regulated. So we started scouring through all the details and regulatory requirements. We then partnered with some financial institutions that will help us implement what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2020, Bisselou-Nzengue, COO of PaySika, decided to hone his business skills to complement his technical background. He made the necessary preparations and left for Grenoble Business School in France for a year-long MBA in international business.\n\nThe new business he\u2019s building with Nengwe needs refining, but they seem to be headed in a promising direction.\n\nWith free physical and virtual debit cards and a 1% transaction fee on transfers, the startup does not look like it will be making much money. Nonetheless, Nengwe believes they are taking baby steps.\n\nThough the startup is yet to launch fully, it already has over 20,000 pre-registrations, mainly (90%) made up of young people aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThis was gotten organically. We didn\u2019t do any sort of aggressive marketing to get people onboard. Just referrals from different people who are excited about what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThe future is within reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNengwe says he wants to make the PaySika customer onboarding process seamless enough to cater to people without mobile money accounts. Once it can get its banking licence, it plans to add a savings account service, which he believes would be a major cash cow.\n\n\u201cWe will innovate in the offline space, so our customers can also perform transactions offline. But definitely not USSD. We\u2019re also planning to hire more experienced developers and build a marketing team.\u201d\n\nPaySika has some interesting counterparts in Francophone Africa. Ivory Coast\u2019s Djamo is building a financial super app, and Julaya wants to help businesses reach the unbanked. Wave, a mobile money service provider, became the region\u2019s first Unicorn in September 2021.\n\nAs recently as last year, it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much attention being paid to French-speaking Africa, but that seems to be changing.\n\nFor Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue, their story with PaySika is just beginning, and we\u2019ll leave several blank pages to document what promises to be an interesting journey.\n\n*The conversations and narrative may not have happened exactly the way we told it. But everything was based on facts supplied by PaySika Co-founder, Roger Nengwe, and our research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

Bacchus, Kate Reiss, et al. on Using Digital Technology for Sexual and Reproductive Health shows that healthcare is increasingly being delivered via digital channels like mobile phone messaging, social media, apps, voice, video messaging, and telemedicine.\n\nSo, I discussed sexual health and how technology can improve our sex lives.\n\nYou can read it here: How technology can improve your sex life in Africa\n\nSparkle\u2019s $3.1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nOn Thursday, October 14, 2021, Nigerian neobank, Sparkle, raised $3.1 million in seed funding to scale its operations.\n\nThe round was led by Leadway Assurance. Trium Networks and other unnamed individuals participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in the fourth quarter of 2019 by Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO, the startup says it provides seamless solutions to Nigeria\u2019s retailers, SMEs, and individuals.\n\nIn 2020, Sparkle launched Sparkle Business to offer banking services to individuals and businesses.\n\nPer Techcrunch, Sparkle differs from other neobanks because it provides Nigerians with financial, lifestyle, and business support services.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the funds will be used to develop robotic process automation to aid in mundane and repetitive tasks, and to hire talent in engineering, financial risk, and marketing.\n\nFacebook\u2019s new policy on sexual harassment of public figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? As part of a new update to its bullying and harassment policies, Facebook announced on Wednesday, October 13, 2021, that it would begin removing \u201csevere sexualising content\u201d directed at public figures.\n\nFacebook stated that as part of the policy update, it would remove any profiles, pages, groups, or events dedicated to sexualising public figures, like celebrities, politicians, and content creators.\n\nAntigone Davis, Global Head of Safety at Facebook, said that \u201csexualised photoshops and drawings, and any degrading content depicting individuals in the process of bodily functions,\u201d is prohibited.\n\nAlso, Facebook stated that it would remove \u201cunwanted sexualised commentary\u201d and repeated attacks sexually harassing a person.\n\nDavis said, \u201cPublic figures, either politicians, journalists, celebrities, or content creators use Facebook and Instagram to engage directly with their followers. We made these changes because attacks like these can weaponise a public figure\u2019s appearance, which is unnecessary and often not related to the work these public figures represent.\u201d\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nWhy Techpoint Africa is making all its past premium reports free.

          "text": "With over 80 million people, the Nigerian labour force has been earmarked as one of Nigeria\u2019s most significant strengths for economic growth. Yet, rather than being spoiled for choice, employers in the country are overwhelmed and face many challenges in finding a myriad of challenges in trying to find candidates. Challenges that are painfully time-consuming and costly, taking between 4 weeks to 6 months, depending on the level and peculiarity of the role and an estimated cost of 15% of all HR-related expenses (SHRM Survey, 2016). This estimate has increased since then.\n\nThe process of obtaining a recruit starts with identifying the need to hire and onboarding the new employee \u2013 known as the recruitment cycle. By employing better, companies can drastically minimize the frequency of the processes and therefore create room for growth and employee retention.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at the labor force. Nigeria\u2019s skills for crucial roles across dominant sectors \u2013 digital, creative, and agriculture. And quite clearly, the hours/days spent to filter through applications before the interview stage even begins.\n\nEnd-to-end recruitment, which helps ensure companies hire better, is desperately needed in a labor market as intensive and large as Nigeria\u2019s. We are witnessing companies that are otherwise brimming with potential being stagnated by poor hiring processes. There\u2019s a reason a company will publicly talk about employee retention rates as it attracts great talent and possibly investors, demonstrates workplace productivity and growth. However, that means they have likely fine tuned recruiting. Full-service recruitment platforms are hugely beneficial to all parties and make economic sense.\n\nRead also: Labour wades into COVID-19 vaccination crisis in Edo\n\nAt Jobberman, we know employees are a company\u2019s greatest asset, so we must present the most talented at each level; having over 182,000 pre-vetted candidates that are soft-skilled trained on our platform removes many of the issues employers encounter with new starters, plus we support them throughout the entire recruitment cycle after identifying the many pain points they face.\n\nCompanies that view hiring as part of their business strategy are off to a winning start; in fine-tuned most cases, that means taking on experts to help with the process. There must be a strategy to hire better, where objectives and goals can be matched against\u2014the days of long recruitment cycles that drain resources and dynamic companies.

          "text": "The gigantic oil refinery being built in Lagos by Africa\u2019s richest man Aliko Dangote will save Nigeria from the shame of having to import refined petroleum products but it could also be a possible trigger for the floatation of the naira, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria said in Washington on Friday.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF meetings in the US capital, the Emefiele enumerated the litany of gains from the refinery which is expected to cut Nigeria\u2019s import bill by about 40 per cent when it begins operation before the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, \u201cby that time, you will see what we would be doing when people talk about floating the naira, and then let\u2019s see how the currency will depreciate.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the country currently spends about 40 percent of its dollar earnings on the importation of petroleum products, putting pressure on the local currency.\n\n\u201cBy the time the Dangote Refinery begins operation, it would be a major FX saving source for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: Dangote Refinery in talks with traders for loan \u2013 Reuters\n\n\u201cRight now, the overall forex we spend on imported items, the importation of petroleum products consumes close to 30 percent (by the time you add diesel, aviation fuel, petrol and the rest of that).\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery has the capacity to produce 650,000 barrels per day. There is a domestic component that is about 455,000 barrels. Even if the 455,000 is what is sold to Dangote in naira alone, it is going to be major forex saving for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the cost of freight alone, it is a major saving for Nigeria. That is because if we have to go to Europe or other parts of the world to bring in petroleum products where we pay heavily in freight and in stocking those products in the high sea before we offload them, Nigerians would benefit a lot from the Dangote Refinery.\n\n\u201cThat project is one of Nigeria\u2019s backward integration programmes, and we are very proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank governor adds that the petrochemical unit of the Dangote Refinery would save the about five 5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s current import bill from the polyethene and polypropylene granules that it will be making plus another two percent from fertiliser.\n\nThe petrochemical plant will be producing 900,000 tonnes of polyethene and polypropylene granules to meet Nigeria\u2019s annual consumption of less than 200,000 with significant room for export.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is going to save five per cent of our imports. If you save five percent of your imports and another 30 per cent on petroleum products and then on the fertiliser where we would save about two percent of our imports, we are moving close to saving 40 percent of the country\u2019s imports.\n\nThe refinery is a 650,000 barrels per day integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos. It is expected to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery and the world\u2019s biggest single-train facility, upon completion",

SFM Corporate Services specialises in trust and offshore company formation services, offshore bank account opening and related services.\n\nIt was SFM Corporate Services that in turn hired Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (alcogal), a Panamanian secrecy seller, to incorporate Marlowes Trading Corporation for Mr Abiodun.\n\nAfter some back and forth between SFM and Alcogal, the offshore company was incorporated in the British Virgin Island on January 12, 2015, registration documents seen by PREMIUM TIMES showed.\n\nMr Abiodun was then appointed sole director and shareholder of the company. The businessman was also issued a share certificate number one.\n\nIn March 2015, on the completion of the registration of the company, Alcogal sent copies of the new entity\u2019s documents to SFM Corporate services in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe documents include the company\u2019s Memorandum and Articles of Association, certificate of incorporation, evidence of appointment of Mr Abiodun as first director, resolutions of the sole director adopting the company seal and authorising the issuance of shares, Share certificate No. 1 issued in favour of \u201cMr Adedapo Oluseun Abiodun\u201d, Copies of the Registers of Members and Directors and a rubber seal.\n\nThe nature of business Marlowes engages in remains unclear.

The key contact person for the firm is one Samuel Kim Oh.\n\n\u24d8\n\nHeyden in Nigeria, Heyden in tax haven\n\nApart from Marlowes, documents also show that Mr Abiodun also owns Heyden Petroleum Limited, which shares the name with a Nigerian company he also owns. He established the Nigerian version of Heyden in 2001.\n\nDetails of a letter dated March 21, 2016, showed that the governor is the sole beneficial owner of Heyden BVI.\n\nHowever, in the letter, addressed to SFM Corporate Services, Mr Abiodun notified the firm of his decision to grant one Okechukwu Chikezie Nzelum the authority to \u201chandle exclusively all administrative requests with regard to the Company.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted, however, that the said Chikeziem \u201cis not authorised to engage the company commercially.\u201d\n\nPREMIUM TIMES found that neither of the two companies was made public in the asset declaration form by Mr Abiodun upon assumption of office as Ogun State governor in 2019, in clear contravention of the provisions of the constitution.\n\nSection 11 of the fifth schedule of the Nigerian constitution states that subject to the provisions of the constitution, every public officer shall within three months after the coming into force of the Code of Conduct or immediately after taking office and thereafter, submit to the Code of Conduct Bureau a written declaration of all his properties, assets, and liabilities and those of his unmarried children under the age of eighteen years.\n\nIn sub-section 2 of the same section, the law states that: \u201cAny statement in such declaration that is found to be false by any authority or person authorised in that behalf to verify it shall be deemed to be a breach of this Code.\u201d\n\nIt thereafter declared that \u201cany property or assets acquired by a public officer after any declaration required under this Constitution and which is not fairly attributable to income, gift, or loan approved by this Code shall be deemed to have been acquired in breach of this Code unless the contrary is proved.\u201d\n\nMr Abiodun and His Foreign Account\n\nAlong with his ownership of BVI companies, documents reviewed by this newspaper showed that Mr Abiodun also runs a Swiss bank account.\n\nDetails of the Swiss bank account were seen by this newspaper in a letter forwarded by UBS AG, a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company, to SFM Corporate Services.\n\n\u24d8\n\nIn the letter, dated March 10, 2016, and signed by one Okenna Nzelu, the relationship manager, UBS affirmed that Mr Abiodun had been a client of the bank since September 2014. The bank added that the governor maintains his account \u201csatisfactorily\u201d and had no outstanding debt.\n\nUBS is based in Switzerland and co-headquartered in the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Basel. The bank maintains a presence in all major financial centres as the largest Swiss banking institution and the largest private bank in the world.\n\nSimilarly, an Ikeja Electric bill dated December 2014 was submitted by the governor, ostensibly as part of due diligence requirements for account opening and company registration.\n\nAccording to Section 7 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, certain public office holders are barred from maintaining foreign accounts.\n\n\u201cAny public officer specified in the Second Schedule to this Act or any other persons as the President may, from time to time, by order prescribe, shall not maintain or operate a bank account in any country outside Nigeria,\u201d the section states.\n\nThe constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was also explicit in its provisions.\n\nIn paragraph 3 of the fifth schedule, the constitution states that \u201cthe President, Vice-President, Governor, Deputy Governor, Ministers of the Government of the Federation and Commissioners of the Governments of the States, members of the National Assembly and of the Houses of Assembly of the States, and such other public officers or persons as the National Assembly may by law prescribe shall not maintain or operate a bank account in any country outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe game of keeping mum\n\nFor many weeks, Mr Abiodun declined to comment on PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings. Messages and emails sent to his numerous emails and phone numbers were not responded to. Messages sent to his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, were also not replied.\n\nAn associate of Mr Abiodun however told one of our reporters that the non declaration of the companies and the account was an oversight by the governor.\n\n\u201cThe governor has nothing to hide,\u201d said the official who asked not to be named because he is not Mr Abiodun\u2019s official spokesperson. \u201cHe has asked the companies to be dissolved because he no longer needs them. He did not know that it had not been done.\u201d\n\nMr Abiodun, a businessman cum politician, became Ogun governor on May 29, 2019, after several attempts to be elected to political office.\n\nIn 1998, Mr Abiodun contested and won the Ogun East Senatorial seat on the platform of the defunct United Nigeria Congress Party. The victory was, however, truncated by political developments in the country.\n\nHe later joined the Peoples Democratic Party in 1999 as a founding member on which platform he contested in the primaries for the governorship ticket in Ogun State in 2002 and lost out in the contest.\n\nIn 2015, Mr Abiodun threw himself into the Ogun East Senatorial race as the flag-bearer of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and lost yet again.\n\nIn 2018, he contested for and won the governorship ticket of the APC, culminating in his eventual victory in the general elections and emergence as the fifth elected governor of Ogun State.

          "text": "Nollywood actor, Chiwetalu Agu has said frequent attack by gunmen in Southeast part of Nigeria is easy to solve if President Muhammadu Buhari will stop all injustice and inequality.\n\nAgu, who was just released by the Department of State Services, DSS, said the quota system in place in the country would lead to nowhere.\n\n\u201cHave you heard about quota system? Is quota system good that someone from the South with a high score would not gain university admission while a candidate from the North with a lower score would gain admission ahead of me?\n\n\u201cIt is an unfair system, inequitable, unpardonable. Let everybody progress at their intelligence quotient (pace); this treatment can make some people run mad.\n\n\u201cThe attack by gunmen in the South-East is very simple to solve. It is because you are encouraging them that it is still subsisting. Let\u2019s stop all acts of injustice and inequity. Do you know how many Nigerians have left the country with their ingenuity because the country was made inconvenient for them? Uncountable.\n\n\u201cIf gunmen and other criminals are supposed to be dealt with, why have you allowed Boko Haram to operate freely for many years? Do you know how much is spent by the government? Nothing on personnel and on my progress or yours. It is all going into arms being deployed against fellow Nigerians,\u201d Agu said in an interview with The Punch.\n\nOn if he believed the killings in Southeast were being perpetrated by IPOB, Agu said: \u201cdid they do any investigation or was it guesswork? Who has ever placed its research or investigation (report) on the table to prove it is IPOB? Which IPOB members have they brought to prove their claims?\n\n\u201cAll these are conjectures they want people to believe. If it is them (IPOB), arrest them and give them lawful punishments. No criminals should be left unpunished whether from the North, South, East or West. These things were triggered, people were pushed.\n\n\u201cSo, whether it is unknown gunmen or \u2018ungun known men,\u2019 trace their involvement in any crime, then deal with it. But don\u2019t be partial; the parameters you used in the North should also be used in the South, East, West. So, people would begin to see you as being human, fair and just.\u201d\n\nHe also said the agitation for Biafra is coming because the Igbo were denied everything due to them.\n\n\u201cIf you want the Igbo man to run the affairs of the country, do not impose your ideas on him; do not intimidate him. Buhari came in 2015; have you ever seen anyone dictating to him? He does whatever he likes. I don\u2019t fail to recall when 83 persons were killed in Benue State, Governor Ortom ran to President Buhari to complain.\n\n\u201cThe President was supposed to attend the burial. Nobody is saying he should bring the dead back to life or help to bury the corpses. After that, an attempt was made on Ortom\u2019s life. As long as equity is not placed on the table, all you do is nothing. Equity must come in and the Federal Government must operate in equity and fairness.\u201d",

          "title": "Mutiu Agboke: A REC\u2019s avowed commitment to due process",
          "text": "By Emiola Adeniyi\n\nThe Oyo State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Barrister Mutiu Agboke, was in the eye of the storm lately when a splinter group within the Oyo State chapter of People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) levelled some allegations against him regarding the party\u2019s recent State Congress.\n\nAgboke was alleged to have received N10 million from the state Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, and purportedly held a meeting with the governor bordering on the conduct of the Congress.\n\nThe allegations were promptly dismissed by the REC and INEC as spurious, baseless and unfounded, and a ploy by the attention-seeking group to tarnish Agboke\u2019s good image.\n\nINEC Head of Department, Voter Education, Gender and Publicity, Mrs. Katherine Ogwu, in a statement, said the splinter PDP members resorted to campaign of calumny against the resident commissioner having failed in their bid to pressure the REC to endorse the group\u2019s activities that are clearly in contravention of party constitution, the Nigerian Constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cAgboke is a man of integrity, Honour and determination to do the right thing at all times as demonstrated by him in the last general election in 2019. There is no amount of campaign of calumny, intimidation, harassment, name dropping, spurious allegations that will intimidate him from doing the right thing,\u2019\u2019 Ogwu said.\n\nShe added that, \u201cOyo State INEC reiterates very strongly that it will not, and under no circumstances give recognition to any factional groups in any political party using INEC to validate their activities for legitimacy. What else, the faceless group has demonstrated ignorance to the effect of not knowing the mandate of Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, at relating with registered political parties and not a factional group or groups.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Barrister Agboke was never at any meeting with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Saturday, neither did he receive N10million either directly or by proxy as insinuated by these enemies of democratic norms, nor did he instruct the staff of the commission at the local government to close the office at 1pm on the day of the congress with the intention of not receiving the result of the factional group in the PDP\u201d.\n\nIn all respects, the allegations by the factional politicians did not represent the ideals that the REC is known for. Agboke is a lover of democracy, a human rights defender, a promoter of peace, a seasoned expert in conflict resolution, and an administrator per excellence.\n\nA distinguished alumnus of the University of Ilorin, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, and the Nigerian Law School, he possesses the Bachelor of Law and Master\u2019s in Law degrees respectively, and qualified as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\nAmong others, he boasts decades of work experience in legal practice and elections management. As a distinguished administrator, he has served at the state and national levels where he has and continues to make invaluable contributions to nation building.\n\nPrior to his current appointment as the INEC\u2019s REC for Oyo State, Agboke served as a Commissioner of Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC), where he distinguished himself as an unbiased umpire.\n\nRecords of his work as an electoral umpire also show that he advocates for a level-playing field for candidates seeking electoral positions. He is the rule-of-law person, and said to have zero tolerance for electoral misconduct.\n\nAt many fora, he has openly declared that he is not one to support illegality and electoral malpractice under any guise.\n\nFor instance, while addressing INEC staff during the year-end party ahead the 2019 election, he read the riot act to politicians that, under his watch as the REC in Oyo State, no one would get into an elective office through manipulation of the electoral process.\n\nOn several occasions, he has issued warnings to INEC staff that any of them that aided politicians to rig an election would face the consequences.\n\nAlso, as the guest speaker during the 2018 Annual Press Week of the Ogun State chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Abeokuta with the theme, \u2018The Media and 2019 General Elections\u2019, Agboke was unequivocal by challenging the media to remain neutral, objective and unbiased in reporting election matters.\n\nOne cannot, therefore, but condemn the PDP factional group for peddling falsehood and propaganda to rubbish the hard-earned good reputation of Barrister Agboke.\n\nIt beat sound reasoning and logic that factional PDP members could descend so low to hallucinate that Governor Makinde gave someone who is not a member of their party money just on matters of a state congress, of which the REC has no vested interest.\n\nWithout any doubt, politicking has commenced ahead of the 2023 general elections in Nigeria. Mudslinging and character pulldown are common traits of our evolving party democracy.\n\nBut firing the venomous arrow of \u2018bad-belle\u2019 politics at wrong persons, as done by the self-serving factional PDP members in Oyo State, is very worrisome.\n\nThe same Agboke was in the saddle when the 2019 general elections were conducted without record of any infraction against him, not even from the same group of PDP dissidents.\n\nIt is to the credit of Agboke that Oyo State successfully registered 19,135 eligible voters who completed their registration in the first phase of the recent nationwide Continuous Voter Registration exercise. The 19,135 registrants were those that completed their online and physical registration out of 72,644 who registered during the online pre-registration exercise.\n\nSo, where were the factional PDP politicians when the REC achieved all these remarkable results?\n\nAgboke has restated times without number that the mandate of INEC, clearly enshrined in the1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Electoral Act (as amended), was observatory because political parties\u2019 congresses, conventions and primaries are purely party affairs.\n\nIn bid to demonstrate INEC\u2019s neutrality and independence of INEC in all matters of parties\u2019 internal procedures, the REC on many occasions has warned that any INEC staff that aided politicians to subvert party\u2019s internal democratic process would face the music.\n\nPrior to the PDP Congress, he also restated that INEC would never take sides with any group on any party affair, and that the electoral body cannot be used by any politician or group to validate illegality.\n\nFor Agboke, his footprints on the sands of time across various spheres of life depict the architype of a man given to uncommon service to his community, home-state, fatherland, humanity and God\n\nThis is why plots by his detractors to lower his estimation in the eyes of right-thinking members of the society will utterly fail.\n\n-Adeniyi, a political analyst and social commentator, wrote from Ibadan, Oyo State.",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019ll lubricate businesses negatively impacted by Covid-19 \u2013 Expert \u2018\u2026Ensure reasonable return on investment, drive economic growth\u2019 \u2018\u2026SMEs can now overcome logistics, goods transportation hiccups\u2019 \u2026Apex bank must address corruption, kickbacks\u2019 challenges \u2013 Adefolarin \u2026It should create more attractive loans for SMEs \u2013 Spare parts dealer\n\nAcross the globe, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have continued to be the livewire of any industry, but in Nigeria, that is not the case as the poor state of infrastructure means SMEs haven\u2019t been able to fulfill their potential. BENJAMIN UMUTEME, in this report, examines one of the initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) aimed at reversing the trend.\n\nNigeria\u2019s battle with poor infrastructure is legendary. There was a time in the history of the country when its infrastructure was in top shape, but in the late 1980s, things began to go awry as the lack of maintenance meant that the country\u2019s infrastructure began to experience a downward spiral and presently, its poor state is making life unbearable for the citizens.\n\nOf the lot, what has suffered most is the road infrastructure. Nigeria has a fairly extensive network of roads, railroads, airports, and communication infrastructure. The road system is by far the most important element in the country\u2019s transportation network, carrying about 95 per cent of all the nation\u2019s goods and passengers. However, deliberate neglect by successive administrations meant that there has been serious damage to the economy.\n\nPrevious, current attempts\n\nDuring the Goodluck Jonathan administration, the federal government attempted to fix infrastructure with the award of N927 billion in contracts between November 2011 and September 2012. However, when the Muhammadu Buhari- led All Progressive Congress (APC) administration assumed power, it set itself to fix the country\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure. And this it has done in the six years it has been in power. As a way of matching words with action, the administration has deliberately increased allocations to capital expenditure. For instance, in the last six years, the federal government spent over N8 trillion on infrastructure and this has largely been through borrowings. In spite of the amount spent so far, infrastructure development remains grossly inadequate relative to the nation\u2019s requirements due in part to lack of funds.\n\nIt is estimated that Nigeria needs to spend about $3 billion annually for the next 10 years to address the huge infrastructure deficit that continues to stare the country in the face.\n\nCBN\u2019s initiatives\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address this long-term challenge, the CBN established the Infrastructure Finance Office on March 01, 2010. The mandate of the Office is to, among others, evolve a sustainable financing framework to stimulate long-term financing for infrastructure development in the country. The apex bank has since undertaken some steps to improve the sector as follows: The N300-billion Power and Aviation Intervention Fund (PAIF); the bank provides N300 billion facility for investment in debentures to be issued by the Bank of Industry (BoI) in accordance with Section 31 of the CBN Act 2007, for investment in power and aviation projects. The funds are to be channelled through the BoI for on-lending to deposit money banks at a maximum interest rate of 1.0 per cent for disbursement at concessionary interest rate of not more than 7.0 per cent and a tenor of 10 \u2013 15 years. At the same time, the African Finance Corporation (AFC) will serve as technical adviser to the Fund.\n\nThe N15trn InfraCo Fund\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the measures by the apex bank to further encourage banks to lend to the real sector of the economy, particularly SMEs, infrastructure and agriculture, it introduced the N15 trillion InfraCo Fund to further boost the economy. The Fund is required to support business owners such as the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as support infrastructure investment that will have a multiplier effect on growth across critical sectors.\n\nThis is coming at a time when many businesses need funds to get their mojo back as they are hampered by the lack of access to finance, inadequate infrastructure and poor digital penetration. It will also create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and preserve existing ones, thus furthering the much-applauded ambition of the Buhari-led federal government to create 100 million jobs and drastically reduce poverty in the country.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the InfraCorp Fund, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said it would help to support infrastructure investment, provide reasonable return on investment and drive medium to long-term economic growth.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cInfraCorp would enable the use of mostly private capital to support infrastructure investment that will have a multiplier effect on growth across critical sectors. The purpose of the N15 trillion being raised is to address some of our infrastructure needs while providing reasonable returns to investors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe this well-structured fund can act as a catalyst for growth in the medium and the long run. The support of the banking community will be important in achieving this objective.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 views\n\nFinancial experts have commended the apex bank\u2019s move to give fillip to the government\u2019s effort to drive development and growth of the economy by making the business environment conducive. According to them, the long-term effect will give businesses the much-needed boost that would finally set the economy on the path to sustainable growth.\n\nIn a telephone chat with this reporter, an economist, Friday Efih, said with the CBN setting aside N15 trillion to be put into Infrastructure development, the long- term effect on the economy can only be imagined.\n\n\n\n\u201cI commend the CBN for this initiative; it shows that, like Emefiele said, the CBN is a responsible bank that would do everything within its mandate to help to drive economic growth. If businesses take advantage of this window that is provided by the apex bank, the challenge of the lack of access to power, inability to access finance and poor infrastructure would die a natural death,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn his view, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, noted that the infrastructure fund would lubricate businesses that have been impacted negatively by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CBN infrastructure fund was an expansionary policy that hinges on lubricating businesses in Nigeria, especially at the advent of Covid-19 pandemic, the after effects of recessions in the country. The funds disbursement is a laudable financial inducement to boost our SMEs and allied businesses.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdefolarin further acknowledged its timeliness, stressing that it would do SMEs a world of good as it will increase their capital outlays and make available funds that will enable them to expand in stocks and machinery.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecondly, it also provides opportunities for SMEs to increase their productions and services. Thirdly, it creates the needed liquidity for SMEs to expand their market niches and cover areas of interest as well. Fourthly, the CBN infrastructure fund is strategic to SMEs in meeting up with some of the usual challenges confronting them and as well as reducing them. What comes to mind now are the challenges of electricity power, materials, equipment, machinery, rents and recruitment of the right skills and manpower.\n\n\u201cLastly, it will help SMEs to overcome logistics and transportations of goods and others.\u201d\n\nBPE\u2019s disclosures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria Bureau Statistics (NBS) data on Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) showed that SMEs contributed about 48 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP in the last five years with a total number of about 17.4 million. Also, they account for about 50 per cent industrial jobs and nearly 90 per cent of the manufacturing sectors.\n\nExperts are of the belief that while the multiplier effect of the intervention on critical sectors of the economy will be huge.\n\n\n\nWith the country\u2019s economic indices not looking good, improvements in infrastructure would lead to improved productivity thereby improving the quality of life which could ultimately lead to the eradication of the country\u2019s growing poverty.\n\nFor a spare parts dealer at Dei Dei Building Material Market, Abuja, George Agaye, the CBN\u2019s initiatives are commendable and added that the cost of borrowing for SMEs and others in the productive sector has been very high as banks do not have sufficient funds to give to investors.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for Nigeria\u2019s SMEs to access loanable funds from the CBN.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgaye said to make the initiative more effective, the CBN \u201cneeds to create more attractive loans for SMEs and the productive sector to enable them contribute immensely to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\u201d\n\n\n\nA business woman, Asabe Onuwa, hailed the apex bank\u2019s initiative, noting that given its function as a stimulator of the economy, InfraCorp will earn the current management of the bank a good rating with Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe CBN should sustain those roles and the tempo of introducing new initiatives,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his view, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Segun Ajibola, noted that several hundreds of thousands of road network, rail lines, energy and power, water and others remain critical but sadly inadequate or dilapidated.\n\n\n\n\u201cHitherto, some reliance had been placed on other sovereigns such as China, international financial institutions such as the World Bank, ADB, etc. But there is a limit to what funding Nigeria can attract from these countries and institutions because of the not-too-friendly conditionalities usually imposed on developing countries like Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking inwards in the manner being proposed by the CBN may be helpful, but then, the framework must be right. I will recommend a private partnering via collaborative arrangements between local and foreign interests adjudged competent in providing such infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAjibola, therefore, urged the apex bank to introduce a framework for monitoring performance, which must be efficient and effective, adding that there must be a shift from seeing intervention funds as free public funds, and that such mentality must be tackled head-long if the infrastructure fund could achieve the desired goals.\n\n\n\nAn expert at PwC, Habeeb Jaiyeola, noted that while infrastructure funds are used across the world for the development of critical infrastructure, which guarantees constant returns on investment for investors, a critical element of the success of the funds remains adequate planning and strategic contracting.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the N15 trillion fund is channelled into critical infrastructure in the country that will open up sectors and markets as infrastructure challenges have been one of the major factors hindering the growth of some critical sectors in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nCriteria critical\n\nFor the initiative to be a success, according to experts, those in charge should be transparent and make every process explicit.\n\n\n\nAdefolarin told this reporter that at it stands at the moment, no amount injected through the InfraCorp is too much going by the long years of neglect of SMEs.\n\n\u201cAlso, the current systemic stifling of funding in both the formal and informal sectors which resulted in deficit productive progress would be replaced by consistent funding.\n\n\n\n\u201cFurther, we are not uncritical of this initiative especially with selection processes, criteria, terms of condition and the targeted SMEs sectors. The various SMEs are segmented so it brings to fore which SMEs received more than or less. We know that the agricultural sector have been on the good book of apex bank. Other sectors like cottage industries, ICT startup, tailoring, restaurant and groceries stores, water packaging, delivery and logistics chains, traders, printing, leather production and many others. The SMEs sector is huge, so supporting them demands unlimited access and unhindered space.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nApex bank\u2019s other initiatives\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the CBN initiatives are; the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF); and Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP).\n\n\n\nOthers are Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS); Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI); Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF).\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\n\n\n\n\nAdefolarin cautioned on the need to break away from the usual business as usual and adopt a new and effective method that would make the programme a success.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor us, there is a need for improvement on the challenges the disbursement of the funds may encounter. The CBN would need to systematically institutionalise this scheme to outlive every CBN governor or regime in power; this is because SMEs must be consistently funded.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe CBN must address the challenges of corruption and kickbacks that are mostly associated with schemes going forward; it must ensure clarity, transparency, and responsibility.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for greater awareness and media campaign beyond the current arrangement. A review of the policy to ensure sustenance and continuity; avoid politicisation of the policy and ensure women and youth greater inclusion:\n\n\n\n\u201cExplore opportunities that deposit money banks, micro-finance banks and others can be involved in this same policy across Nigeria so as to expand access to credit to SMEs. This, I believe will provide the much-needed liquidity boost to the economy.\u201d",

Knowing fully well that it will be a function of the National Assembly and the Executive branch to correct the areas that has robbed Nigeria the opportunity of electing the right leaders according to the the Holy Bible and the Holy Koran that introduced self government( democracy) (Government of the people by the people for the people) on the basis of human equality.\n\n\u201cThe process was for the people to elect or select those who they have seen as virtues men and women to be elected as leaders based on their personal accomplishments which will be used to judge them by the electorate who have to decide who to entrust their Treasury and resources for a given period of time according to the constitution.\n\n\u201cThis is process has been hijacked and clueless people foisted forcefully on the offices of leadership Nationwide which had led to the collapse of the country.\u201d\n\nElekima also appreciate the selfless men and women of PLIF who contributed by no small means to the successful engagement of the legislative and executive branch, and also were able to minister the gospel to other like-minded organizations who bought the idea to help spread the crusade. No one person could have been able to do it alone.\n\nHe added that, \u201cWhile we await the assent of Mr President , we congratulate the Legislative branch for a job well done and we also thank Mr President in advance for his signing into law this Landmark amendment to the electoral act.\n\n\u201cVirtue is the ingredient of good governance. We need good men and women to build a better society. Nigeria is almost a failed State this is the opportunity and time of restoration.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026..Expands scope of nonprofit Revolving Loan Scheme to women\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation NGO, under the auspices of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has called on government at all levels to end food insecurity through the empowerment of rural women.\n\nThe group also advocates the inclusion of indigenous women, in enhancing agricultural and rural development, and eradicating rural poverty.\n\nThe President and Founder of the NGO, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made the call in a statement on Friday as part of activities to mark 2021 International Day of Rural Women IDRW, which is marked every 15th Oct to celebrate rural women all over the world.\n\nShe said this year\u2019s International Day of Rural Women with the theme: Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All\u201d was in line with the ongoing programmes being carried out by the Helpline Foundation in recent times aimed at encouraging access to food and addressing hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\n\nDr. Ahmadu, while drawing the attention of the government at all levels to rural women\u2019s plights in Nigeria, added that providing training and empowerment for rural women was in line with Helpline Foundation\u2019s plans of cushioning hardships associated with their environment.\n\nAhmadu said: \u201cOct 15th is set aside for the marking of the IDRW, the essence of the event is to create awareness on the rural women and their plights in FCT and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that rural women and girls play essential roles in food systems in Nigeria\u2013 from production, to processing, preparation, consumption, and distribution of food \u2013 as well as in securing household and community nutrition. Yet, unequal power relations between women and men in the household and society, discriminatory gender norms and practices, prevalent violence against women and girls, and their disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, result in unequal access to food and heightened experience of hunger, malnutrition, undernutrition, and food insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year being Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All , was as a result of neglect to the rural women by the policymakers, as the government does not remember them. So this awareness creation will make the government remember them, because they have a lot at hand, including problems of the upbringing of their children, among other things they are helplessly tackling.\n\n\u201cIt will surprise you to know that in some communities, they are treated unfairly and there is nobody to assist them. So for that, we are beckoning on the government at all levels to consider the widows in their policy-making. We are appealing to all the governments to consider and include them in their budgets. If this our appeals are considered, it will go a long way.\u201d\n\nOn the part of the NGO, she said \u201d We have so far embarked on periodic training and empowerment to the rural women annually across some selected communities in the six area councils of the FCT and suburbs.\n\n\u201cWhy we train and empower them is to enable them to cope with the harsh economy all over the world. Some of the rural women organisation that benefited from our empowerment programmes includes Yeyedu women, Bwari women and Kurudu women.\n\n\u201cAlso the Foundation has given out the none-profit Revolving Loan Scheme for women in our rural communities ongoing for the past 7 years respectively, where over 1000 have benefitted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, they don\u2019t have anybody to assist them, and the only way out is to train and empower them. We have trained about 1000 of them and after that, we gave them starter packs and advised them to be industrious and prudent in the management of their resources.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the ongoing training, Mrs Maria Afiniki, confirmed that she learned a lot through the training and was also empowered, even as she tasked the government to support genuine NGOs to assist rural women.",

The president, he said, therefore charged the Ministry on the harmonization of the development plans.\n\n\u201cThe two major plans developed with the assistance of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support the Ministry in coordinating development and implementation some years ago include the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Regional Development Master Plan and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs (MNDA), Niger Delta Action Plan.\n\n\u201cSuccessive efforts by other stakeholders in the region also led to the initiation of other existing development plans. Therefore the multiplicity of plans, absence of standardization and failure to manage the plans led to poor delivery of those plans and their expected outcomes,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIn actualizing the Presidential directives an initial study of the existing plans was carried out by a consultant engaged by the Ministry. This process produced a strategic document for the development of a united single plan for the region, which would be adopted as a working document for the committee,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile urging the committee to take the assignment very serious, he outlined the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the committee among others to include, reviewing the initiating framework for the Harmonization of the Development plans in the Niger Delta Region into a single coherent Regional Development Strategy.\n\nAlfred Abah, Director Planning, Research and Statistics in the Ministry, will chair the Committee, which is expected to enhance government efforts to achieve the desired development in the region. Membership of the committee is drawn from the Ministry and the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Committee while soliciting for the support of the Ministry and NDDC, assured the Permanent Secretary that the Committee does not have any reason to fail.\n\nHe said the committee would start by setting out a work plan and time line, which will produce the desired result and would not hesitate to co-opt any of the directorates when the need arises.",

          "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration on Friday said it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block a restrictive Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on abortion after a federal appeals court reinstated the law.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department will ask the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to reverse the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to lift a judge\u2019s order blocking the law, while litigation over the dispute continues, a spokesman said.\n\nThe Texas measure, which bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, took effect on Sept. 1. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe law is unusual in that it gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the state.\n\nCritics of the law have said this provision \u2013 which provides monetary awards for those whose lawsuits are successful \u2013 lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Texas over the abortion law last month, arguing that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy as recognized in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The department also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.\n\nIn his ruling blocking the law on Oct. 6, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, found that the law was likely unconstitutional and designed to avoid judicial scrutiny. The judge said he would \u201cnot sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court previously allowed the law to be enforced in a separate challenge to the ban brought by abortion providers. In that 5-4 decision on Sept. 1, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts expressed skepticism about how the law is enforced.\n\nThe Texas measure prohibits abortion at a point when many women do not even realize they are pregnant. Under the law, individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits against those who perform or help others obtain an abortion that violates the ban.\n\nThe Supreme Court already is set to consider a major abortion case on Dec. 1 in a dispute centering on Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban in which that state has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022.",

He says he did not lie about it, but he did keep it secret.\n\nThe admission comes ahead of the launch of his memoir next year.\n\nMr Miller said he had joined the Cedar Avenue gang in West Philadelphia at age 13, quickly changing from \u201ca straight-A student\u201d and drinking every day.\n\nWhen a friend was killed by a rival gang member, Mr Miller, then just 16, says he grabbed a .38 handgun, got drunk with three friends and went in search of retribution.\n\nInstead, on 30 September 1965, he fired into the chest of the first person they encountered: 18-year-old Edward White.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it even more difficult for me, because it was for no reason at all,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Miller described the decision to come clean about his past \u2013 which he has long hidden from his children, friends and closest business associates \u2013 as \u201creally difficult\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause for years, I ran from this,\u201d he told Sports Illustrated. \u201cI tried to hide this and hope that people didn\u2019t find out about it.\u201d\n\nMr Miller has been at Nike since 1997 and manages the daily operations of Nike Basketball, the Jordan Brand and Converse.\n\nHe is also a former executive at Kraft Foods and Campbell Soups, and an ex-president of the Portland Trail Blazers professional basketball team.\n\nHe says he never lied about his prison time in job applications.\n\nAhead of the interview, Mr Miller reportedly informed members of his inner circle, including basketball legend Michael Jordan and NBA commissioner Adam Silver, of the incident.\n\nHis forthcoming book \u201cJump: My Secret Journey from the Streets to the Boardroom\u201d \u2013 written in collaboration with his oldest daughter \u2013 will detail the incident, as well as his multiple stints in juvenile detention and prison over a variety of offences.\n\nNike told BBC News in a statement that Mr Miller\u2019s life was \u201can incredible story of second chances\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of Larry Miller and the hope and inspiration his story can offer,\u201d the company said, adding that it supported policies that help former prisoners \u201copen new doors of opportunity and move forward with their lives\u201d.\n\nMr Miller says he hopes his story can help steer at-risk youth away from a life of violence and inspire formerly incarcerated people to know they can still make a contribution to society.\n\n\u201cA person\u2019s mistake, or the worst mistake that they made in their life, shouldn\u2019t control what happens with the rest of your life,\u201d he said.\n\nBBC",
