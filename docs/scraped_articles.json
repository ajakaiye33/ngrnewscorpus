          "title": "AMCON reports 1,000 chronic debtors owing N3.96tn to N\u2019Assembly",
          "text": "The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria said on Friday that it had submitted a list of its top 1,000 debtors to the National Assembly as part of the strategy to intensify its debt recovery drive.\n\nAMCON put the total current exposure on all eligible bank assets at N4.4tn, saying the market values of the assets had significantly reduced below the valuation at the point of purchase due to the socio-economic downturn, making it extremely difficult to consummate sales transactions.\n\nIt said in a statement the list of the \u201crecalcitrant obligors\u201d was submitted to the members of the House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency at a retreat of the committee in Lagos.\n\nA top source told Saturday PUNCH that the 1,000 debtors were responsible for 90 per cent of the total debt of N4.4tn, translating to N3.9tn.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe 1,000 debtors are those responsible for the big-ticket debts. Many prominent Nigerians across different sectors of the economy are on the list. These people and their companies are responsible for 90 per cent of the total current exposure on all eligible bank assets put at N4.4tn.\u201d\n\nThe source added that if AMCON was able to recover the debts owed by the 1,000 top debtors, the story would be different from what it was currently.\n\nThe President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), had on Thursday signed into law the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (Amendment) Act, amending the AMCON Act No.4, 2010.\n\nThe AMCON Act provides for the extension of the tenor of the resolution cost fund and grants access to the Special Tribunal established by the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act 2020, which confers on AMCON the power to, among others, \u201ctake possession, manage, foreclose or sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal with the asset or property used as security for Eligible Bank Assets, and related matters.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency, Mr Victor Nwokolo, who received the list from the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the corporation, Mr Ahmed Kuru, was quoted as saying that the committee called for the list so that the National Assembly would knowa \u201cthose holding the country to ransom.\u201d\n\nHe said this would enable the lawmakers to meet with relevant agencies of the Federal Government on how to further deal with the debtors to ensure the realisation of AMCON\u2019s mandate in the overall interest of the Nigerian economy.\n\nNwokolo, who commended the commitment of the Kuru-led agency, said the corporation had been operating under a very difficult condition since its establishment, adding that this had been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said the harsh economic realities caused by COVID-19 meant that \u201cthe recovery assignment AMCON is doing for the country has been further compounded, which is why the National Assembly is looking at ways of further supporting the recovery drive.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly is considering punitive measures in dealing with those whose names made the top 1,000 AMCON debtors\u2019 list.\n\nHe said he was happy Buhari had signed the amended AMCON Act into law as it would help the corporation to recover the huge outstanding debt and ensure the achievement of the Federal Government\u2019s aim of setting up AMCON in 2010.\n\nWhile presenting the list, Kuru said, \u201cTo enable AMCON to succeed in its national call to duty, AMCON solicits the continued support of this distinguished committee.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary must be encouraged to respect the provisions of the law that require them to fast-track cases before them, issue certificate of judgement on properties, which the corporation has no collateral and demand debtors to deposit judgment sum before proceeding to appeal any judgement.\u201d\n\nKuru said the judiciary had been of tremendous support, adding that the corporation\u2019s recovery drive \u201cis heavily dependent on the judiciary in the country because AMCON has over 4,000 cases in court.\u201d\n\nHe said the corporation was challenged with so many issues, including unperfected title documents of some properties from eligible financial institutions, which often prevent or elongate the completion of the sale of some of the assets.\n\nAnother issue, according to him, is a general market perception that AMCON assets are distressed; hence buyers request for deeply discounted prices, and the basis for the pricing of EBAs at the point of purchase was the valuation of the assets.\n\nKuru added that with the support of the National Assembly and the judiciary, recovering the total current exposure on all EBAs might be possible before the corporations\u2019 sunset period.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "*Says demand runs contrary to separation of power\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, told some Igbo leaders that met him to demand for the unconditional release of the leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, that the demand was heavy for him.\n\nHowever, the President assured his guests that he will consider their demand.\n\nThe IPOB leader, Mazi Kanu, is currently standing trial at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe President met the Igbo leaders on the platform of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, at the grey room close to his main office at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nHe told the 93-year-old statesman and his entourage that the demand they made was an extremely difficult demand on him as leader of the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, said though the demand was heavy, he will consider it.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the judiciary.\n\n\u201cGod has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already.\n\n\u201cBut the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system.\n\n\u201cLet him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Chief Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\n\u2026 as Amaechi laments South-East economy\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the South-East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that businesses have collapsed, education is crumbling, and there is fear everywhere.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nChief Amaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country.\n\n\u201cI believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nRoll call\n\nOther people in the visiting delegation were a former governor of Anambra State, His Excellency Chukwuemeka Ezeife; Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church; Chief Barrister Goddy Uwazurike, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, and Mr Tagbo Mbazulike Amaechi.\n\nAlso present at the meeting were the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; the Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu; the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, and the National Security Adviser, NSA, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd).\n\nIt will be recalled that the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami recently said that exploring political solution in the IPOB and Nnamdi Kanu issue was not foreclosed.\n\nThe leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo, the former Deputy President of the Senate, Dr. Ike Ekweremadu, South-East monarchs and the religious leaders from the zone were among those that have canvased for political solution in the IPOB imbroglio.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has confirmed the return of N19. 33 billion Kogi state salary bailout funds, recovered by the Commission, to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nSpokesperson for EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja, on Friday.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the money was meant for the payment of Kogi state workers, but was allegedly domiciled in an interest-yielding account with Sterling Bank plc.\n\nThe Kogi state government, through the Commissioner for Finance, Budget and Economic Planning, Asiwaju Idris Asiru, denied knowledge of the fixed deposit account with the said bank.\n\nNAN also reports that the EFCC has withdrawn its suit seeking the forfeiture of the N20 billion bailout funds granted to the Kogi state government by Sterling Bank.\n\nUwujaren said the return of the money to the CBN would effectively put to rest the campaign of misinformation and unconscionable denials by the Kogi state government that no funds were recovered from its bail out account.\n\nHe added that the CBN in a letter referenced, DFD/DIR/CON/EXT/01/099 and dated Nov. 9, 2021, confirmed to the EFCC Chairman, Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, that it had received the money.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cWe refer to your letter dated Nov. 5, 2021 with Ref. No: CR:3000/EFCC/LS/CMU/REC-STE/VOL.4/047 on the above subject and wish to confirm the details of the receipt of the amount as stated below: Bank: Sterling Bank Plc; Amount: N19, 333, 333,333.36; Date of receipt: 04 Nov., 2021.\n\n\u201cThe return of the money to the apex bank is in compliance with the Oct. 15, 2021 order of a Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe court directed the unfreezing of the Kogi state salary bail-out account to enable Sterling Bank to remit the balance in the account to the CBN.\n\n\u201cJustice Chukwujekwu Aneke gave the order pursuant to an application filed by the EFCC, \u201d he said.\n\nUwujaren added that the commission had told the court that the management of Sterling Bank Plc, where the account was domiciled, had acknowledged the existence of the said account with the staggering sum in its books.\n\n\u201cThe Commission further brought to the attention of the court that the said amount is still standing in the credit of the account frozen.\n\n\u201cThe management of Sterling Bank PIc, has, pursuant to a letter dated Sept. 15, 2021, signed by its Managing Director, indicated its intention to return the total amount back to CBN, \u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that the EFCC prayed the court that it \u201cis expedient for the instant suit to be discontinued and the account unfrozen\u201d.\n\nThis was to enable the management of Sterling Bank effect the transfer/ return of the sum of N19, 333, 333, 333.36 back to the coffers of the CBN, from where the said bailout funds were disbursed.\n\nThe transfer, according to Uwujaren, has put a stop to any further controversy regarding the source and ownership of the funds and most importantly, aborted the funds dissipation.\n\nJustice Tijani Garba Ringim, a vacation Judge, had on Aug. 31, 2021, ordered the freezing of the account, following an ex-parte application filed by the EFCC.\n\nThe EFCC, in a 13-paragraph affidavit in support of the ex-parte application, had stated that it received a credible and direct intelligence, which led to the tracing of the funds reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities in account No. 0073572696 domiciled in Sterling Bank, with the name of Kogi State Salary Bailout Account.\n\nAfter listening to the EFCC\u2019s application, Justice Ringim on Aug. 31, 2021, ordered the freezing of the account and directed the publication of the order in a national newspaper by the EFCC.",

Ugwuanyi disclosed his administration has been able to continue to play the role through provision of robust infrastructure; peaceful and secure operating environment for business and investment; consistent and favourable policies; and facilitation of all bureaucratic processes required for starting and doing business \u201cthrough our One-Stop Investment-Centre (OSIC) under the Enugu State Investment Development Authority (ESIDA)\u201d.\n\nThe governor added that the role his administration has continued to play as a business and investment enabler was also achievable through \u201cfriendly tax regime and professional regulatory oversight as significant co-factors for investment inflow\u201d.\n\nSpeaking during the ground-breaking of the Godfrey Okoye (GO) University-European Business Park, Centre for Practical Skills and Start-Ups, Gov. Ugwuanyi described the outfit as \u201ca public-private initiative with unique value proposition for economic expansion, skill infusion, job creation and wealth creation for our people\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that considering challenges of the younger generation which traverse underemployment, unemployment and unemployability due to inadequacy of opportunities as well as poverty of skills because of non-functional education, the emerging digital economy governed by disruptive technologies including the Blockchain, makes the Godfrey Okoye University Business Park initiative both visionary and compelling.\n\nOn his administration\u2019s progress in investment development and innovation, Gov. Ugwuanyi revealed: \u201cOur administration, mindful of the rapidly changing world order, organized the first-ever Enugu State Investment Summit in 2016 (Oganiru Enugu) wherein we opened up Enugu State to investors and showcased the investment opportunities in the state\u201d.\n\nHe maintained that the progress is \u201cself-evident in the leapfrogging of our state from its 2014 World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking as 27th out of 37 states (including FCT, Abuja), to the 2nd most improved state in the 2018 World Bank Ease of Doing Business subnational ranking\u201d.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cwe have birthed the Lion Business Park, a pioneering instance of an audacious public-private partnership project in the South East Zone that promises to transform the economy of the region.\n\n\u201cWe have also established two Enugu State Tech Hubs and Youth Innovation Centres (Enugu and Obollo Afor) to infuse technology knowledge and skills in our youths thereby supporting creativity, innovation, start-ups, product acceleration and wealth creation for them. These are intended to create jobs and wealth for young people and transit them out of deviant behaviours.\n\n\u201cThese modest efforts are beginning to get due recognition as Enugu has been reckoned as the top five Start-up cities in Nigeria and top 978 Start-up cities globally by the Global Start-Up Eco-System Index 2021 report\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on his nomination and shortlisting of institutions of the state government for the conferment of the coveted awards of ICT Governor of the Year, Tech Innovation Hub of the Year (Mentoring and Capacity Building) and Emerging Leader in Science, Tech and Innovation (STI) Advisory (Public Sector) for the prestigious 2021 Nigeria Tech Innovation and Telecom Awards (NTITA) holding in Lagos on Friday, Gov. Ugwuanyi said: \u201cFor these and many more, we continue to thank the Almighty God for his love and faithfulness\u201d.\n\nThe governor congratulated the Vice-Chancellor of GO University, Prof. Christian Anieke, as well as the management, staff and students of the University, and acknowledged the funding partners for the project, Austrian Development Bank, European Investment Bank and German Government as well as the investing private sector player, Umuchinemere Procredit Micro Finance Bank, for having faith in the laudable project.\n\nHe assured them of the favourable Tech Eco-system of Enugu and a friendly business environment.",

          "text": "On Tuesday, November 16, 2021, at the main Auditorium of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, the 10th edition of the Zik Lecture series was staged to commemorate the birthday of the first President of Nigeria and one of the founding fathers of the country, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. The star attraction was Dr. Kayode Fayemi, the Governor of Ekiti State and Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2018 Forum (NGF), who was the Guest Speaker.\n\nThe general theme of the lecture centred on Security, Governance and Nation Building. But Governor Fayemi spoke specifically on \u201cNation Building: Between Restructuring and Autonomy\u201d. Fayemi who holds a doctorate degree on War Studies did not disappoint. His presentation was thought-provoking as it was engaging and intellectually stimulating. He kept the Auditorium which was filled to its capacity spellbound with his expositions and postulations on the way forward for our beleaguered country currently besieged on all fronts by centrifugal forces.\n\nThe guest lecturer commenced the brilliant presentation by paying glowing tribute and befitting homage to the memory of Zik of Africa, the great Pan-Africanist who led the nationalist movement in Nigeria and decolonization of the continent. Dr. Fayemi also went deep into the archives to refresh his esteemed audience on the pragmatic roles played the great Zik alongside such iconic historical figures like W.E. Dubois and George Padmore in the Black Movement to give the black man a respectable place in a world dominated by the white Caucasians.\n\nHe also noted how Zik inspired a generation of African leaders like Kwame Nkrumah and Mwalimu Julius Nyerere in the struggle for the liberation of Africa from the clutches of imperialism and neo-colonialism. Fayemi informed the gathering how Zik, through his group of newspapers and writings campaigned vigorously for the mental and political emancipation of the continent. Fayemi accurately noted that Zik\u2018s book, Renascent Africa, published in 1937 was path-breaking as it gave intellectual impetus to the Pan-Africanist movement. In that powerful book, the great Zik postulated five constructs through which Africa can attain a pride of place amongst the continents of the world. Those constructs include what Zik called \u2018mental emancipation, social regeneration, cultural revivalism, economic determinism and political risorgimento\u2019. Through his works, he was able to mobilize the people of Africa in the struggle for economic and political freedom.\n\nRead Also: Fayemi to deliver NIJ convocation lecture\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFayemi noted that Zik, more than any of his contemporaries, worked assiduously to build a united Nigeria in which every citizen or group would be free to realize its full potentials and aspirations without let or hindrance. He recalled all the various unifying roles Zik played in the life of the nation, adding that Zik was never a captive of tribe; rather he believed in a united and bigger Nigeria. He was thus propelled by that larger picture in all his politics. There is no doubt that the liberal American education which Zik acquired while he sojourned in the United States was the underlying factor that defined the worldview of the celebrated African statesman in whose memory and honour the Zik Lecture series was instituted by the University in Awka named after him.\n\nDrawing from the rich experiences of Zik and what he stood for in Nigeria and Africa, Fayemi noted strongly that the lot of Nigerians would be better served in a united entity. He, therefore, cautioned against separatist agitations, as such campaigns have continued to result in needless deaths, pains and destructions. In his words: \u201cThere is absolutely nothing heroic about dying foolishly for a cause for which dialogue and negotiation can provide pathways to workable solutions. Whatever is worth fighting for is worth staying alive for\u201d.\n\nFayemi believes that the best way to go is dialogue, especially in a heterogeneous and complex country like Nigeria. For him, restructuring the country offers the best solution to the problems that have continued to assail Nigeria\u2018s efforts at nation building. He noted as follows: \u201cIf separation and secession are not as easy or simple as their proponents imagine, and given that they do not provide any guarantee that a better future can be secured through them, the demands for a national restructuring would seem to me to be worth keeping on the table for deeper consideration. In doing so, we have a duty to frame and contextualize the quest for restructuring as part of a normal process of regular and periodic adjustment and recalibration of governance arrangements to changing times and contexts\u201d.\n\nGovernor Fayemi could not have put it better. Restructuring Nigeria, I believe, will help us to overcome the underlying factors that feed into the clamour for secession and self-determination. The country as it is presently configured is skewed heavily in favour of some ethno-religious groups in the country. The evident marginalization and political exclusion of the South East Zone are the underlying factors that propel the agitations in the Zone. Like Fayemi correctly noted, separatism and secession cannot be a realistic solution, especially in the light of the misfortune that has befallen such a country like South Sudan which has not known peace and development since it separated from Sudan in 2011. Other unsavoury experiences Fayemi cited include Burundi and Somalia which, in spite of their cultural homogeneity, have remained theatres of conflicts.\n\nThe takeaway from the lecture is that we, as a people, are better off in a united and restructured Nigeria in which every part of the country will be free to pursue its aspirations without let or hindrance. The agitations will cease the moment the Government of the day shows good faith and sincerity of purpose by initiating a national dialogue with all aggrieved groups with a view to reworking the terms of the union and ensuring equity and balance in the Federation.",

          "text": "Events and happenings in the world at large this week show vividly that some time tested and well known ideas and values are taking on new meanings and metamorphosing into new ideas right before our eyes .You may say they are lost in plain sight but it is their impact on global diplomacy , the balance of power in a new evolving world order and the threat and import of that to global peace that attracts our attention today . The signals are there beaming and fluctuating like a traffic light at a road junction and the prevailing color is not green or amber . It is plain bloody red and that is no exaggeration as I shall show carefully today with some vivid illustrations .\n\nOn the global scene , first look at the Belarus and Poland border and the scene showing locked out illegal migrants throwing stones at the police and army of the nation they want to migrate to resisting them and you sense that this is not a n ordinary migration but a hostile invasion. Compare this with the US Mexico border where former President Trump built a wall to stem the tide of illegal migration and on which his successor reneged and welcomed illegal migrants with financial incentives and no vaccine or covid testing and you again see that this is an orchestrated invasion approved by the US government and is not an ordinary migration . Also this week the leaders of China and US met in a virtual summit and it was clear who had the upper hand on the personal and diplomatic front especially on the dicey issue of Taiwan\u2019s Independence . In Nigeria the House Reps passed a resolution asking the army to change strategy to confront the terrorist effrontery of the Islamic State in West Africa Province \u2013ISWAP \u2013 when it is an open secret that Nigeria has always had an open , uncontrollable border right from the creation of the North East state in the mid 1970s , well before the government , a military one , created six unviable states that have been invaded by so called migrants now under the force of arms confronting government in not only the NE. They are marauding and raiding the NW , North Central and Middle Belt in the form or guise of armed herdsmen who are more or less the strong vanguard of an invasion force which some government sources have branded as aliens from God knows where and not bona fide Nigerians . In the news on CNN the cable network is hard at work to portray the Jan 6 Capitol Insurrection 2021 as a coup simply because its analysts do not know the significance of coups as they have never seen one but aim to damage further the image of their 45th president that they afraid may resurrect in the 2024 presidential elections which they think and boast will happen over their dead bodies .\n\nI will now proceed to give my perceived consequences of all these events and situations in brief before giving the reasons that I think gave rise to them. It is like putting the cart before the horse but I am in a hurry to discharge the alarm in my head as well as the cargo in my mind on these issues and will ride the horse comfortably in front of the cart later .\n\nFirst the Belarus- Poland border stand of has shown that migration can be weaponised in international relations amongst nations with conflicting interests or at dispute with each other . The open border issue of the Biden Administration has shown that migrants can be used as cannon fodder to get votes and political power later regardless of the security risks involved now and in the immediate future . The way the Chinese leader greeted his American leader as an \u2018 old friend \u2018 at the beginning of their virtual meeting showed that the US is beholden to China under the Biden Administration and Biden\u2019s double talk on Taiwan Independence and security showed that the US will betray Taiwan on the issue of defence and Independence like it marooned its allies when it fled Afghanistan and abandoned it to the Taliban . The call by the Nigerian House of Reps on the army to contain the menace of ISWAP is like barking at the moon as it is clear the army is running out of ideas on how to contain the invasion of NE by not only ISWAP but also Boko Haram and the omens on this are not that good .\n\nRead Also: TRUMPing democracy\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWith regard to the frenzy on CNN to make the Jan 6 Insurrection look like a coup or the worst thing to happen to US democracy and in the process making Donald Trump a potential treasonable felony candidate for an imagined guillotine , the CNN should not throw caution to the winds in its own very interests . It has a credibility problem on the Russia story that is unraveling now as fake news that it used from day one to attack the Trump Administration falsely . The faces on show at CNN are quite familiar . They are the same anti Trump cast and I feel sorry for their hatred for their former president whose potential for presidential resurrection in 2024 is why they are calling the Jan 6 2021 issue a coup . It is another fake news , a name that rattled CNN no end when Trump first used it and it stuck effectively in his highly controversial one term presidency . I have given the reason here now ,let me do the same for the other issues .\n\nOn the Belarus- Poland migrants issue it is Belarus allowing migrants from Iraq , Syria and the Middle East access maliciously through its territory to Poland in retaliation for sanctions against Belarus by the EU for rigging the last Belarus presidential elections and suppressing protests and opposition violently . Poland is a gate way to the EU and is the proxy for Belarusian vendetta or retaliation against EU economic sanctions on this score .\n\nWith regard to the Chinese leader calling Biden an old friend it is apparent that they have met before and not the first time . Hunter Clay , Bidens son had dubious business transactions with the Chinese which were suppressed during the 2020 presidential election by the liberal media till it was sure Trump had lost the elections .It is obvious the Chinese leader knows he has the American president by the balls and that can be used to make America play ball like Biden capitulated on the Taiwan issue and left the mud cleaning to his lieutenants later .\n\nOn the issue of Boko Haram , ISWAP and the inability of the army to contain them , a change not only of strategy but orientation, collaboration and perception is necessary . Nigeria needs to team up with the leader of France who has a more serious problem on his hand as France has the largest Muslim population in France and President Emmanuel Macron is committed to making France a secular state and French Muslims are being made by force and guile to adapt and live in a secular state . The opposite is happening in Nigeria where jihadism is being treated with kid gloves and Boko Haram and ISWAP are waxing stronger . France has a fighting force in the Sahel because it believes Islamic terrorism is being hatched and exported to EU and France from there . Amnesty International tried to blackmail the French forces recently but the French general saw through their false alarm and told them they are in league with the Islamic forces terrorizing the Sahel which includes our NE and NW . We should team up with the French in combatting Islamic terrorism both within and without the Sahel in Nigeria. A word is enough for the wise",

The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Chief Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the Southeast as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that businesses have collapsed, education is crumbling, and there is fear everywhere.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying,\u201d stressing that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nOther people in the visiting delegation were; His Excellency Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former Governor of Anambra State, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Chief Barrister Goddy Uwazurike, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, and Mr Tagbo Mbazulike Amaechi.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. The Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nOn the recent removal of Nigeria from the watchlist of countries violating religious freedom, which Blinken said was \u201cbased on facts,\u201d Buhari expressed the country\u2019s appreciation, noting that there was freedom of worship in Nigeria, and no one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith.\n\nHe said education is a priority in the country, \u201cbecause when you educate a people, there are certain levels they will not fall below.\u201d\n\nThe president equally appreciated the US for allowing Nigeria to procure military hardware to fight terrorism in the country, and for the training given to the Nigerian military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilise the situation in the North East, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015. We are doing a lot on security, and the people involved appreciate our efforts.\u201d\n\nOn the development of democratic ethos, the president said Nigeria has adopted the American model, \u201chook, line, and sinker, with its term limits. Those who have attempted to breach it were disappointed, if not disgraced. You are even lucky, if you have two terms. Others try hard and don\u2019t get it. The American model has been accepted by Nigerians as the best.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that Nigeria and her neighbours, have been living with the impact of climate change for a while, which has seen Lake Chad shrink drastically from its original size, and affected the livelihood of about 30 million people in the Lake Chad Basin countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why the youths defy the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to attempt emigrating to Europe. Inter-basin water transfer is needed to keep the youths at home, and they can resume their lives of farming, fishing, and animal husbandry,\u201d he said.\n\nBlinken, who had held a virtual meeting with the Nigerian President earlier in the year, said jocularly that it was now good to see him \u201cmask to mask, hoping we will soon see face to face.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the contributions of President Buhari to the protection of the climate, particularly his presence and contributions at the recent COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nBlinken said America and Nigeria have diverse challenges, but a common denominator is security, and hoped for better partnerships, \u201cso that the bad guys won\u2019t get the good guys.\u201d\n\nHe described the report of the EndSARS probe panel as \u201cdemocracy in action,\u201d stressing that America equally had its own police brutality and hoped that necessary reforms would be made.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*US seeks proper accountability of findings\n\n*Govt\u2019s lawyer disputes panel\u2019s leaked report, doubts casualty figures\n\n*Identifies 40 discrepancies in document, N800m spent on panel\u2019s 13 months sitting\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja, Nume Ekeghe and Wale Igbintade in Lagos in Lagos\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the federal government would not take any action to block or anticipate the outcomes of the various panels set up by state governments to investigate last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests.\n\nRather, Buhari said his government would wait to see the steps the governors would take before considering any action on the outcomes of the inquiries.\n\nThe nationwide protests in October last year had resulted in loss of lives and wanton destruction of property.\n\n\n\nBuhari, who spoke during a meeting with United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken,in Abuja, said his administration was inclined to allow the system work, and that the state governments would be required to take steps to address the issues raised in the panels\u2019 reports before the federal government would step in.\n\nBut the United States government, which has since shown interest in the #EndSARS matter, said it would like to see that both the federal and the Lagos State governments ensured that the report of the panel received due accountability and attention.\n\nHowever, counsel to the Lagos State government on the #EndSARS panel, Mr. Abiodun Owonikoko (SAN), has rejected the findings of the panel, which were leaked on Monday. Owonikoko also disputed the casualty figures recorded by the panel.\n\nHe claimed the leaked document was fraught with discrepancies and should not be in the public domain or be taken as an accurate document, especially, as one of the signatories to the document, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), was absent for the most part of the hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, sources close to Alausa, the seat of the Lagos State government, said the government spent N800 million to fund the #EndSARS inquiry, which lasted 13 months.\n\nBuhari was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, that, \u201cSo many state governments are involved, and have given different terms of reference to the probe panels.\n\n\u201cWe at the federal have to wait for the steps taken by the states, and we have to allow the system to work. We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. The federal government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nThe president told the US Secretary of State that his administration remained committed to freedom of worship, adding, \u201cNo one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith.\u201d\n\nHe expressed his appreciation to the US for the sale of weapons to Nigeria to fight insecurity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilise the situation in the North-east, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nBut Blinken, who spoke at a joint press conference with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at the State House, Abuja, charged the governments to see to it that the grievances of victims of security agents\u2019 brutality were attended.\n\nBlinken, who had held separate meetings with Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and Onyeama, during which some agreements were signed, also noted that his country was working with Nigeria to address its security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with Nigeria to address security challenges, including those posed by Boko Haram, ISIS West Africa and other terrorist and extremist groups. In meetings with the President, with the Vice President, with the foreign minister, we discussed the importance of a comprehensive approach that builds effective security forces, addresses the underlying drivers of extremism, and respects Nigerians\u2019 basic human rights.\n\n\u201cThe United States is committed to helping Nigeria do that by continuing to invest in our security partnership, and the institutions that strengthen the rule of law, and that hold accountable those, who commit human rights abuses, corruption and other acts that harm the Nigerian people. By tackling these issues, we can help to address some of the problems that have been key drivers of insecurity.\n\n\u201cTo that end, let me say that we welcome the conclusion of the investigation by the independent inquiry established by the Lagos State government to look into the events that took place at Lekki Tollgate in Lagos, in October of 2020, and this, of course, was amidst the #EndSARS protest, including the killings and other alleged abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate and look to the state and the federal government\u2019s response to the findings, and expect those to include steps that ensure accountability and address the grievances of the victims and their families.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working closely with Nigeria to help the populations most affected by conflict and violence in the country, particularly in the Northeast, where the United States is providing vital humanitarian aid to approximately 2.2 million internally displaced Nigerians. United States continues to build the capacity, together with Nigeria, of the military, including through the recent delivery of 12 A29 Super Tucano aircrafts, but capacity building goes much deeper than delivering military hardware, something that we talked about as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also providing more human rights and rule of law training, because military and civilian security forces are more effective, when they act in accordance with these values. And because it\u2019s crucial that Nigeria holds accountable members of the military, who commit abuses,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to charge government to ensure the safety and wellbeing of groups involved in human rights advocacy, such as journalists, rights crusaders and others.\n\n\u201cJournalists, human rights defenders and others, Nigeria\u2019s very vibrant civil society are playing a vital role in shining a spotlight on these and other issues. Their ability to exercise freedom of expression and other basic human rights is crucial to advocating for individuals and communities and strengthening this country\u2019s vibrant democracy as we\u2019ve seen in the successful efforts to promote electoral reform, and lower the age at which Nigerians can run for office.\n\n\u201cI look very much forward to meeting several of these leaders tomorrow (today), including faith leaders, who are defusing communal tensions, and promoting peace. And we look forward to Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest democracy joining the summit for democracy next month. All participants from government, civil society will make commitments to improve and strengthen democracy in our respective countries and strengthen the partnership among democratic nations.\n\n\u201cThe range of issues that we\u2019re working on together is vast, but given the interests we share, and the challenges we have in common, delivering for our people demands that we find ways to deepen our existing ties and partnerships even further. That\u2019s ultimately what this visit and the work that we\u2019re doing every single day, between our governments between our people is,that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking about partnering in various areas, he said besides the 7.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines recently delivered at no cost to Nigeria, more would be delivered before the end of the year, citing other areas of collaboration between the two countries.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, working together to beat back COVID-19 and to build back better as we address the devastating impact that it\u2019s had on all of us, on our communities, on our economies. The United States has delivered 7.6 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to Nigeria, and we expect to send another significant number of doses by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cDonated with no strings attached. And we\u2019re providing significant aid to save lives right now. From the more than 150 testing labs that we have to set up nationwide to helping tackle food security crisis that was worsened by the pandemic. We have teamed up for a long time to confront epidemics and to improve public health. In that sense, this is not new.\n\n\u201cThe United States and others work with Nigeria toward eliminating a wild polio virus, supporting vaccination campaigns, aiding surveillance to detect and isolate cases. That collaboration was key to the country being certified free of the virus in August of 2020. That\u2019s a huge achievement. Reckon assistance is helping to bring treatment to more than one and a half million people in Nigeria living with HIV AIDS, and we\u2019re on track for epidemic control by 2023.\n\n\u201cOur support for primary health care helps provide vital services to more than 60 million Nigerians. These other and efforts have helped create a robust infrastructure for Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response and broader efforts to strengthen public health security, which are essential to detect and prevent the next pandemic.\n\n\u201cSecond, we\u2019re working with Nigeria to build back better from the pandemic by fostering inclusive sustainable economic growth. That\u2019s the goal of the 2 billion development agreement that Jeffrey and I just signed, and which will make I think, significant investments in improving access to quality education, public health and other services and tools that Nigeria\u2019s rising generations are looking for, and need to thrive here at home and in the global economy. And we\u2019re committed to working with the government as it pursues economic reforms, for example, to create a more stable regulatory environment to attract more foreign investment.\n\n\u201cThird, working together to address the global climate crisis. Foreign Minister and I were both just at COP 26, where President Buhari made significant new commitments to join the global methane pledge and build on the progress that Nigeria has made in solar power.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial as more and more Germans feel the impact of the crisis, something the President, I must say, talked about very eloquently, when we were together a short while ago, and displaced people, who have lost connections with their livelihoods as a result of climate change among other disruptions.\n\n\u201cOur work together also demonstrates how tackling this crisis represents an opportunity, our once in a generation opportunity to create good paying jobs and expand renewable energy access.\n\n\u201cThe USAID has a five-year $110 million project, the Nigeria power sector programme, and that\u2019s supporting key initiatives like the solar power major, which will bring solar energy to 25 million Nigerians, who are off the electric grid and lack access to power.\n\n\u201cThat, in turn, is expected to create as many as 250,000 new jobs in the energy sector, spur local industry, generate 18 and a half million dollars in annual tax revenues. So, it will have practical, meaningful effects,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe also expressed the United States\u2019 displeasure at the turn of events in Sudan, saying, \u201cLet me just say one brief word about yesterday\u2019s events in Sudan. The United States is deeply concerned by the violence used by the Sudanese military against people engaged in peaceful protest, which reportedly killed more than a dozen civilians and wounded scores more.\n\n\u201cThe military must respect the rights of civilians to assemble peacefully and express their views. And we continue to support the demand of the Sudanese people for the restoration of the civilian-led transition, and including the return of Prime Minister, Abdala Hamdok, back to office and the immediate release of all those detained since October 25,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Owonikoko, who spoke on the ARISE News Morning Show, a breakfast programme yesterday, stated that from the evidence gathered, there was no record of a single death.\n\n\u201cI am totally shocked about what I read to be in the report, particularly, the findings with regard to 48 victims some of whom are described as deceased and missing,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHe explained that it was unacceptable for a member of the panel to publicly disclose the contents of the panel\u2019s report, insisting that the panellists took an oath of fidelity with respect to impartiality and confidentiality.\n\nAccording to Owonikoko, \u201cIf anybody, who was a panel member has gone out as of today to speak to what has happened, that person has breached not only the oath he took to be a member, he has also breached the duty imposed on him not to discuss or divulge the contents to anybody. What we should be discussing, and this is very important, will be the government\u2019s own outcome. That outcome can be criticised.\u201d\n\nHe added that the panel comprised mostly people with no legal background, and this accounted for most of the alleged breaches of the law by members.\n\nOwonikoko alleged that there were at least 40 discrepancies in the report released by the panel, concluding that the members did not do a thorough job.\n\nHe stated, \u201cA number of them were not lawyers. And that, to me, actually, is the crux of the problem we have with this report. From the evidence that we were able to gather at the hearing, there was not a single death that was established.\n\n\u201cThe mistake I have observed is that the government made it in such a way that it should have been a different panel entirely to look into the Lekki incidents. The panel that was considered originally was meant to address victims of abuse of police brutality and SARS. So, from the very beginning, that panel lacked the judicial competency to determine these issues.\u201d\n\nOwonikoko stated that Adegboruwa, who was the representative of the civil society on the panel, had recused himself long before the report came out and had not been in most of the panel meetings. He urged that the report should not be considered valid.\n\nOwonikoko stated, \u201cThat report is already tainted and I would not expect the government not to be cautious in implementing that kind of report. I want to know how that gentleman (Adegboruwa) was able to sign off on this report as an objective and neutral report of facts that you are trying to find. He ought not to participate, because in this report, for almost 15 sittings, he did not come.\u201d\n\nInsisting that the report was not against the Lagos State government as such, Owonikoko stated that the only part that concerned the government was whether it ordered the deployment of soldiers. He also pointed out that during the entire proceedings of the panel, there was no evidence that the army was deployed by the governor, noting that ordinarily, the report would be subjected to a judicial review.\n\nThe lawyer explained that part of the discrepancies in the report was that even someone, who allegedly testified before the panel, was declared dead in the report. He said the discrepancies did not project the panel as having done a thorough job, expressing shock that such report should be released in the public space.\n\nOwonikoko explained, \u201cI have read the report. Since you now confirm that it is supposed to be authentic, I have identified almost 40 discrepancies, very material discrepancies in that report, including awarding damages to people, who are claimed to have died.\n\n\u201cPeople, who never died, who have even come out to say they did not die, including awarding damages to somebody they claim died but who actually was a witness to testify as to his brother\u2019s death not even at Lekki toll gate.\n\n\u201cDoes that not show you that there was no thorough job done? How do you make that kind of serious mistake, to award millions and millions to somebody claiming that he died when actually he was even a witness before you?\n\n\u201cIn the report itself, you will find where the witness was there and they recorded his evidence, and in the list they posted, they said he died and awarded him N15 million. What kind of report is that? That alone, any report that has that fundamental error will be crushed.\u201d\n\nDrawing a convergence between the Justice Oputa panel and the Okuwobi panel, Owonikoko argued that even if a white paper was released on the matter, it was not binding on anybody.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYou are entitled to subject it to the judicial review in a court of law. An instance that you may readily recall was the Oputa panel. One of the reasons a number of the recommendations did not see the light of day was that it was challenged in court and the Supreme Court held that some of the matters that the panel looked into, as much as the public was interested in knowing the truth about them, were beyond the remit of the federal government to constitute a panel to look into.\n\n\u201cI am not speaking on a report that is validly published and which can be authenticated as the outcome of that judicial inquiry. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t pretend not to be aware that certain documents have been circulating in the social media and have been subject of comments and responses.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the report released to the public was even unsigned, adding that it might well be a minority report.\n\nEmphasising that he had issues with Adegboruwa, whom he said was consistently absent during Saturday sittings on the Lekki incident, Owonikoko noted that the civil society representative lacked the moral right to have signed the document.\n\n\u201cThis same gentleman (Olu-Adegboruwa) had no legal or moral right to sign the report but he did,\u201d Owonikoko said.\n\nThe Lagos State counsel further said there was no place in the report that mention was made of an attempt to attack a traditional ruler and raze down Oriental Hotel at Lekki by hoodlums during the protest.\n\nThe leaked report had noted that there was an \u201catrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting #EndSARS protesters, while sitting on the floor, waving the Nigerian flags, and singing the National Anthem, and therefore concluded that it amounted to a \u2018massacre\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt said the security forces killed some 11 protesters while over 40 were injured, contrary to claims by the army and the Lagos State government that protesters were not killed.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers actually shot blank and live bullets directly and pointedly into the midst of the protesters at the Lekki tollgate, with the deliberate intention to assault, maim and kill. The soldiers turned back ambulances that were invited to render first aid and assistance to the wounded protesters,\u201d the report read.\n\nThe leaked report further stated that there were attempts to cover-up the killings, including soldiers picking up bullet shells on the night of October 20, 2020 and policemen following up in the morning of October 21 to pick bullet shells. It added that that LCC officials manipulated the CCTV cameras.\n\nBut the army had claimed that soldiers deployed to the Lekki tollgate only shot blank bullets into the air and operated within the rules of engagement. Lagos State Government is yet to officially react to the report, but it said the state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, invited soldiers to the scene.\n\nAdegboruwa: Lagos Govt Sponsoring Smear Campaign Against Panel Members\n\nIn the meantime, a member of the #EndSARS panel, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, has accused the Lagos State government of sponsoring a smear campaign against members of the panel.\n\nAdegboruwa, in a statement, said since the submission of the #EndSARS panel report to the governor of Lagos State on November 15, members of the panel had become the subject of vicious attacks by those suspected to be agents of the government.\n\nAdegboruwa accused the Lagos State government of unleashing mindless propaganda upon panel members, while at the same time asking for restraint from the general public.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cSince the submission of the EndSARS panel report to the governor of Lagos State on November 15, 2021, members of the panel have become subject of vicious attacks by those suspected to be agents of the government.\n\n\u201cAll manner of allegations have been heaped upon panel members, some of who have been called unprintable names. I can confirm that no member of the panel lobbied to be appointed into the panel.\n\n\u201cAs a matter fact, in my own case, His Excellency, the Governor of Lagos State, appealed to me to accept my appointment, which I saw as a call to national service. The primary reason the governor gave to me then was that he wanted men and women of integrity, independent and not subject to manipulation, to be on the Panel.\n\n\u201cJust today, my attention has been drawn to an interview by a Senior Counsel to the Lagos State government, to the effect that panel members collected bribe in the course of the assignment. It is unfair, ungodly and least expected of the government and its lawyers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government asked for two weeks to enable it release a White Paper on the report submitted to it by the panel. And we have been waiting, but it would seem that the Lagos State Government has now unleashed mindless propaganda upon panel members whilst at the same time asking for restraint from the general public.\n\n\u201cI have in my custody, certified true copies of ALL proceedings of the panel and all exhibits tendered before the panel in respect of the Lekki Toll Gate Investigation. I urge the government to call its agents and lawyers to order so as not to provoke aggravated responses\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair to seek to denigrate peoples\u2019 hard-earned reputation on account only that they accepted to render selfless service at the behest of government. If the government and its agents are not restrained from attacking others, nothing stops us from defending our integrity.\n\n\u201cI should not become a victim of unwarranted attack just because I accepted to serve the government and the outcome of that assignment did not favour the expectations of the government.

See Also News How Oduduwa Varsity Owner, Adedoyin Tried To Use Propaganda Against SaharaReporters to Divert Attention From MBA Student's Murder\n\nHowever, he was said to have been reported missing since he checked in at the hotel on Friday, November 5 preceding his examinations scheduled for Saturday, November 6 and Sunday, November 7.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that it was noticed that Oludare was missing when his wife could not reach him on the phone.\n\nMeanwhile, he had earlier contacted his wife to inform her that he was staying in a hotel.\n\nFollowing a police investigation, money paid by Oludare for lodging was traced to Adesola, who worked in the hotel.\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the owner of the hotel, who also owns Oduduwa University, and other workers initially denied that Oludare was at the hotel.\n\nMeanwhile, the victim's body was discovered after some suspects, including workers at the hotel were arrested by the police.\n\nThe police announced that the student had been found dead without giving details of how, when and where he was found. See Also Scandal We\u2019ll Resist Attempts To Pervert Justice In Death Of Our Son --- Family Of Slain OAU Student Warns\n\nReacting, Adedoyin said he worked hard for his wealth, urging people not to tag him as a \u201cmoney ritualist or murderer.\u201d\n\nIn a voice note shared, the hotel owner appealed to the public to await police investigation on the matter.\n\nHe said, \u201cI, Rahmon Adedoyin is not a murderer or money ritualist. God already blessed and enriched me since I was 26 years old and up till now that I am 65 years old.\n\n\u201cI have never killed anyone. I am a devout Muslim. Adegoke lodged at Hilton Hotel, Room 305. The hotel officials that lodged him did not pay any money in his name into the hotel\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThere was also no record that he paid into the hotel\u2019s WEMA Bank account. I don\u2019t know how he was given a room without making payment into the official account of the company. I don\u2019t know why they decided to receive the payment into their personal account.\n\n\u201cI was only informed that something like that happened at the Hilton Hotel when police started searching for Timothy.\n\n\u201cWhen they (police) investigated and found where Timothy\u2019s corpse was dumped, senior police officers checked his body and confirmed that no part of his body was missing, so it is clear that no one asked them to get any of his body parts.\n\n\u201cI appeal to everyone to be patient and allow the police to do their work and thorough investigation.

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis, and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad, or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria, is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole, than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in app integrations. But, as none of these payment aps are widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalaskasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller micro transactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest growing economies in sub-saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life.

What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi).

There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "title": "African countries lose $5bn annually to dollar convertibility",
          "text": "African countries with 42 different currencies are losing $5 billion annually, as the cost of currency convertibility, Wamkele Mene, Secretary-General of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, said on Friday in Durban, South Africa.\n\nThis, he said, was one of the reasons why intra-African trade is constrained and the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are the most affected.\n\nApart from that, he said inefficiency, the lack of expeditious conclusion of transactions, are the very challenges Africans, particularly, SMEs, encounter as a result of 42 currencies in the continent.\n\n\u201cToday if you want to trade between South Africa and Kenya, you have to first convert the South African Rand into dollars, before transacting with somebody with a business in Kenya. You then receive the United States dollar, convert it into Kenyan Shillings and then you can conclude the transaction,\u2019\u2019 he said while addressing journalists on the sideline of the 2021 Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) in Durban.\n\nAs part of efforts towards addressing this challenge, Mene said AfCFTA is working with Afreximbank to establish a Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which will enable Africans to transact in real-time on a digital platform with somebody or entity in other parts of the continent using their local currency, \u201cso you will not have to worry about converting to a dollar, or Euro or any other currency\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Revisiting the African Continental Free Trade Area: Impact, challenges and opportunities\n\nHe explained that Afreximbank is providing liquidity worth over a billion dollars for the settlement as well as establishing the technology, while AfCFTA is providing the legal framework.\n\n\u201cThis is the very first time we have had a single set of rules for trade and investment. So we need to leverage on this single instrument to make sure that we maximize the benefit,\u201d Mene said.\n\n\u201cAs we are now in a free trade area, it is our desire and objective that one day, as we move along the integration in Africa, the next step will be custom union and so on. One day we will be a single currency in the monetary union that was the Abuja treaty, and that is one of the objectives \u2013 highest level of integration,\u201d he said further.\n\nOn the issue of currency adjustment for countries that are losing revenue as a result of reducing tariffs on goods produced on the continent or eliminating such, he said AfCFTA and Afreximbank are in the final stages of negotiating an AfCFTA adjustment fund worth $10 billion.\n\n\u201cThey will work with us to mobilize up to $10 billion of a trade finance facility for those countries that would suffer short-term revenue losses as a result of reducing tariffs or eliminating them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that there will be countries that as a result of elimination of tariffs, they will suffer short term revenue losses. For many countries on the continent, tariffs or duties are a source of revenue. Ultimately what we should aim for is that tariffs or duties should not be a tool for revenue generation but should be an industrial development tool.

          "title": "Real estate emerges world\u2019s most popular store of wealth",
          "text": "Countries store over 60% of wealth in real estate\n\nTwo-thirds of global net worth is stored in real estate and only about 20 percent in other fixed assets, according to consulting firm, McKinsey.\n\nA recent report by the New York-based company states that the high share of countries\u2019 wealth that is stored in the property market raises questions about whether societies store their wealth productively.\n\nBreakdown of the report reveals that the value of residential real estate amounted to almost half of global net worth in 2020, while corporate and government buildings and land accounted for an additional 20 percent.\n\nGlobal net wealth jumped to $514 trillion in 2020, rising by $358 trillion from 2000 levels, according to a McKinsey report cited by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe are now wealthier than we have ever been,\u201d Jan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute in Zurich, told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nAssets that drive much of economic growth include infrastructure, industrial structures, machinery and equipment; intangibles \u2013 as well as inventories and mineral reserves make up the rest.\n\nOn why most countries store a large part of their wealth in real estate, McKinsey cites the product of high quantity and quality of housing, high construction costs relative to other prices in the economy, or high land prices. The trend has been consistent since 2000.\n\n\u201cGrowth in household real estate wealth stemmed from rising home prices, with the cost of land and construction also increasing,\u201d it states.\n\nAlso, analysis of the report reveals that the rising land prices, which accounted for more than half of the increased value of the global household real estate and about 75 percent of the growth in Australia and the United Kingdom, was the most significant driver of household real estate stock growth from 2000 to 2020.\n\nAccording to the report, nearly all net worth growth from 2000 to 2020 occurred in the household sector as a result of growing equity and real estate valuations.\n\nExplaining further, McKinsey says the real assets held by households consisted almost exclusively of real estate and was fuelled by the growth in household net worth. Household net worth grew from 4.2 times GDP in 2000 to 5.7 times GDP in 2020.\n\nThe residential sub-sector of the real estate market, which attracted the most of the global net worth in the review period, also mirrors the trend that has been witnessed in the property market in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nOpportunities exist for investors in residential real estate. Tokunbo Ajayi, CEO, Propertygate Development and Investment Company, confirms this, saying much of the opportunities here are in small-size residential family units.\n\n\u201cThe reason developers and investors opt for these small-size units such as one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments is because large-size luxury housing units cannot find buyers,\u201d he explains.\n\nCompared with other asset classes or market segments, the residential real estate market in many parts of Nigeria, including Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan and Enugu, remains strong and resilient to the impact of COVID-19, the 2021 half-year report on Nigerian Real Estate Market by Northcourt shows.\n\n\u201cThe demand for gated estates within leading cities that intensified towards the end of Q4, 2020, continued for much of half year 2021,\u201d Ayo Ibaru, Northcourt\u2019s COO/director of Real Estate Research, states.\n\nAccording to Ibaru, the findings by Northcourt suggest a general decline in vacancy rates across Lagos and a spike in demand for assets in gated communities for security purposes.\n\nThe full re-opening of the Nigerian economy following the ease in lockdown restrictions and increase in investors\u2019 appetite for the real estate market amid the low-interest rate environment helped the property sector to post its highest growth in six years in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nRead also: Relive Housing targets early career professionals, first-time homeowners with Cornerstone Height\n\nNigeria\u2019s real estate sector expanded by 3.85 percent in the second quarter of 2021, the highest second-quarter growth the sector has recorded since the 4.95 percent growth in Q2, 2014, as analysed from data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nCompared with the corresponding quarter of 2020, when Nigeria\u2019s property sector contracted by 21.99 percent, the 3.85 percent GDP growth reported in the second quarter of this year is higher by 25.84 percentage points, and 2.08 percentage points higher relative to Q1, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis shows investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigeria real estate sector as a subsector of the economy which thrives despite the current inflation and devaluation of the naira,\u201d Freeman Osonuga, Real Estate Investor, Advisor and Best-Selling Author, says.\n\nReal asset with highest investment globally\n\nWith 67 percent share of the global real asset investment, real estate ranks the top on the list, according to McKinsey.\n\nThe closest to real estate was fixed asset with a share of 17 percent, 50 percentage points gap between the values reported for the property market. Inventories recorded 8 percent while intangibles and non-produced products recorded 4 percent each.\n\nAccording to the recent report by the advisory firm, three major components drove the expansion in global net worth: the real estate boom and valuation gain common to all countries, except Japan; rising values of and investment in corporate assets, especially in China and Mexico; and growth in net financial assets among net exporters, those with consistent current account surpluses (in other words, accumulating net asset positions).\n\n\u201cReal estate fuelled at least 50 percent of net worth expansion relative to GDP in all countries other than China and Japan,\u2019 it said.\n\nThe most significant growth in real estate stock was in Australia, Canada, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (China saw the greatest home price growth but also had significant GDP growth, and as a result had more muted growth of real estate in relation to GDP), analysed from McKinsey\u2019s report.\n\nType of real estate with most investment globally\n\nThe residential sub-sector of the global real estate market has the most investment by value, as analysed from the McKinsey\u2019s report.\n\nThe value of residential real estate amounted to about half of global net worth in 2020, while corporate and government buildings and land accounted for an additional 20 percent.\n\nAccording to the data, land/residential real estate accounted for 51 percent of the global real estate investment in 2020, higher than the 49 percent that was reported for the non-residential arm of the property market.",

          "text": "Mo Abudu, the CEO of EbonyLife Group, is known for several firsts in the media space, and is adding another feather to her hat. For the first time in history, a case study about a female African media entrepreneur titled: \u2018The Harvard Business School \u2013 EbonyLife Case Study,\u2019 will be taught at Harvard Business School (HBS) to over 1,000 MBA students.\n\n\u201cEbonyLife turns 10 next year, so the case reflects on how we started and where we are today. It will also highlight our challenges along the way,\u201d Abudu said. She revealed in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay that she is currently on the HBS campus in Boston where this case study will be taught, and also to share her story with the students and faculty.\n\nWhat this means is that, first-year students at HBS will study a case about an African company, led by a Nigerian woman. It will become one of approximately 500 case studies read by students over the course of the two-year MBA programme. Nearly half of these cases are based on global organisations.\n\nRead Also: Netflix\u2019s Nigerian original film, \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019 from Mo Abudu\u2019s EbonyLife wraps production\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to listening to them and answering their questions. I am humbled and honoured to be chosen for this, and I will always do all I can to encourage everyone out there on the possibilities and results that abound in daring to excel, because as I always say, if you can think it, you can do it,\u201d Abudu said.\n\nWhen Mo Abudu launched EbonyLife TV in 2013, her primary goal for the channel was to create a more positive narrative around Africa. What followed was a string of aspirational TV series to include Fifty, Castle & Castle, Sons of the Caliphate and The Governor, among others.\n\nHer desire to change the narrative about Africa in the international scene birthed her love for filmmaking with the creation of EbonyLife Films in 2014. She has produced different blockbusters such as: Fifty, The Wedding Party, Chief Daddy, The Royal Hibiscus Hotel and Your Excellency. Furthermore, she was the executive producer of \u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9, a feature film that exposes the shady business of human trafficking in Nigeria. The film premiered as a Netflix Original in October 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Sony Pictures Television (SPT) announced a three-year deal with EbonyLife TV that would include co-production of The Dahomey Warriors. In 2019, AMC Networks (USA) announced its partnership with EbonyLife to produce Nigeria 2099, an afro-futuristic crime-drama created by EbonyLife. Also, in June 2020, Netflix signed a multi-title deal with EbonyLife to create two original series and multiple branded films and a series. In February 2021, EbonyLife Media signed a First Look deal with Sony Pictures and a slate of co-produced film and television projects with Will and Jada Smith\u2019s Westbrook Studios.\n\nMost recently, EbonyLife Studios and Will Packer Productions are teaming to develop an untitled project, based on Evan Ratliff\u2019s Bloomberg article, \u2018The Fall of the Billionaire Gucci Master.\u2019\n\nThe HBS case study is to be presented in two parts \u2013 A and B. Case study A chronicles the journey of EbonyLife Media from inception to December 2020, while case study B provides a summary of what has occurred between January and October 2021.\n\nHaving read case study A, the students will have to consider the choices told in the HBS case study abstract and give their analysis. In relating with Abudu and understanding case study B, they will discover what has changed since the case was written and what the value of their assessment and recommendations have been.\n\nWhat this feat also means is that, Mo Abudu will be joining a long list of CEOs, including Warren Buffet and Elon Musk, whose strategies and decisions have been analysed in HBS case studies.\n\n\u201cAt first, I was surprised by Harvard\u2019s interest in us; however, I can now see how a diverse faculty and student body could benefit from looking at how companies in Africa and other parts of the world deal with challenges unique to their environment. I\u2019m looking forward to the discussions and the students\u2019 perspectives,\u201d said Abudu.\n\nShe oversees the EbonyLife Group, which includes all EbonyLife Media assets and EbonyLife Place, Nigeria\u2019s first luxury entertainment resort. She is also a part of OSCARS in the producer membership category, and she is the only African woman selected in this category. Forbes described her as \u201cAfrica\u2019s Most Successful Woman,\u201d while CNN said she was \u201cAfrica\u2019s Queen of Media who conquered the continent.\u201d\n\nAbudu is highly sought after for her knowledge of the African and global creative industry. She has spoken at the Wharton School of Business, Cambridge University Judge School of Business, NYU, Oxford University and Harvard University. Throughout the years, Abudu has been a recipient of numerous awards and international recognitions.",

The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201d In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary.\n\n\u201d God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory.\n\n\u201dA lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nWhile etressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system.\n\n\u201dLet him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe president condoled with Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the Southeast as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that \u201dbusinesses have collapsed, education is crumbling, and there is fear everywhere\u201d.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that he could control Kanu, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa.\n\n\u201dMr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nOthers in the visiting delegation were; Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former Governor of Anambra, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, and Mr Tagbo Amaechi.\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has said the request an unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which he described as \u201cheavy,\u201d will be difficult to consider, but he would nonetheless, consider it.\n\nKanu, who is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) after his rendition from Kenya, is standing trial for treason before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe President who made the promise Friday while receiving a group under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, at State House, Abuja, said the unconditional release of Kanu runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nThe President, according to a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, told the 93-year-old statesman that: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nThe President, while emphasising his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nBuhari commiserated with Chief Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian, who earlier described the situation in the South East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d said businesses had collapsed, education was crumbling, and there was fear everywhere.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe United States Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has said his country has so far delivered 7.6 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to Nigeria, and will send another significant number of doses by the end of the year, with no strings attached.\n\nBlinken who disclosed this during a joint press conference with Nigeria\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama in Abuja on Thursday, after the signing ceremony for $2.1 Billion development assistance agreement between the two countries, also noted that the United States is helping to bring treatment to more than 1.5 million people in Nigeria living with HIV/AIDS, and is on track to control the epidemic by 2023.\n\nThe secretary of state who is on official visit to Nigeria, noted that Nigeria touches the United States every day through the amazing power of its diaspora.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMusicians, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, athletes enrich our lives, make them more interesting, more rewarding, and we\u2019re grateful for that as well.\u201d\n\nBlinken said, \u201cOur meetings today, the engagements that I\u2019ll have throughout my time here in Nigeria, reflect the depth of this partnership of now more than six decades and the way that our collaboration is vital \u2013 and maybe more vital than ever \u2013 to tackling shared challenges and actually delivering results for our people, which is what our responsibility really is.\n\n\u201cLet me just touch on a few of the issues that we\u2019ve been talking about today and where our cooperation is especially important. First, we\u2019re working together to beat back COVID-19 and to build back better as we address the devastating impact that it\u2019s had on all of us \u2013 on our communities, on our economies. The United States has delivered 7.6 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to Nigeria, and we expect to send another significant number of doses by the end of the year, donated with no strings attached. And we\u2019re providing significant aid to save lives right now, from the more than 150 testing labs that we helped to set up nationwide to helping tackle a food security crisis that was worsened by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe have teamed up for a long time to confront epidemics and to improve public health. In that sense, this is not new. The United States and others worked with Nigeria toward eliminating wild polio virus, supporting vaccination campaigns, aiding surveillance to detect and isolate cases. That collaboration was key to the country being certified free of the virus in August of 2020. That\u2019s a huge achievement. American assistance is helping to bring treatment to more than 1.5 million people in Nigeria living with HIV/AIDS, and we\u2019re on track for epidemic control by 2023. Our support for primary health care helps provide vital services to more than 60 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThese and other efforts have helped create a robust infrastructure for Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response and broader efforts to strengthen public health security, which are essential to detect and prevent the next pandemic.\n\n\u201cSecond, we\u2019re working with Nigeria to build back better from the pandemic by fostering inclusive, sustainable economic growth. That\u2019s the goal of the 2 billion development agreement that Geoffrey and I just signed, and which will make, I think, significant investments in improving access to quality education, public health, and other services and tools that Nigeria\u2019s rising generations are looking for and need to thrive here at home and in a global economy. And we\u2019re committed to working with the government as it pursues economic reforms, for example, to create a more stable regulatory environment to attract more foreign investment.\n\n\u201cThird, we\u2019re working together to address the global climate crisis. The foreign minister and I were both just at COP26, where President Buhari made significant new commitments to join the Global Methane Pledge and build on the progress that Nigeria has made in solar power. This is crucial as more and more Nigerians feel the impact of the crisis, something the president, I must say, talked about very eloquently when we were together a short while ago, and people displaced, people who have lost connections with their livelihoods as a result of climate change, among other disruptions.\n\n\u201cOur work together also demonstrates how tackling this crisis represents an opportunity \u2013 a once-in-a-generations opportunity \u2013 to create good-paying jobs and expand renewable energy access. The USAID has a five-year, $110 million project, the Nigeria Power Sector Program, and that\u2019s supporting key initiatives like the Solar Power Naija, which will bring solar energy to 25 million Nigerians who are off the electric grid and lack access to power. That, in turn, is expected to create as many as 250,000 new jobs in the energy sector, spur local industry, generate $18.5 million in annual tax revenues. So it will have practical, meaningful effects.\u201d\n\nBlinken said the United States will continue to support Nigeria in its effort to tackle terrorism, while expressing satisfaction with the report of the Lagos State panel of inquiry on Lekki tollgate shooting, which indicated the Army and the police in the killing of protesters.\n\n\u201cFourth, we\u2019re working with Nigeria to address security challenges, including those posed by Boko Haram, ISIS West Africa, and other terrorist and extremist groups. In meetings with the president, with the vice president, with the foreign minister, we discussed the importance of a comprehensive approach that builds effective security forces, addresses the underlying drivers of extremism, and respects Nigerians\u2019 basic human rights. The United States is committed to helping Nigeria do that by continuing to invest in our security partnership and the institutions that strengthen the rule of law and that hold accountable those who commit human rights abuses, corruption, and other acts that harm the Nigerian people. By tackling these issues, we can help to address some of the problems that have been key drivers of insecurity,\u201dhe said.\n\n\u201cTo that end, let me say that we welcome the conclusion of the investigation by the independent of inquiry established by the Lagos state government to look into the events that took place near Lekki toll gate in Lagos in October of 2020, and this, of course, was amidst the \u201cEnd SARS\u201d protests, including the killings and other alleged abuses by the security forces. We anticipate and look to the state and the federal government\u2019s response to the findings and expect those to include steps that ensure accountability and address the grievances of the victims and their families. We\u2019re also working closely with Nigeria to help the populations most affected by conflict and violence in the country, particularly in the northeast, where the United States is providing vital humanitarian aid to approximately 2.2 million internally displaced Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe United States continues to build the capacity, together with Nigeria, of the military, including through the recent delivery of 12 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. But capacity building goes much deeper than delivering military hardware, something that we talked about as well. We\u2019re also providing more human rights and rule of law training because military and civilian security forces are more effective when they act in accordance with these values and because it\u2019s crucial that Nigeria hold accountable members of the military who commit abuses.\n\n\u201cJournalists, human rights defenders, and others in Nigeria\u2019s very vibrant civil society are playing a vital role in shining a spotlight on these and other issues. Their ability to exercise freedom of expression and other basic human rights is crucial to advocating for individuals and communities and strengthening this country\u2019s vibrant democracy, as we\u2019ve seen in the successful efforts to promote electoral reform and lower the age at which Nigerians can run for office. I look very much forward to meeting several of these leaders tomorrow, including faith leaders who are defusing communal tensions and promoting peace. And we look forward to Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest democracy, joining the Summit for Democracy next month. All participants from government to civil society will make commitments to improve and strengthen democracy in our respective countries and strengthen the partnership among democratic nations.\n\n\u201cThe range of issues that we\u2019re working on together is vast, but given the interests we share and the challenges we have in common, delivering for our people demands that we find ways to deepen our existing ties and partnerships even further. That\u2019s ultimately what this visit and the work that we\u2019re doing every single day between our governments, between our people \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\u201cLastly, let just say one brief word about yesterday\u2019s events in Sudan. The United States is deeply concerned by the violence used by Sudanese military against people engaged in peaceful protest, which reportedly killed more than a dozen civilians and wounded scores more. The military must respect the rights of civilians to assemble peacefully and express their views, and we continue to support the demand of the Sudanese people for the restoration of the civilian-led transition, including the return of Prime Minister Hamdok to office and the immediate release of all those detained since October 25th.\u201d\n\nIn his own remarks, Onyeama thanked the United States for its technical support, especially in the provision of vaccines, while noting that Nigeria is working towards producing own vaccines.\n\nOn the report of the Lagos State panel on police brutality, the minister said the government believes in the rule of law and are following all the processes.\n\nHe noted that the government has been totally transparent and actually encouraged and helped to set up these panels of inquiry and to make it transparent and totally open, and will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cSo as was mentioned, the Secretary had excellent meetings with Mr. President and also with the vice president. We were able to sign \u2013 again, as he mentioned \u2013 an agreement that, within the framework of USAID, will engage and provide assistance in very important, critical areas for the country, and we thank you very much indeed for this technical assistance and support.\n\n\u201cThere are various areas that we cooperate with the United States in. First off \u2013 as, again, the Secretary has mentioned \u2013 to thank the United States for the assistance that was provided, especially the vaccines, in the health sector to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We appreciate this enormously. Of course, the real challenge \u2013 we\u2019re a country of 200 million people, and we have to \u2013 we aspire to about 70 percent vaccination level for our people. That\u2019s a huge number,\u201d Onyeama noted.\n\n\u201cAnd what we really need to be looking at, of course, is manufacturing vaccines ourselves here, and we\u2019re hoping to have some cooperation and support from the United States and other friendly countries in the transfer of technology that is required and also in the licensing agreements, especially for the transfer of intellectual property rights, the permission or the license to produce. That might take some time, but we are hoping that we can count on the United States to help bring that about as some of the pharmaceutical companies, American ones, are producing very important vaccines.\n\n\u201cAn area that\u2019s also of importance to us here in Nigeria is also the consular one. I mean, a lot of Nigerians are asking how we can ease the regime of visa applications to the United States embassies. And so, of course, we had a mechanism, the drop box mechanism, and now a lot of us \u2013 and because COVID has, of course, exacerbated everything \u2013 have very long waiting times to even secure interviews for their visa applications. And so this is an area that we hope that we can really look at and try to find some solution to.\n\n\u201cThe security aspect that you\u2019ve also mentioned that was discussed with Mr. President and also with the vice president. It\u2019s an area, again, that we have very important and very fruitful cooperation with the United States. Of course, the global terrorism is a global scourge, and we all need to work together to address it. And we appreciate enormously the weaponry that\u2019s been provided to Nigeria. And as you say correctly, it\u2019s not just the hardware but also the, quote/unquote, \u201csoftware,\u201d of training the personnel to be able to have \u2013 to take maximum advantage of this weaponry. But we do appreciate the cooperation in security, in the security area, the sharing of intelligence, and we\u2019re very much on the same page with regards to the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cIn the area of trade, of course, once upon a time, the United States was our largest market for petroleum, for selling oil. And in a few years, we\u2019ve seen the U.S. become totally self-sufficient, so our largest market has disappeared right there. But we would, of course, like to also access the U.S. markets for other products that we have. This government has, as a priority, the diversification of our economy. Of course, we relied far too heavily on one commodity, petroleum.\n\n\u201cAnd the United States has a mechanism, the African Growth Opportunities Act, to facilitate market access for African countries. And we\u2019re not taking advantage of it as much as we should. And one of the areas of challenge for us is a priority area for us, which is agriculture, and we\u2019re hoping to export more agricultural products to the United States. And there are certain market access issues we have, some with regards to the quality of the agricultural products, phytosanitary aspects, and we would like to be able to work with you to be able to try and address that and facilitate more easily for our agricultural sector access to the U.S. market.\n\n\u201cAnd the U.S. is coming up to look at other areas of cooperation with developing countries. And our president, President Muhammadu Buhari, met of course in Glasgow during the COP26 with President Biden. And President Biden is one of the presidents or leaders behind an initiative to access \u2013 to make \u2013 to facilitate the support for developing countries in regards to infrastructure. And again, this is a key priority area for our government, the huge infrastructure deficit that we have and challenges that we face. And so we really look forward to working together in trying to help solve some of these infrastructure challenges that we and other developing countries face. And they\u2019re really happy that it\u2019s now become a real policy objective of the United States to do this, and we look forward to working with you very much in this area.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the humanitarian field, we\u2019re extremely grateful to the support that has been provided by the United States in the humanitarian area. The large number of internally displaced persons that we have in north and the work that some of your agencies are doing in this area is something that we welcome enormously.\n\n\u201cAnd of course we discussed with the vice president on the issue \u2013 the area of climate change. And so here, after the Paris Agreement, developing countries, United States and others, big emitters I might say, made a commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries to help with adaptation, mitigation. And so far, it\u2019s been observed more in breach than in the observance of this promise. So we\u2019re hoping also that the U.S. \u2013 and we\u2019re delighted to have the U.S. back supporting the multilateral system and back in the climate change, finding a solution to \u2013 on climate action. And so we\u2019re also hoping that the U.S. will push the other industrialized countries to make good on this promise, because we certainly need this kind of financial support to be able to put in place all the actions that we need for mitigation and for adaptation.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, in this context, as the vice president mentioned, is a very important issue for us as a gas-producing country. In fact, Nigeria is seen more \u2013 well, we are actually more of a gas-producing country than actually an oil-producing country. And we\u2019re looking to gas to help to address our energy needs. And we noticed that a number of the big industrialized countries and financial institutions are now defunding projects and gas projects, and of course this would really be a huge blow for countries such as ours that really want to see gas as a transition fuel and to have time in which to work towards net zero \u2013 2050, 2060, net zero emission, but in the meantime to be able to also continue to use gas and exploit the gas that we have at our disposal. So we hope that the U.S. will understand and support us in getting financial institutions such as the World Bank and others to go easy, as it were, on some of these countries that need this transition period to use these fuels.\n\n\u201cAnd you talked about the \u201cEnd SARS,\u201d and of course the Lagos panel has come out with a report. But I think one thing is absolutely clear, is that the government believes in the rule of law and are following all the processes. The government\u2019s been totally transparent and actually encouraged and helped to set up these panels of inquiry and to make it transparent and totally open. And we\u2019ll continue to do so. So I think that there\u2019s no issue there.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re also learned with and have read with much appreciation that Nigeria has been taken off the list of concern for countries that the U.S. feels have issues with religious freedom. So we appreciate that you have recognized that Nigeria need not be a country of concern as far as religious freedom is concerned. So we welcome that decision by your government.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the state the state will need about $15 billion over the next five years for infrastructure.\n\nSanwo-Olu who spoke at the third Lagos investors\u2019 roundtable and launch of a deal book organised by the Office of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Investment, noted the was in view of the rising population and limited geographical space of the state.\n\nThe governor called on investors to optimise the advantages of the opportunities in Lagos State toward the goal of developing a 21st Century economy as projected by his administration.\n\nThe governor Sanwo-Olu also declared that the combined effects of climate and the security and economic challenges in northern Nigeria were putting pressure on the population of the state.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the continued growth and success of Lagos is premised on the strength and diversity of our partnerships. It is such strategic partnerships that account for Lagos being by far the leading recipient of local and foreign direct investments in Nigeria. It is estimated that, in the last few years, about 80 percent of the investments into Nigeria, has come into Lagos,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese investments remain vital to our economic growth and wellbeing, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods across the city. This is the reason why a forum like this is so important \u2013 as a platform for harmonising our respective visions and targets and agreeing on key actions that will not only strengthen existing investment partnerships but also initiate new ones.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that Lagos is a city of 22 million people confined to a small landmass.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs a government, we understand the value of these relationships in fostering economic resilience, particularly during times of uncertainty, like this one we are in, marked by the combined effects of a global pandemic, climate change, global inflation, the burden of poverty and social and economic inequality, among others.\n\n\u201cAs a low-lying aquatic city with over 22 million citizens, confined to the smallest landmass in Nigeria, Lagos is especially vulnerable to all the challenges of a sprawling, densely populated, climate challenged, fast-growing Megacity.\n\n\u201cWe believe that given the rising population and limited geography space that we have, Lagos will indeed require about $15 billion over the next five years on infrastructure alone. $15 billion is about five times the budget that we currently have. Lagos budget is about $3 billion today.\u201d\n\nWhile assuring investors that Lagos was open and ready for investments, innovation and collaboration, Sanwo-Olu assured investors and private partners that the state government would create enabling policies and environment for them to thrive in Lagos and for their investments to be safe and secure, as well as ensuring that innovation thrives.\n\n\u201cIndeed we have a huge responsibility to develop critical hard and soft infrastructure that can act as a catalyst for what you do as investors. All of these we have been doing and will continue to do,\u201d the governor said.\n\nSanwo-Olu during the event also launched the \u2018Lagos Deal Book,\u2019 a compendium of investment opportunities across the state as well as information about the incentives for making the investments and the processes for doing so.\n\nHe said: \u201cI encourage you all to take advantage of the rich information contained in this Deal Book, to guide and inform your decision making. Information, they say, is power, and there is something of value and interest to each and every one of you, inside the compendium.\n\n\u201cI also urge you all to continue to support, partner and collaborate with Lagos State and with one another, to create sustainable economic prosperity that will touch the lives of all Lagosians. I would like to ask you all, to please spread the word; Lagos State is open and ready for investment, innovation, and collaboration.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.03 percent in the third quarter (Q3) of 2021, compared with the 5. 01 percent recorded in the preceding quarter of same year, according to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday.\n\nThe Statistician General of the Federation (SGF)/Chief Executive, NBS, Dr. Simon Harry, who revealed this at a media briefing, said the negative impact of the COVID-19 continued to impact on economic performance.\n\nHarry noted that despite the slower growth, the Q3 performance was considered a tremendous improvement over both Q1 and Q2 of the year, adding that there had been steady growth of the economy.\n\nIn nominal terms, aggregate GDP increased to N45.11 trillion in the period under review, compared with the N39.12 trillion recorded in Q2 and N39.09 trillion in Q3 2020.\n\nIn the same vein, real GDP which shows volume of economic activities, stood at N18.54 trillion, higher by N1.85 trillion compared to N16.69 trillion in Q2 as well as higher by N718.57 billion when compared to N17.82 trillion recorded in the corresponding quarter of last year.\n\nThe economy was largely driven by the non-oil sector which accounted for 92.51per cent of GDP, while the oil sector contributed 7.49 per cent to growth in Q3.\n\nDaily oil production averaged 1.57 million barrels per day (mbpd) compared to 1.61mbpd in Q2 and 1.67mbpd in Q3 2020.\n\nOil growth rate stood at -10.73 per cent in real terms in the review period.\n\nThe SGF explained that the negative GDP figures recorded in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had serious base effects on output figures for Q2 and Q3.\n\nHarry said: \u201cI must state that the improvement being seen in the output growth over the last four quarters depicts a steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy.\n\n\u201cGlobally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic.\u201d\n\nHe said economic recovery remained a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors, ThisDay reported.\n\nHe explained: \u201cHowever, in Nigeria the prospect of full recovery is glaring provided the current trend of improved economic performance is sustained in the rest of the year and beyond.\u201d\n\nAgriculture contributed 29.94 per cent to real GDP, higher than the 23.78 per cent recorded in Q2 while manufacturing accounted 8.96 per cent higher than the 8.69 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter.\n\nAlso, trade contributed 14.93 per cent to GDP, lower than the 16.66 per cent recorded in Q2.\n\n\u201cYou might be looking at the 5.01 per cent as being higher than the 4.03 per cent but when you look at the base effects, you discover that the margin between the two, certainly that of the third quarter was a higher figure compared to the 5.01 per cent as released in the second quarter of the year,\u201d the SGF added.\n\nHe insisted the economy was growing rather than declining.\n\n\u201cThere was serious base effects affecting the figure because Q3 2020 recorded negative rate while Q2 2020 recorded negative rate. And so if you consider the margin between the two figures, you will discover that the economy certainly is growing rather than decreasing. It is the base figures that have influenced the figure for this year,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, reacting to the GDP numbers, analysts have urged the federal government to deepen its poverty alleviation programmes so that vulnerable Nigerians would feel its impact.\n\nThey also advised the government to initiate policies that could enhance real growth and, \u201cnot paper growth\u201d as well as curb the rising insecurity across the country.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Friday, urged the Nigerian political class to continue to engage to make the country a better place.\n\nLawan spoke in Abuja at the 2021 Democracy Dialogue organised by the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation with the theme: \u201cDemocracy and Unity of the State.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President was full of praises for former President Goodluck Jonathan for his activities while outside office especially for promoting unity in Nigeria and the growth of democracy both within and outside the country.\n\n\u201cAt the risk of sounding repetitive, I want to add here, very categorically, that, Sir, you are a man of peace. Sir, You believe in Nigeria. You believe in the unity of this country and what can be more testifying is your engagement outside office.\n\n\u201cAfter you left office in 2015, you have decided to work for the unity of this country, to work with the leadership of this country, to ensure that Nigeria remains united. That we remain focus as a people and of course, what can be more apt than what we have here today.\n\n\u201cThe theme of today\u2019s dialogue, Democracy and the Unity of the State. It may be pan African but charity begins at home sir.\n\n\u201cThere are many of us here who are not of the PDP group or party. And to me, it\u2019s a clear testimony of one fact, that you are a uniter. That we believe that you mean well for this country and it is so. And for those of us who believe that, we will always identify with you and your cause.\n\n\u201cThe political class, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is a clan. It doesn\u2019t matter which political party you belong to. It\u2019s a clan and that clan must ensure that we continue to unite. That we continue to engage to make this country better.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is in the office because we have to have a country in the first place before election can be conducted. What you are doing, Your Excellency, is to show example of what our leaders can do outside office after their service. Only God knows what will happen tomorrow but you have given a very good account of yourself.\n\n\u201cWhen you were President, I was in the opposition. Sir, I supported many of your policies and of course, I opposed those that I felt I should oppose. My belief is, and many of us out there, you have domonstrated very clearly that this country can be great. How? It can be great if the political class decides to be selfless, decides to be honest.\n\n\u201cAnd I will like to make reference to a statement by our keynote speaker, Professor Abdoulaye Bathily when he concluded his address by saying we need a peaceful and strong Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. How do we achieve that? We can achieve that if we continue to have this kind of leadership. Whether in office or out of office, we have that responsibility, that obligation to give Nigerians the sense of decent citizenship wherever they are, whatever they are and wherever they chose to be in this country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen you have a marriage bedevilled by suspicion, that marriage is likely to suffer a bit. What we need to do is to behave like you Sir. As leaders, be open to all manners of people especially those that we lead.\n\n\u201cThat we don\u2019t allow suspicion between us. When political leaders allow for suspicion between and among themselves, the outcome is the grassroots or the ethnic nationalities will behave the same way.\n\n\u201cToday, I theresay sir, our major problem, among many, will be the suspicion between the different ethnic groups otherwise why will someone care or bother where the President comes from. Let the President come from anywhere.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is leadership that will give sense to the people, provide everything within the constraint of resources that the people need.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t care but when we suspect each other, that\u2019s when people crawl back to their ethnic enclaves and you are doing quite the reverse of that. You are helping Nigeria democracy to grow by the day,\u201d Lawan said.",

It only did not work out well, it was peacefully conducted, the best ever conducted since PDP started.\n\n\u201cI believe that when people have done well, you commend them. When you give them another opportunity, they will put in their best. And that is one of things I have come today to say my brother, you\u2019ve done well with your people. You did not put us to shame.\u201d\n\nWike noted that when he and others nominated Fintiri as the chairman of the convention planning committee, they never had any reservation about his capacity to deliver a credible and transparent convention.\n\nThe Governor also used the occasion to shower encomium on Fintiri for his developmental strides in Adamawa State, particularly in Yola, the State capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow much does he get from the federation account yet he is able to judiciously put them into use for the interest and development of Adamawa State. If other people had done this within the city, he would have moved on to other areas that need attention. I want to plea to all of you to continue to give him the support.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Fintiri said the successful conduct of PDP convention had provided Nigerians, especially the younger generation, an alternative platform to elect the next Nigerian president in 2023.\n\nHe urged Wike, who he acknowledged contributed immeasurably to the success of the convention, not to relent in his support for the party in the years ahead.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not just colleagues, we are not just in the same party, we have discovered ourselves to be good friends and even metamorphosing into being brothers. This is what we need in this country.\n\n\u201cThat is why I am not a supporter of those who are calling for zoning of the presidency. I am for those that are calling for good candidate that can bring this country together, and improve on the potentials that abound in both human and capital of Nigeria.\n\n\u201d But, I trust that whoever we are going to get as our presidential candidate in 2023, will be the person that Nigerians want, will be the person that understands this country and will be the person that will pull this country together and put her where she belongs in the comity of nations.\u201d",

I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari offered to examine a lighter resolution in response to the elder statesman\u2019s appeal, but expressed concern that doing so might jeopardize the separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with a very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and was brought back to the country, he did not interfere but allowed the system to take its course.\n\n\u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from the outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nOther members of the delegation to the President include Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former Governor of Anambra State, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Chief Barrister Goddy Uwazurike, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, and Mr Tagbo Mbazulike Amaechi.",

          "text": "\u2026Party\u2019ll bounce back, Ayu vows \u2018\u2026 Be proactive, constructive to earn Nigerians forgiveness\u2019 \u2026 Reconciliation sacrosanct says analysts \u2018\u2026 You should provide better alternative\u2019\n\nAs the newly elected national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) awaits official inauguration on December 9, 2021, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU examines the hurdles before the leadership of Nigeria\u2019s major opposition party and asks: Can the executive provide needed opposition?\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was founded in 1998, in the run up to the 1999 general elections and the return of democracy after several years of military rule, by members of numerous groups and organisations, including the G-18 and G-34.\n\nThe party, which had a broad membership drawn from all spheres of life, quickly became the country\u2019s dominant party winning majority of seats in the executive and legislature.\n\nThe party in 2003 maintained majority win in the executive and legislature with President Olusegun Obasanjo being re-elected for a second term in office.\n\nFollowing the party\u2019s unofficial policy of rotating the presidency between the North and the South the former Governor of Katsina state, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, emerged the party\u2019s flag bearer and was elected president in 2007.\n\nHowever, the power shift equation was disrupted following President Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death and the swearing in of Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as president.\n\nJonathan\u2019s decision to run in the 2011 presidential election generated much controversy leading to division in the party across region and religion, a situation that appeared to have festered despite the party\u2019s victory at the 2011 general elections.\n\nAs the 2015 general elections approached the PDP had become weakened on all fronts following in fighting and mass exodus by party chieftains including governors.\n\nThe party\u2019s defeat in 2015 and the emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari brought to an end PDP\u2019s 16 years in office at the centre, just as the party also lost its majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives to the APC as well as some states it controlled.\n\nThings fall apart\n\nExpectation was that the party would have regrouped after the 2015 elections as the major opposition party; however, the PDP have continued to record gales of defections, with the leadership of the party being blamed for the party\u2019s misfortune.\n\nThe defection of three PDP governors: Dave Umahi of Ebonyi state, Ben Ayade of Cross River state, and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara state, to the ruling APC, is viewed in some quarters as the last stroke that broke the carmel\u2019s back leading to the removal of Prince Uche Secondus as national chairman of the PDP.\n\nThe suspension of the PDP National Chairman Prince Uche Secondus by a Rivers State High Court led to a series of legal tussles. After weeks of uncertainty and tension over the future of the PDP, the party held its national convention electing a new set of national officials on October 30 and 31, 2021, in Abuja.\n\nIn a bid to avoid rancour and further in fighting the party leaders, before the convention, achieved consensus candidates for 18 out of the 21 elective national offices of the party while agreement could not be reached for three offices.\n\nThe PDP National Consensus Convention produced former Senate President, Iyorchia Ayu, as the national chairman; former Deputy Governor Oyo state, Taofeek Arapaja, as deputy national chairman (South), while former governorship candidate of Yobe state, Umar Damagum, emerged deputy national chairman (North).\n\nSimilarly, Senator Samuel Anyanwu was elected national secretary; Setoji Kosheodo as deputy national secretary; Ahmed Mohammed as national treasurer; and Ndubisi David as deputy national treasurer.\n\nOther elected members of PDP NWC include: Umar Bature who was elected as national organising secretary; Ighoyota Amori as deputy national organising secretary; Daniel Woyegikuro as national financial secretary; Adamu Kamale as deputy national financial secretary; Debo Ologunagba as national publicity secretary; and Ibrahim Abdullahi as deputy national publicity secretary.\n\nOther are: Stella Effah-Attoe elected as national woman leader; Hajara Wanka as deputy national woman leader; Muhammed Suleiman as national youth leader; Timothy Osadolor as deputy national youth leader; Kamaldeen Ajibade as national legal adviser; Okechukwu Osuoha as deputy national legal adviser; Okechuckwu Daniel as national auditor; and Abdulrahman Mohammed as deputy national auditor.\n\nPDP won\u2019t break up \u2013 Ayu\n\nLike a man who understands what is expected of him, the national chairman-elect in his appreciation remarks said, \u201cMany people imagine that this convention will lead to the breakup of PDP. Those people who are dreaming like that, their dreams were misplaced.\n\n\u201cPDP will come back to unite our people, put them together, North and South, East and West. We will move ahead to win elections and develop this country. We did it before. We are going to do it again.\n\nAyu assured that he would emphasise internal democracy in running the affairs of the party noting that: \u201cOnce we start promoting internal democracy in the party, those defections will stop. They can\u2019t stop totally but they will be minimised and I believe that there are so many who left that will come back to PDP.\n\n\u201cMany of them are already calling me that they left in error. If you check the top list of APC members, most of them are former PDP elected governors, senators etc. I believe they will all come back.\n\n\u201cI believe PDP will get stronger and will be in very good shape in a few months. We will mobilise ourselves, mobilise the country and fight for the election as a democratic party.\n\n\u201cThis is what PDP is known for. We are not like the other party that imposes candidates on the people. I have done it in the past and I will continue to uphold democratic principles.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Ologunagba too\n\nAlso, the PDP national publicity secretary and two-term member of the House of Representatives, Hon Debo Ologunagba, said the new leadership of the party would retrieve the country from the failed All Progressives Congress (APC) and restore to PDP days of better security, economy among others.\n\nOlogunagba said, \u201cWhat I know and what we are projecting is the fact that we intend for PDP, the greatest party in Africa, to get gas to the tenets of democracy. Now, three things we are going to emphasize during this period knowing the state of this country right now is on unemployment, insecurity, and infrastructural decay.\n\n\u201cSo the major role for PDP today is because the people are waiting for hope. Like I always say, hope is a superpower. And the superpower is in PDP, where hope resides. So two things are going to be key in this communication mantra, it will be retrieved and restored.\u201d\n\nContinuing the publicity scribe elect said, \u201cWe want to restore the country to the PDP days when it was easy for you to go to bed at 10pm and take your car and drive down to Lokoja, go to another part and come back.\n\n\u201cWe want to restore where for instance, a bag of rice that was 10,000 seven years ago is now over 25,000. We want a situation where kids will go to school, and they won\u2019t be kidnapped. We want to restore fundamental freedoms that are guaranteed, for instance, the freedom to worship.\n\n\u201cNow, the first and the only duty of the government is the security and welfare You can\u2019t detach one from the other. The security is a foundation for the other.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that the party would partner with all major stakeholders and the Media to restore the country to greatness, adding that \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be reactive anymore. We\u2019re going to take the conversation war to the liars.\u201d\n\nHurdles before new leadership\n\nFollowing the emergence of the new leadership of the PDP, party faithful and other stakeholders have continue to set agenda for the executive especially as the 2023 general elections draw nearer.\n\nIt goes without saying that the Ayu-led NWC have many hurdles to cross in order to set the party on the path of a true opposition party as well as return it to winning ways.\n\nAccording to a political observer, the Ayu-led executive needed to jump these hurdles by first strengthening its internal democracy to avoid the party being consumed.\n\n\u201cFrom what played out during the build-up to the PDP National Elective Convention we saw and read how many aspirants who intended to run for one position or the other in the NWC were frustrated out of the contest.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, if such continues the party may drag itself into another crisis. So, the new leadership should ensure that there is a level playing field for every party member,\u201d the observer stated.\n\nSome political analysts have also concurred that the party\u2019s presidential primary election to elect a flag bearer for the 2023 election would make or mar the new leadership.\n\nThey recalled that the beginning of the problem for the Prince Secondus-led NWC was in 2018 after the presidential primary election in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, which produced former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThey noted that the primary election that will produce the party\u2019s 2023 Presidential candidate will not only determine the party\u2019s future but will also determine the future of the Ayu\u2019s NWC.\n\nThough it may be difficult, other analysts that are close to the party\u2019s hierarchy believe the Ayu-led NWC once inaugurated should free itself from the grips of some state governors.\n\nThis, according to them, remained one of the greatest hurdles for this NWC, almost all of them came to be because of the support of their governors.\n\nThe question is, when push comes to shove on whose side will the Ayu-led NWC be? On the said of the majority party members or a few party governors who finance them and the party?\n\nReconciliation sacrosanct says Mohammed\n\nMany people, within and outside the PDP are optimistic that the outcome of the convention would mark a turning point for the opposition party.\n\nHowever, for party that have gone through a lot and are still in crisis at the local government, state, zonal and national level this may not be unless there is true reconciliation.\n\nFor political analysts like Aminu Mohammed reconciliation is sacrosanct for the PDP to survive and perform well in future elections.\n\nMohammed in a chat with Blueprint Weekend said, \u201cMany of us that watch from the sideline, understand and even agree that for the new leadership of the PDP to succeed they must ensure true reconciliation.\n\n\u201cI say true reconciliation because of some politicians who use their term to only favour these who are loyal to them and push others out.\n\n\u201cIf Ayu and other members of the NWC want to get the party back on the path of winning elections, their immediate tasks will include reconciling aggrieved members across the country who are currently dissatisfied with the state of things within the party.\n\n\u201cMany party chieftains, including governors and national assembly members, are aggrieved and they are hoping and praying that this NWC will identify them and address their various concerns.\n\n\u201cEven though there are other critical expectations from them, to me Nigerians and even their members expect a true reconciliation in South-west, North-west, South-south and other places where there are issues among party faithful because this will set the pace for other actions and steps that will bring the party back to the light.\u201d\n\n\u2018You need to put APC on its toes\u2019\n\nMany Nigerians have argued that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has failed to play its role effectively as the major opposition party.\n\nThey claimed that the party was reactive and not proactive, adding that it failed to put the APC-led federal government on its toes as expected of a proactive opposition party in a growing democratic country like Nigeria.\n\nOne of these Nigerians is an analyst, Agboola Olawale Abdulrahman, who like many others was expecting the new leadership of the PDP to lead the party to ensure that it provides better alternatives to national issues.\n\nAbdulrahman, who is the chief executive officer of Safety Nigeria Network, told Blueprint Weekend that in the last six years the PDP has not been effective in its role as an opposition party.\n\nHe said, \u201cOver the years, what the PDP does is to issue a press statement to condemn government action or inaction, lambast and lament. I think they need to do more than that. They need to be very strategic in their approach and provide a better alternative to national issues.\n\n\u201cI expect this new leadership of the PDP to put on its thinking cap, take a critical look at the economy, education, security and others through conferences or programs to constructively come up with a position and better suggestions to how the government should address these issues.\n\n\u201cOpposition parties like the PDP should be proactive and put the country first by providing alternatives and reasonable suggestions that will help take the country out of the woods. So when the new PDP leadership ensures it is proactive and constructive perhaps Nigerians will forgive the party and consider the party in future elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cAyu would be NWC members are expected to lead an opposition party that will provide solutions or alternative ways to address Nigeria problems and not remain the old PDP that only laments or comments on issues. This is the only way they can put the APC on its toes.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Amidst continued shutdown of telecoms services in Katsina state, bandits have resorted to use of Radio Frequency Walkie Talkie Transceivers, Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Mustapha Inuwa has said.\n\nThe SSG stated this Thursday during a media parley at the Government House Katsina.\n\nAt the parley were Commissioner of Police in the state, Sanusi Buba and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security, Muhammad Ibrahim Katsina.\n\nAt the height of security challenge occasioned by activities of the bandits, the state government, via a Containment Order signed by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, had, among several measures, ordered the shutdown of telecommunications network in 13 local government areas considered the hotspots for banditry.\n\nThere were also outcries from some stakeholders who believed the shutdown had worsened the security situation of the people.\n\nFor instance, the state legislature recently tasked the Masari administration to up its game, saying the telecoms shutdown had left the people at the mercy of the bandits.\n\nSSG speaks in the contrary\n\nSpeaking to the contrary, however, SSG Inuwa said the telecoms ban had achieved the desired results in the state.\n\nWhile some level of successes had been recorded since the measures were put in place, Inuwa said the bandits had devised another means to carry out their acts.\n\nInuwa said: \u201cIn spite of the successes recorded, however, it is worthy to note that since the commencement of the Containment Order, the bandits\u2019 elements across the frontline local government areas have been unrelenting in devising new strategies aimed at circumventing the impact of the Containment Order.\n\n\u201cThe strategies range from attacking motorists/motorcyclists to siphon PMS from fuel tanks, to ransacking communities and coercing villages into sourcing PMS on their behalf. A recent and most worrisome move by the criminals is the observed acquisition of Radio Frequency Walkie Talkie Transceivers by the bandits.\u201d\n\nInuwa, who also chairs the security committee in the state, however, said security agents were on the trail of bandits using the walkie talkies.\n\nCasualties\n\nHe further said 480 suspected bandits were arrested between March and September 2021, 216 under prosecution and 42 others undergoing investigation.\n\nFrom September to date, he said, 244 suspects were arrested with 80 under prosecution and 33 under investigation.\n\nInuwa, who said there was a reduction in bandits\u2019 attacks since the Containment Order, also added that from September to date, 244 suspects were arrested with 33 under investigation and 80 under prosecution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Containment Order is a child of necessity, and has not been put in place to hurt or cause hardship to the citizens of the state. The driving objective was to arrest the emerging situation that was becoming a threat to peace, order and our collective well being.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also confirmed the killing of 213 people and abduction of over 676 innocent citizens within the period of four months across the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cA total of 475 persons were abducted between July and August while only 201 were abducted between September and October.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, between July and August, 97 armed banditry attacks were staged resulting in 130 deaths while only 56 incidents were recorded between September and October with 83 deaths.\n\n\u201cIncidents of cattle rustling also dropped significantly during the period as 1,347 cows, 345 sheep and 119 goats were stolen between July and August while 676 cows, 109 sheep and 160 goats were rustled between September and October.\u201d\n\nThe SSG, who was silent on the number of rescued victims, said the committee concentrated on the enforcement of Containment Order.\n\n\u201cFrom the 230 various bandits attacked we recorded, only 115 victims were injured, 213 lost their lives in the struggle.\u201d\n\nInuwa appealed to people of the state to give necessary support to the Containment Order by reporting informants and people with suspicious character to security agencies.\n\nHe said the order was adopted collectively by the North-west states to tackle the menace of banditry after series of security operations had failed to produce the desired result.\n\nIllela killings\n\nIn a related development, armed bandits have, in series of attacks, killed 43 people in five communities of Munwadata, Kalmalo, Sarma, Runji Tunbulunkun, and Tafkin Taramniya, all in Illela local government area of Sokoto state.\n\nGovernor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this Thursday when he led members of the state executive security chieftains as well as other top government officials on a condolence visit to the people of Illela, a border town of about 97 kilometers from the state capital.\n\nAccording to report, the marauders had attacked Kalmalo town and some villages near it in the wee hours of Monday at first instance, killing thirteen people.\n\nHowever, at the time of the governor\u2019s visit Wednesday afternoon the toll had risen to 43.\n\nThe report said a village head in one of the five villages was wounded during the night attack.\n\nTambuwal, had during the visit to Illela town told his bereaved audience that: \u201cWe\u2019re here to, on behalf of the government and good people of our dear state, to extend our heartfelt condolences on this unfortunate incident which claimed the lives of many of our citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is not a small occurrence. It is upsetting, this incident really touched us.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended the local government authorities, monarchs and community leaders for their lawful composition of a volunteer group working in tandem with the security operatives in the area.\n\nThe governor said the state government \u201cwill continue to frown upon the constitution of illegitimate volunteers,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe joint operations of legitimately constituted volunteers, who work closely with and under the supervision of security agencies, is the appropriate antidote to this crisis.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the people to remain undaunted by the recent attack, \u201cInstead, it should motivate you all to redouble your efforts, without seeking revenge, in securing your communities.\u201d\n\nThe governor assured them of sustained government assistance \u201cwhenever required\u201d, while praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, pray that God grant them eternal glory and forgive their shortcomings and sins while they were alive. May He also grant their families and relatives the fortitude to bear the losses of those who died just as we besiege Him to grant health and relief to those who sustained injuries and are recuperating at home and in the hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe, again, pray to God to continue to ensure that peace prevails in all our communities and across the country. I, once again, urge you to be patient and prayerful. I am delighted with the communal efforts at cooperation and prayers, led by the monarchs and community leaders here, being offered for the intercession of God in bringing us peace. Please, do not relent. May Allah grant us peace and peaceful coexistence,\u201d he further prayed.\n\nOgun\n\nMeanwhile, the Ogun State House of Assembly Thursday passed a resolution calling on the state government and all security agencies in the state to place a ban on street carnivals and the usage of fireworks during the coming yuletide.\n\nThe move, according to the lawmakers, was to forestall any security breach and also prevent further spread of COVID-19 among residents.\n\nThe passage of the resolution followed an extended debate by lawmakers leading to a motion moved by the Majority Leader, Yusuf Sheriff.\n\nThe motion was seconded by a member representing Ijebu North I State Constituency, Sylvester Abiodun and supported by all the lawmakers at the plenary presided over by Speaker Olakunle Oluomo in Abeokuta.\n\nThe lawmakers who spoke in unison said it was imperative for the state government to consider suspending any form of carnival or street procession which could further affect the security situation in the state, noting that such event organised in the past had resulted in clashes leading to breach of public peace.\n\nPassing the motion, Speaker Oluomo said the lawmakers\u2019 decision was in the best interest of the state, saying the Assembly as an institution would not allow any criminal act under the guise of carnivals, disrupt the relative peace in the state.\n\nHe also said there was need to avoid any act that could further spread COVID-19 among the residents.\n\nHe thereafter directed the Clerk and Head of Legislative Services, Mr. \u2018Deji Adeyemo to convey the Assembly\u2019s resolution to Governor Dapo Abiodun and all security formations.\n\nIn another development, Speaker Oluomo has announced that the Assembly would hold a stakeholders\u2019 forum on \u201cH.B. No. 072/OG/2021- the Ogun State Anti-Corruption Law, 2021- A Bill for a law to Establish the Ogun State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law and for connected purposes\u201d tomorrow, Friday, 19th November, 2021 at the Assembly Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nAccording to him, the public hearing would take place at 10:00am prompt; while all relevant stakeholders are enjoined to be seated by 9.30 am prompt.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to consider the request for the release of Nnamdi Kanu after meeting with a group of leaders from the South East under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats.\n\nHe made the pledge on Friday when he received the delegation led by a First Republic parliamentarian and former Minister of Aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, at the State House in Abuja.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country,\u201d the President was quoted as saying in a statement by his media adviser, Femi Adesina. \u201cThe implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Even In Death, Itunnu Babalola Must Get Justice, Says Dabiri-Erewa\n\nAn unconditional release of Kanu who is the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and currently standing trial, according to the President, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, he said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and was brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system.\n\n\u201cLet him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Amaechi who recently buried his wife and prayed that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nIn his remarks, Amaechi had described the situation in the South East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that businesses have collapsed, education was crumbling, fear has begun to manifest everywhere.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister alive, \u201che (Kanu) would no longer say the things he had been saying.\u201d\n\nThe former minister promised to control Kanu, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nHe stated that he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past twice, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire,\u201d Amaechi told his host.\n\nOther people in the visiting delegation were former Anambra State Governor, Chukwuemeka Ezeife; Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, Goddy Uwazurike; and Mr Tagbo Amaechi.\n\nKanu was first arrested in 2015 on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms, and improper importation of goods, among others.\n\nHe was initially detained and arraigned in court, but he fled the country in 2017 after he was granted bail for medical reasons.\n\nThe embattled IPOB leader was later sighted in Israel, but he was intercepted on June 27 and repatriated to Nigeria to face the charges for which he was arrested \u2013 about four years since he jumped bail.\n\nHis repatriation followed an operation conducted by Nigerian security operatives in collaboration with international partners.\n\nOn July 26, Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja adjourned the trial of Kanu until October 21 after the DSS failed to produce him in court.\n\nShe faulted the action of the security outfit and asked the prosecution to be diligent with dates whenever she gives one, stressing that it was important for Kanu to be present at his trial.\n\nThe judge had also made an order for regimented access to the defendant but declined the proposal of Kanu\u2019s counsel that he should be transferred to a correctional centre.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe United States government believes now is the time for major geopolitical players across the world to start treating Africa as one of them.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State, Mr Antony Blinken, stated this on Friday while addressing members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja.\n\n\u201cUnited States firmly believes that it is time to start treating Africa as a subject in geopolitics, and structure it as a major geopolitical player it has become \u2013 the facts speak for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Even In Death, Itunnu Babalola Must Get Justice, Says Dabiri-Erewa\n\nSpeaking specifically about Nigeria, the U.S. official highlighted some of the reasons it would not be out of place to call the nation the giant of Africa.\n\nAmong several other qualities, he noted Nigeria\u2019s cultural influence, saying people across the world listen to the Afrobeat music genre and watch Nollywood movies. He, however, believes there are areas that require improvements.\n\n\u201dYour strengths are undeniable \u2013 a dynamic democracy, a robust economy, and a very powerful civil society. Challenges you face here are undeniable as well, including the disruption and insecurity caused by terrorism,\u201d said Blinken.\n\n\u201cWhat happens here in Nigeria is felt around the world, and that, in a nutshell, is why I came to Abuja. United States knows that in most of the challenges and opportunities we face, Africa will make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t achieve our goals around the world \u2013 whether ending the COVID-19 pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate crisis\u2026 without the leadership of the African governments, institutions, and citizens.\n\n\u201cCountries like Nigeria, not just global leaders, they are increasingly prominent around the world beyond this region, and they are deserving a permanent seat wherever the most consequential issues are discussed.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Backsliding\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of State stressed the need to foster democracy across the African continent and appealed to its leaders to stop interfering with democratic processes.\n\nAlluding to the threats to democracy also in the U.S., he stated that it was important for countries in every part of the world to share best practices.\n\nBlinken also asked them to make public pledges to hold each other accountable, as well as show how democracy can deliver what citizens want quickly and effectively.\n\nHe explained that boosting democracy was one of the major reasons why U.S. President Joe Biden would host a democratic summit in December.\n\n\u201cThe recession of democracy in many places in Africa cannot be denied, and it is not the will of the people,\u201d the U.S. official decried. \u201cSurvey after survey in countries across the continent show that the people of Africa \u2013 either Ghanaian, or Zambian, or Ugandan, or Tanzanian \u2013 support democracy when given the choice between multi-party elections or strong man rule, one-party state or military control; they choose multi-party elections.\n\n\u201cThat makes it more important that leaders show leadership and stop democratic backsliding that is wiping away their citizens\u2019 aspirations. I want to emphasise that democratic backsliding is not just an African problem, it is a global problem.\n\n\u201cMy own country is struggling with threats to democracy and the solutions to those threats will come as much from Africa as from anywhere.\u201d",

The criminals attacked the town in the early hours of this morning through multiple flanks with unconfirmed number of ISWAP foot soldiers on Gun Trucks. They were, however subdued by the overwhelming fire power of the vigilant troops.\n\n\u201cIn the following offensive, troops engaged the terrorists with high volume of fire, forcing them to withdraw in disarray. Though, the actual number of casualty could not be immediately ascertained as at the time of this release, however blood stains were reportedly seen on the terrorists\u2019 withdrawal routes.\n\n\u201cThis latest operational feat, attests to the continuous combat readiness and troops renewed vigor to effectively deny these criminal elements freedom of action. Additionally, this clearly signifies the resolve of the good people of the North East who have chosen to take ownership of the ongoing counter insurgency operations by providing credible information on the cladestine activities of the criminals.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya salutes the gallantry displayed by troops, while urging them across all theatres of operations to sustain the current operational tempo.\u201d",

However, the accused, who happens to be related to an Ivorian policeman, had asked her to drop the case but she insisted on getting justice.\n\nUsing a pseudonym, she went on to file charges against him but, mysteriously, the robbery charge which she filed was flipped to a case of human trafficking against her.\n\nIn a statement issued this week by the Nigerian Embassy in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, the mission said the deceased had been diagnosed with diabetes and went into a diabetic coma at a hospital in Bondoukou, north-central Cote d\u2019Ivoire on Friday, November 12th, 2021.\n\nThe embassy said she had been sentenced to a 10-year prison term and that the consular section had paid her visits to commence the appeal on her sentencing before she died.\n\nAbike Dabire Erewa, Chairperson of the Nigeriansin Diaspora Commission, discusses what the Nigerian government is doing to get justice for the late Ms. Paul and compensation for the family that she left behind.",

          "text": "Belarusian state media reports that migrants and refugees were moved into a heated warehouse not far from the border.\n\nBelarus has moved migrants and refugees away from the main camps at the Polish border, according to Belarusian media and officials, in a change of tack that could help ease a crisis that has spiralled in recent weeks.\n\nThousands of refugees and migrants have tried to reach the European Union via Belarus since the summer.\n\nEuropean countries have accused Belarus of deliberately creating the crisis by flying in people from the Middle East and pushing them to attempt to cross its borders into Poland and Lithuania. Minsk has rejected the allegations.\n\nBelarusian state-run media reported on Thursday that many asylum seekers had moved into a heated warehouse not far from the border, emptying out a makeshift camp.\n\nA spokesperson for the Polish border guard said the camps on the frontier in western Belarus were completely empty on Thursday, which a Belarusian press officer confirmed, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\n\u201cThese camps are now empty, the migrants have been taken most likely to the transport-logistics centre, which is not far from the Bruzgi border crossing,\u201d the Polish spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThere were no other such camps \u2026 but there were groups appearing in other places trying to cross the border. We\u2019ll see what happens in the next hours.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after a flurry of diplomatic activity. Earlier this week, Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone twice to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, normally shunned by European leaders.\n\nAnd Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called on him to start a dialogue with his opponents \u2013 who swiftly rejected the idea unless Lukashenko freed political prisoners.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also spoke to Putin about the crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission and Germany rejected a proposal by Belarus that European Union countries take in thousands of the refugees and asylum seekers currently in its territory.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a spokeswoman for President Alexander Lukashenko was quoted as saying said during the first call with Merkel, Minsk had asked the European Union to take in 2,000 refugees and migrants.\n\n\u201cThe European Union creates a humanitarian corridor for the 2,000 refugees who are in the camp. We undertake to facilitate \u2013 as far as possible and if they wish \u2013 the remaining 5,000 to return to their homeland,\u201d Natalya Eismont was quoted as saying, summarising the plan.\n\nHowever, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer outright rejected the proposal.\n\n\u201cIf we took in refugees, if we bowed to the pressure and said \u2018we are taking refugees into European countries\u2019, then this would mean implementing the very basis of this perfidious strategy,\u201d Seehofer said on Thursday at a news conference in Warsaw.\n\nShortly before the plan was announced, the European Commission had said there could be no negotiation with Belarus over the plight of the migrants.\n\nIt declined to comment on the proposal, with a spokesperson saying: \u201cWe made our position very clear \u2013 this is an artificially created, state-orchestrated crisis and it is a responsibility of Lukashenko\u2019s regime to stop it and to solve it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Iraqis who have camped for weeks at the border boarded a Baghdad-bound repatriation flight on Thursday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, only about 400 refugees have agreed to return home. In all, to be precise, in the plane that left today there were 374 passengers, mostly Iraqi citizens,\u201d Eismont said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fulfilling our promises, while the EU has not yet fulfilled a single obligation,\u201d she added.\n\nThe EU recently expanded sanctions against Belarus due to the migration crisis.\n\nThe bloc has accused Lukashenko\u2019s government of having lured the asylum seekers and refugees to Belarus\u2019s border with Poland in revenge for earlier sanctions over a disputed August 2020 election, which gave him a sixth term and sparked mass anti-government protests.\n\nMinsk has rejected that as absurd and said the EU must lift sanctions if it wants the crisis resolved.\n\nAid groups have said at least 11 asylum seekers and refugees have died on both sides of the border since the crisis began earlier this year.\n\nAlongside Poland, fellow eastern EU member states Latvia and Lithuania have refused to accept asylum seekers and refugees aiming to enter the bloc via Belarus.\n\nPeople who have managed to enter the EU are reluctant to turn back, and many are effectively trapped in forested borderlands as winter sets in.",

I have always done that.\u201d\n\nPromes returned to Spartak Moscow after a successful first stint at the club between 2014 and 2018. During that period, in 2017, he was named Russia\u2019s footballer of the year.\n\nHe played for Sevilla in Spain\u2019s La Liga and Ajax in the Dutch Eredivisie before going back to Spartak.\n\nHe has scored seven goals in 50 appearances for the Dutch national team since his debut in 2014.\n\nHe last appeared for the Netherlands in their upset 2-0 defeat against the Czech Republic in an Euro 2020 match in June.\n\nIn October this year, Dutch national coach Louis van Gaal said he wouldn\u2019t select Promes for the team while until the criminal case against him was ongoing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I select players who are involved in such matters,\u201d van Gaal said.",
