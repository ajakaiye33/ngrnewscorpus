          "text": "The Senate, on Monday, condemned the poor budgetary provision for the Ajaokuta Steel Complex in Kogi State and blamed the development for the inability of the firm to take off.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Solid Minerals, Mines, Steel Development and Metallurgy made the condemnation when officials of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development appeared before it to defend the 2022 budget.\n\nThe panel also frowned on the practice whereby the executive arm of government sends to the National Assembly on a yearly basis envelope budgets for approval.\n\nIt insisted that the abandonment of the Ajaokuta Steel project through the non-provision of required budgetary votes on a yearly basis was not the best for the country.\n\nTrouble started when the Minister of State in the ministry, Dr Uchechukwu Ogah, said the Federal Government had proposed N23.4bn for the ministry as its 2022 budget estimates.\n\nOgah said out of the proposal, N10bn was for personnel cost, N1.47bn for overhead and N11bn for capital projects.\n\nMembers of the committee decried the meagre budgetary allocation for the solid minerals sector, which they insisted should rank second after oil and gas.\n\nThe Chairman of the committee, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, condemned the idea of envelope budgeting.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe yearly ritual called budget is garbage in, garbage out, which will not take the country to anywhere as far as the required diversification is concerned.\n\n\u201cThe type of budgeting process being implemented in this country over the years is stereotypical. It is wrong for a budget to be conceptualised in the ministry, enveloped and forwarded to the National Assembly for approval.\u201d\n\nSenator Smart Adeyemi said the economic team of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was clearly out of tune with the reality on the ground as regards what Nigerians needed.\n\nAdeyemi stated, \u201cHow on earth would a minister propose N82bn for the procurement of mosquito nets and a sector as important as solid minerals given N10bn or N11bn?\n\n\u201cThe Ajaokuta Steel Complex that can give jobs to about 50,000 Nigerians is lying fallow in a country with an army of unemployed youths, who can stage a revolution at any time.\n\n\u201cNigeria is bleeding from this envelope form of budgeting that is riddled with repetition of line items and allocations on a yearly basis.\n\n\u201cThe government may be building infrastructure, but building infrastructure is not as good as creating wealth through the diversification of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe best way of doing this is to remove whatever bottleneck that is hindering the continuation of work on the Ajaokuta Steel Complex and get it completed.\u201d\n\nThe minister, in his response, said the idea of envelope budgeting was not the creation of the ministry as it affected other government agencies.\n\nHe also solicited the intervention of the federal lawmakers to put an end to the envelope budgeting regime.\n\nOgah said, \u201cMy appeal to you distinguished senators on the current model of budgeting is for the National Assembly to seek the attention of the President.\n\n\u201cOperating the envelope system, as far as the yearly budget is concerned, doesn\u2019t make one think out of the box. It makes one looks stupid.\n\n\u201cWe have the passion to drive the development of the country and transform into reality the vision of Mr President like other patriotic Nigerians in one public office or the other.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite the envelope budgeting and lean resources, the ministry had changed the narrative of low internally generated revenue to very appreciable figures now.\n\n\u201cIn the recent past, it used to be N2bn on a yearly basis, but it has increased to N6.2bn now with a target of hitting N10bn by the end of the year,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Fuel queues resurface in Nasarawa, Abuja, Niger, marketers hike price",
          "text": "Black marketers, on Monday, positioned themselves in strategic locations in parts of the Federal Capital Territory, hawking Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, in jerrycans to interested motorists and other consumers as the scarcity of the product resurfaced.\n\nAlso, queues of desperate motorists were noticeable in some parts of neighbouring states such as Nasarawa and Niger.\n\nAlthough some filling stations dispensed the commodity in the morning, it was reliably gathered that there were supply hiccups, which made many retailers to halt the sale of petrol.\n\nRetailers claimed that the ex-depot price of the commodity had been increased by private tank farm owners from the recommended N148 and N149.5/litre to between N153 and N155/litre.\n\nThis, according to them, has made many retailers to suspend the sale of the product coupled with their inability to get the required quantity, a development that led to the emergence of the black marketers.\n\nSome hawkers were spotted in front of the Total filling station, opposite the headquarters of the Nigeria Police Force in the Abuja city centre.\n\nThey sold the product in 10-litre jerrycans for between N2,000 and N2,500 to motorists, who could not stay in queues at filling stations.\n\nSome black marketers were also seen at the Kubwa end of the Kubwa-Zuba Expressway around Nipco filling station.\n\nA senior official of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria told one of our correspondents that the partial scarcity in Abuja could be due to product hoarding by tank farm owners, who recently increased the price.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stated, \u201cPetrol scarcity is likely going to happen, because there is supply drop and some of the private tank farms have increased their price from the previous price. We don\u2019t know what is causing the problem.\n\n\u201cIf it continues like that, there will be problems. Most of the tank farm owners are always sceptical about pushing out products towards the end of the month.\n\n\u201cAlso, you know we are approaching the festive period. So, it is like there is product hoarding on their part. There is no communication yet from the government on this.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the National Public Relations Officer, IPMAN, Chief Ukadike Chinedu, denied that the marketers were involved in hoarding petrol.\n\nHe said, \u201cMarketers will sell when they have products. Availability of products determines the operation of marketers, who want to sell at any given time to maximise profits.\n\n\u201cBut right now, adequate supply is not there. Supply is the most important thing. We buy from tank farms and from the Port Harcourt refinery\u2019s depot. We are having supply issues due to pricing.\n\n\u201cThe cost of PMS in the private depots before was N149.5 per litre, but now they are selling at between N153 and N156 per litre.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC depots are not loading enough to satisfy the numerous consumers of petrol across the country. Some of the depots don\u2019t have products because of pipeline vandalism. Also, the roads are bad to convey products.\u201d\n\nChinedu stated that insufficient supply from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation depots might further result in higher prices by private depot owners and that this might lead to a complete halt in sale by retailers.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf there is insufficiency from the NNPC, this price increase from N149 to N155 by private depots will give a wrong signal to anybody in the oil and gas business that any moment from now, it may get to N160/litre.\n\n\u201cAnd if it gets to N160/litre, we will not be able to sell at the current N162 to N165 official pump price. This is because we must factor in our transportation cost, logistics and the maintenance of our filling stations, among others.\u201d\n\nWhen told that the government insisted that it had enough products to keep the country wet for months, Chinedu maintained that private depot owners had increased the PMS price and that this was creating uncertainty in supply.\n\nThe IPMAN PRO stated, \u201cLike I told you earlier, most of the private tank farms are selling PMS at N153, N154 or N155 as against the N149, which it was sold recently. This is creating a lot of panic and there is serious uncertainty.\n\n\u201cMost of the tank farms in the South-East do not have products. I want to tell you again that there is an issue. The government, through the NNPC, has not increased the price of petrol, but I\u2019m telling you that private tank farms have increased the ex-depot price.\u201d\n\nA senior official of the Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria asked our correspondent to report what the retailers said about pricing, but declined to confirm or deny their claims.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to report what they told you? Look, there are issues in the downstream sector; that\u2019s all I can say for now,\u201d the official stated.\n\nHowever, officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company denied any increase in petrol price, insisting that there had been no official directive on the issue.\n\nThe NNPC has been the sole importer of petrol into Nigeria for more than four years. Other marketers stopped PMS importation due to their inability to access foreign exchange to make purchase.\n\n\u201cI was with the chairman of IPMAN over the weekend and there is no such thing as petrol price increase,\u201d a senior official of the corporation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stated.\n\n\u201cIf there is a price increase, there will be a policy statement about it and it will be announced,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe NNPC official insisted that the corporation had enough of the product and stressed that the queues would completely disappear in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cIt is something that will go away in the shortest possible time. Just give it a little time, up till tomorrow (Tuesday),\u201d the official said.\n\nThe source stated that the queues would completely clear out in the Abuja city centre, as they had started disappearing in some suburbs of the FCT and neighbouring states by Monday evening.\n\n\u201cThere is enough supply and the NNPC has sufficient products to last not just November and December, but beyond January. So, if some people are speculating and trying to make an issue out of it, such people will lose,\u201d the official added.\n\nOther operators confirmed that there was no official increase in the pump price of petrol, but admitted that some of the over 200 private depot owners across the country had raised their price due to issues around logistics, among others.\n\nThe Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, Mr Clement Isong, who spoke with one of our correspondents on Monday, said there was no supply issue in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe have stocks in Lagos; we are expecting more product supply from the NNPC, and there is no need to panic-buy,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Editors urge govt to create safe, enabling environment for journalists",
          "text": "Ask security agents to find missing Vanguard journalist\n\nAs the world marks the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against journalists today, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has called on government at all levels to make deliberate and sustained efforts to promote a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their work freely.\n\nThe editors also reminded the government that attacks on journalists have a destructive effect on the dissemination of information and helpful debate in a democratic space. They expressed concern over the way journalists are increasingly subjected to all forms of threats, including kidnapping, torture, physical attacks and other forms of harassment.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday by NGE\u2019s President, Mustapha Isah and the General Secretary, Iyobosa Uuwgiaren, the professional group also called on the security agencies to immediately locate a missing journalist, Mr Tordue Salem; investigate all forms of attacks against journalists \u2013 with the sole purpose of prosecuting the offenders.\n\nMr. Salem, a journalist with Vanguard Newspapers, who covers the House of Representatives, has been declared missing in the past few weeks.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly had proclaimed every November 2 as the \u2018\u2019International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists\u2019\u2019 in General Assembly Resolution A/RES/68/163. The resolution urges Member States to implement definite measures countering the present culture of impunity.\n\nThis milestone resolution condemns all attacks and violence against journalists and media workers. And also urges the Member States to do their utmost to prevent violence against journalists and media workers, to ensure accountability, bring to justice perpetrators of crimes against journalists and media workers, and ensure that victims have access to appropriate remedies.\n\nWhile expressing worry over refusal by the appropriate authorities to properly investigate threats of violence and attacks against journalists in the past few years, the NGE said that it is very troubling for an adult like Mr Salem to just vanish into thin air for the past three weeks without a trace.\n\nGiving instances of attacks against journalists in the past two years, the Guild said that on October 11, last year, Gimba Kakanda, a columnist with Daily Trust newspaper, was attacked by police officers, when he tried to pick up his car near the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development in Abuja.\n\nAlso on October 11, 2020, the police violently attacked Arise Television cameraman, Francis Ogbonna, and a reporter, Ferdinand Duruoha, while they were covering protests in Abuja.\n\n\u2018\u2019We also have on record how some unknown gunmen \u2013 on October 12, 2020, attacked Television Continental presenter, Theophilus Elamah, in the chest and forced him and the cameraman he was working with, Julius Idowu, to leave the protest area.\n\n\u2018\u2019On October 17, 2020, Oluwatoyin Yusuf, a reporter with the Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC), was attacked by unidentified men while covering a protest in Oshogbo, the state capital.\n\n\u2018\u2019Also on October 21, 2020 in Lagos, unknown men attacked the offices of Lagos State Television (LTV) and the TVC broadcaster.\n\n\u2018\u2019While covering the October 21 attack on TVC, Ayo Makinde, a reporter with the privately owned Channels Television broadcaster was assaulted by unidentified people\u2019\u2019, the Guild added.\n\nThe NGE reminded politicians, government officials and security agents that while they like to present their success stories and their opinions, using the media to gain public respect and widen their authority; the media\u2019s role is to question them critically, and hold them accountable to the people.\n\n\u2018\u2019If journalists are to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities earnestly and robustly, politicians, government officials and security agents must treat them respectfully. They must ensure regular flow of information and frank dispassionate approach in dealing with journalists\u2019\u2019, the editors stated.\n\nAside from deadly attacks, the NGE said that it has also noticed \u2018\u2019anti-media rhetoric\u2019\u2019 by some politicians and senior government officials \u2013 that is hostile to the media.\n\nAccording to the NGE, \u2018\u2019This anti-media rhetoric has lent a hand to a sense of resentment against journalists, and contributed hugely to questioning of trust in the media, and creating a susceptible working atmosphere for journalists and media workers.\n\n\u2018\u2019We have also noticed that some members of the National Assembly are using prerogatives of so-called \u2018fake news\u2019 as a doubtful justification to propose amendments to media laws \u2013 with intention to criminalise journalism practice in Nigeria, curtail freedom of expression, suffocate democratic space and muzzle journalists in particular.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe editors reiterated that the media is neither a political rival nor opponent of the government; but an institution recognises by Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution to at all times hold public officials accountable to the people and promotes good governance.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The youth wing of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the highest socio-cultural organization in Igbo land, has joined in lending voices on the demand for the resignation of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice,Abubakar Malami, on the alleged invasion of the Abuja home of a Supreme Court Justice, Mary Odili by armed security men.\n\nThe Igbo youths tasked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government of Nigeria, on thorough investigation of the incident.\n\nRecall that Justice Odili\u2019s family residence at lmo Rivers Street in Maitama was said to have been besieged by fully armed plain-clothed security men for undisclosed reasons at about 5pm of Friday, October 29.\n\nSecurity operatives guarding the house were said to have resisted the take over of the house without a court order or instructions from the above.\n\nHowever, a statement by the acting National Youth Leader, Onwasoanya FCC Jones, and made available to DAILY POST on Monday, the youth wing, also requested that beyond calls for the resignation of Abubakar Malami, government should get to the roots of the investigation and bring all the security officers involved in the attempted assassination\u201d to book.\n\nAccording to the Ohanaeze youths, \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t one of those unresolved and endless investigations, the federal government should for once prove that a high profile investigation can be conclusive and that public officials could be held responsible for their excesses\u201d.\n\nThe Igbo youth group regretted over the ugly scenario, describing the alleged invasion as a \u201cIgbophobic inspired attack on the judiciary.\n\nIt claimed, \u201cJustice Mary Odiii couldn\u2019t have committed any other crime known to our laws, except the fact that she is Igbo, bears an Igbo name and she had managed by pure dint of hard work and integrity to rise to an enviable height in her chosen career as a justice of the supreme court\u201d.\n\nThe Ohanaeze youths further argued that if the operation wasn\u2019t aimed at something sinister, those involved would have come out boldly to own it up.\n\nAccording to the youth wing, \u201cthe mission was to abduct the honorable Justice and kill her off because she is Igbo and she is occupying a very sensitive position in one of the arms of government. Fortunately, she was smart enough to resist that obnoxious attempt on her life, hence, all the agencies and individuals involved have distanced themselves from the operation. Sadly, that is the same way, everyone of them would have denied culpability, if we had woken up to hear that some uniform wearing operatives abducted her and killed her off.\u201d\n\nParts of the statement said, \u201cthe Igbophobic cabal in the current Federal Government cannot stomach the fact that an Igbo has the slightest chance of heading any arm of the Federal Government, while they are still in charge, hence, they could go the extreme level of attempting to abduct her and possibly assassinate her in the pretext of trying to conduct a search on her house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe denials from all affected agencies even when there is a strong evidence linking the Ministry of Justice to the invasion confirms one of two things about the head of that Ministry; either he is incompetent, hence, not in charge, or that he is being dishonest about the whole incident. In either case, Malam Malami should resign as the Attorney-General of the Federation or the President sacks him from that position, because he has continued to use that office to advance his Igbophobic agenda rather than serve the lawful interests of our dear Republic.\u201d",

          "title": "Lagos APC congress followed guidelines, says Oladejo",
          "text": "The Publicity Secretary Secretary of All Progressive Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Seye Oladejo, has defended its state congress recently held at Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Onikan, Lagos.\n\nEchoing Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s remarks about the successful exercise, he said it was fair, non-controversial, seamless, credible and devoid of acrimony and violence.\n\n\u201cOur state Congress was held, based on rules, guidelines and constitution of our party, and members are conversant with these rules,\u201d he said on a live MITV programme.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNo fewer than 1,615 delegates converged on the approved venue to elect former House of Representatives member Pastor Cornelius Ojelabi as chairman and other party officers.\n\nThese delegates, said Oladejo, were made up of statutory delegates, including political office holders- former and current governors and deputy governors, members of National Assembly and Lagos State House of Assembly, local government chairmen and councillors- and five delegates per ward from 245 wards.\n\nHe explained that the delegates from the wards were elected at the ward congreses that took place before the local government congresses.\n\nMore importantly, the congress was conducted by a seven-man committee headed by Chief Adebayo Adelabu. The congress, Oladejo emphasised, was witnessed by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials.\n\nHe frowned at some party chieftains who purportedly conducted their own state congresses outside Onikan, saying that their claims are nebulous and laughable.\n\nOladejo possed some questions to the recaltricant members: how did they arrive at their delegates\u2019 list? who are their statutory delegates? who conducted the congresses for them?\n\nChiding them for conducting unlawful congresses outside party rules and guidelines, he said the events lacked basis and credibility, adding that their attitude smacked of impunity and indiscipline.\n\n\u201cWhen you join a party, you abide by the rules and regulations of the party,\u201d he fumed.\n\nTo that extent, Oladejo maintained that any event outside the Onikan Congress amounted to a boycott, admonishing that \u201d when you are protesting, you do that within the party.\u201d\n\nThere are allegations of lack of internal democracy and level playing ground in the fold. The spokesman disagreed, saying that they cannot be proved. He recalled that the chapter had opted for consensus, which is supported by the constitution of APC.\n\nSince it was a delegate congress, it was not an all-comers event, he said.\n\nHaving satisfied the laid down regulations, Oladejo said he is confident that the national secretariat of the ruling party will uphold the congress conducted by Adelabu.\n\nHe added:\u201d37 forms were received by the Adelabu Committee. Two people submitted for chairman. One was screened out by the committee; he was not qualified.\u201d\n\nOladejo said the sale of forms was open, following the adverts in the media spelling out the guidelines, recalling that aspirants were allowed to buy forms either at the national secretariat of the party at Abuja or the Lagos party office. He said the aspirants were, however, expected to submit their forms to the committee.\n\nBerating the critics for negligence, he said: \u201cThey did not submit their forms to the committee. They did not do screening. Technically, they boycotted. That is not a good strategy.\u201d\n\nOn the contest, Oladejo said:\u201dOne person contested for each post because there was consensus, a product of agreement devoid of acrimony.\u201d\n\nEmphasising the validity of the option, the publicity secretary said balancing was considered, stressing that the structures of the party, including elders, women and youths, were totally involved in the congress, in a bid to lay a solid foundation for the continued victory of the party in the state.\n\nHe maintained that a core element of validity of the process was that the umpire at the congress was sent to Lagos by the National Caretaker Committee, led by Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cThe committe came with the list of delegates from Abuja. They also approved the venue,\u201d he added.\n\nOladejo said the criticisms by few groups that have constituted themselves into opposition camps were in bad faith. The publicity secretary said their arrowheads suffered from internal displacement. \u201cThey ought to have stayed in the party and ventilated their grievances,\u201d he added.\n\nOladejo took exception to the antics of one of the aggrieved chieftains, a former state vice chairman, who he described as a serial contender for party chairman, for having an exergerrated sense of himself.\n\nHe lamented that the chieftain was building his political career on a false sense of importance.\n\nHe also rejected what he described as the divisive and sectional agenda of the \u2018Lagos-for-Lagos.\u2019 He said despite the fact that its name looks flamboyant and colourful, it\u2019s philosophy of division is unpopular, weak and counter-productive.\n\nOladejo stressed:\u201dLagos is a cosmopolitan coastal state with attraction to commerce. It is the former federal capital that has hosted many Nigerians from across the federation.\n\n\u201cThe founding fathers of Lagos were kind and accommodating. The prosperity of Lagos attracted many people who have contributed to the progress of the state. There is no family in Nigeria that does not have a representative in Lagos.\u201d\n\nIn his reckoning, Lagos that has become a model for socio-economic and political development and upliftment cannot succumb to politics of discrimination, alienation and exclusion.\n\nNoting that the mood of Lagosians does not accommodate sectional politics in the Centre of Excellence, he said there is no need for a resident to have a certificate of origin to live in Lagos.\n\nTo Oladejo, Lagos-for-Lagos is also fighting the elders and pushing for generational shift without wanting to work to earn power.\n\nHe said Lagos APC believes in the youths who bubble with energy. But, it also accords respect to elders because of their experience and wisdom. What the ruling party has been doing, said Oladejo, is to tap from the mixture of old and young, thereby propelling the platform forward.\n\nHe fired salvos at those he called unknown sponsors of the group and prophets of doom and frustration drumming for its members underground. He challenged them to openly identify with the surrogate group and risk becoming Internally Displaced Politicians. He predicted that their crowd will soon disperse.\n\nOladejo added:\u201dIt is about 2023. By next year, the wheat will be separated from the chaff.\u201d\n\nOn the quest for youth participation, the publicity secretary said the clamour is in order. He noted that the youths are in the majority. But, Oladejo clarified that there is no scientific evidence that youths will do better in government than elders.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cWe go for a mix. What elders will see, the youths may not see it. We need the right combination.\u201d\n\nIn his view, those complaining outside cannot dwarf the collective strength of majority who were behind the Onikan congress.\n\nHe said at the carnival-like congress, senators and House of Representatives members, who were present, had the pleasure of personally nominating the candidates for party offices.\n\nHe noted that organisers of congresses outside Onikan claimed to have a mammoth crowd, which was easy to mobilise in a way crowds are mobilised these days.\n\nThe spokesman also dissected the allegation of imposition, saying that it is unfounded. He said the camp outside resorted to the blackmail by branding consensus as imposition, oblivious of the fact that the party had put its house in order ahead of the congress. He pointed out that some party officers who had held party offices for 12 years yielded their seats to new officers.\n\n\u201cWe had ward, local government and now, state congresses. There were protests and appeal committees. They have turned in their reports,\u201d he said\n\nThen, he queried: \u201cHow did the leadership of their Lagos-for-Lagos even emerge?\u201d\n\nOladejo said since the protesting groups have sponsors, the members are in fairly lucrative careers. However, he added that their position cannot be sustained, stressing that they have to come back home to embrace internal reconciliation mechanism.\n\nOladejo said Lagos APC has waved the olive branch. But, he added:\u201dThe aggrieved must be willing. They should stop heating up the polity and desist from making inflammatory statements.\u201d\n\nNoting that the aggrieved can go to court to press their claims, he said the party will want all reconciliation mechanisms explored before anybody can go to court.\n\nOladejo said Lagos is lucky to have Sanwo-Olu at the helm of affairs. Lauding his achievements, he said the governor is on course, adding: \u201cHe has overcome Covid pandemic and #EndSARS and he is not distracted.\u201d\n\nHe boasted that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is no match for the ruling party. \u201cOpposition party is not in existence in Lagos State,\u201d he maintained.\n\nFollowing the successful congress, Oladejo said the belief of majority of party members in the party structures has been sustained.\n\nOladejo, who was re-elected as publicity secretary, said delegates made a good choice by voting Ojelabi as chairman. He also lauded the composition of the new executive committee, saying that it is made up of experienced stalwarts.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cThe new exco is made up of experienced people. Honourable Cornelius Ojelabi is a complete package; former Ojo Council chairman, House of Representatives member and former Commissioner for Rural Development, a true son of Awori, a grassroots politician. In the team are experienced politicians-former lawmakers, commissioners.\u201d",

          "title": "Why crisis persists between Kwara governor, minister",
          "text": "Yakubu Danladi-Salihu, engineer and Speaker of Kwara State House of Assembly, represents Ilesha-Gwanara Constituency. He spoke with reporters on the Legislative/Executive relations and the rift between Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq and Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed, and other partisan issues: Excerpts:\n\nYou are one of the youngest Speakers in Nigeria. How are you able to manage the House, despite being a first term lawmaker?\n\nFirstly, I have been handling the affairs of the House with the fear of God. I see and carry myself as just the first among equals. We relate as brothers, colleagues and compatriots who have a duty to the people of the state who have entrusted us with their mandates. In everything we do, I go for consensus building and we all look after one other. This has been the secret. I am always grateful that we place the interest of the state above group, sectional or personal interest. This has made us thick as a team. I don\u2019t see myself as superior to any of my colleagues and I try to act as their chief servant. Many of them treat me as their little brother who must succeed. I cannot thank them enough.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhat would you say have been the achievements of this House?\n\nThis 9th Assembly is a unique one. It is unlike any other Assembly in the recent history of the state because of the peculiar nature of our emergence. We came through a political revolution called Otoge. What we have done is to ensure that we work with the exec urging and the judiciary to deliver on the mandate of our people. First and foremost, the Assembly has been a strategic partner for success to the executive. We cooperate without jettisoning legislative independence, engendering mutual respect and synergy. This House has passed.\n\n18 bills, 39 public spirited motions. Many of our bills have direct impacts on the wellbeing of the masses and equitable distribution of wealth. An example is the Kwara State Social Investment Programme Bill, which we worked on. Today, tens of thousands of our people are being lifted out of poverty. Apart from this, we conduct adequate oversight functions to ensure judicious use of public resources. In doing this, we are mindful of the fact that this is a young as administration led by a very sincere and committed patriot, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, who is very passionate about the well-being of the people. Of course, this is glaring in the achievements across various sectors like health, education, water, social development, road, and others. We have also worked on some bills that will really transform Kwara State. Take the Kwara State Education Trust Fund, which has also been assented to by the Governor. By the time the Trust Fund becomes operational, public education will never be the same again. The Kwara State Sports Commission Bill is another milestone. Same for the Geographic Information Service (GIS) Bill which has also become law and will soon go into full implementation after some other preliminary works have been done. Our members remain very close to the grassroots.\n\nThe Otoge tsunami in Kwara was one of its kind in Nigeria in 2019. Would you say the APC administration has justified the confidence reposed in you?\n\nExcept for those who want to play politics, there is no part of Kwara State where the programmes and activities of this government is not being felt. It has never been so before. There is no local government you won\u2019t find one or two projects in various sectors. Currently now, there is massive rehabilitation or remodelling of schools across the state. This has never been so. This is coming just a few months after our people benefitted hugely from a very transparent, child-focused teachers\u2019 recruitment process. It is the best we have ever seen in this state. Go and ask anyone. There is no ward where you will not find beneficiaries of the social safety programme of the administration. In Baruten where I come from, we have never had it so good. In the next few weeks or so, the government would have completed and possibly Commission a brand new radio station. It is the first radio station in the whole of Kwara North senatorial district. Before now, we relied on radio from Benin Republic. The region has never had benefited from public water interventions as we have seen under this administration; it is same for health facilities. The results are glaring. The popular 33km Ilesha Gwanara road is now undergoing construction up to asphalt level. This is a road that had been abandoned after over N1bn had been stolen under the last administration. I can go on and on. It is important to note however that the Otoge revolution goes beyond the great things we are seeing in the area of basic amenities. It is also about the dignity of the human person. Kwarans are no longer subservient to anyone. We are no longer referred to as slaves to any political warlord. Every politician now knows that the people matter.\n\nSenator Saraki said a few days ago that the people of Kwara State have regretted their decision on Otoge. What do you say to that?\n\nHe was actually insulting the people of Kwara State. Senator Saraki himself does not believe what he was saying. He knows there is a clear cut positive difference in the Kwara of 2019 and Kwara of today. In 2019, Kwara was a pariah state on many fronts. I\u2019m sure you have heard the story of how we were humiliated out of UBEC because the government that Senator Saraki inspired diverted money meant for the development basic education. We were blacklisted. When he was leading Kwara, workers at the Colleges of Education were being owed 30 months in salary arrears. The schools had all lost accreditation. In fact, the norm in those days was for your relatives in the civil service to beg you for money because they were not being paid. They were still owing workers even when they got bailouts from the Federal Government. Things were really bad. Everything has collapsed under them. People had lost hope. We no longer have half salary as we had it under his reign. We have breathed life back to Kwara. I believe Senator Saraki was just playing to the gallery on the national Tv. In fact, the people will respond to his comment that they were gullible and unreasonable to vote him out. He will get his response at the right time.\n\nYour name came up in a recent interview by the governor and in the reply of the minister. The minister said he funded the whole election and all of you beneficiaries of his sweat have been ungrateful to him. What exactly is happening?\n\nSee, I have been with the Governor since 2010 as one of his foot soldiers. He has always been a front runner in the struggle of kwara people to end the political slavery. He had always been at the trenches. As for the claims of Alhaji Lai Mohammed over election funding, I make bold to say here that Alhaji Lai did not fund my election. I think I can speak for 21 other members of the Hobourable House and our senators. I am aware that the Governor not only funded his own campaign, he spent his personal fortunes to support other candidates. Alhaji was nowhere to be found. We went to the farthest places in Kwara North during the campaign with the Governor. Where was Alhaji Lai at that time? He was not a factor in our election as such. It is better to just ignore those outrageous claims because everyone knows them to be pure lies. How can somebody that we didn\u2019t see before, during and after election claim to fund the same election?\n\nHow would you describe the developments in the Kwara APC?\n\nFor me, there is more noise than substance in the noise about so-called crisis. Some lousy minorities are the ones making so much noise because they want to be recognised. They are using all sort of blackmail just to portray crisis. I will urge such persons to join hands with the Governor and other sincere stakeholders to build the party to a greater height. For me, what I see is sheer blackmail and red herring to seek undeserved attention. I\u2019m sure the National secretariat of the party has seen through the gimmick during the party registration. There is really nothing to fret about. All you hear are mostly contrived noise to seek attention.\n\nDo you see all the warring parties coming together again?\n\nAbsolutely. Especially for those who seek development of the state and not selfish gains. Whatever our differences, which is normal in any human environment, we are stronger together if all we seek is development. Democracy itself encourages debate and I must commend the Governor for his statesmanship and patience despite provocations. He has really done well to tolerate a lot of excesses. We know what happened elsewhere. He has been very accommodating, in spite of obvious disrespect to his person and office. He is what a good leader should be.\n\nWhat are the chances of your party in 2023, given the infighting , the Saraki factor, and of course some defections that may happen?\n\nWhatever our differences, which I believe will be resolved in favour of party discipline and accommodation, the chances of our party are very bright. We have nothing to fret over. As for the former Minister, he is just pursuing his personal gains. His defection has nothing to do with the collective good of our local government, Kwara North, or the state. Apart from the unprecedented level of development we have seen in our region, the Minister is one of the direct beneficiaries of this administration because his daughter is a leading light of this government. Yes it is often said that the more the merrier in a democracy, but I do not fret whatsoever over his defection as the entire Kwara North and especially Baruten where I come from remain solidly behind the APC and of course the administration of the Governor who has really done well.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Director-General of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Moh Lukman, has said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) deserves commendation for conducting a successful national convention last weekend.\n\nLukman, however, claimed, in the statement that it was possible because the party is in opposition. He said apart from consolidating on the successful composition of a new national leadership, the party should avoid culture of arrogance and impunity.\n\n\u201cWith the successful conclusion of the PDP national convention, credit must be given to leaders and members of the party for being able to manage the process and elect a new leadership for the party,\u201d he wrote in the statement.\n\n\u201cThose who are not members of the party should urge the newly elected PDP leaders to build on the new atmosphere to start a new beginning for the party based on honesty, respect for one another and above all recognising that politics is all about negotiations and agreement.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cEvery negotiation should produce agreement based on majority decisions. Of course, people are free to disagree with decisions of the majority. But such disagreements should respect the rights of the majority to direct how parties, society and nation should be governed.\n\n\u201cWhen disagreement turn to rebellion, it is either that those who disagree are not democrats, or they lack the capacity to negotiate and through negotiations win support of majority, or they are very desperate to have their says and ways in dictating how organisations and wider Nigerian society should be governed. It may also be a combination of all the above.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the successful conclusion of the PDP National Convention should only be celebrated by PDP members. However, given the important role the party has played in orienting politics in Nigeria for 16 years between 1999 and 2015, during which Nigerian politics was made to be opposed to negotiations, it is important to acknowledge that the Convention is about the first time, since 1999 perhaps, that there is some semblance of negotiations to produce leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cWhether in the end, the new leaders will be allowed by the power blocs within the PDP to facilitate negotiations, is completely a different matter. By the way, the fact that the party can elect a young person, below 30 years as National Youth Leader means that PDP leaders have recognised that the old culture of arrogance and impunity must be avoided if they are to win the support of Nigerians, which is very positive.\n\n\u201cThis is itself a confirmation that once processes are managed democratically; the right results would be achieved. Every Nigerian should wish PDP, its leaders and party members well.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

But the two organisations have denied their involvement following public outrage.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe IGP, in a statement by Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, said those found to have taken part in the operation would be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nMba said details would be made public on conclusion of investigations.\n\nMeanwhile, Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the South East South South Professionals of Nigeria (SESSPN) have condemned the raid and called for prosecution of the perpetrators.\n\nThe governor described the raid as ill-advised and an attempt to intimidate the judiciary, which is an independent arm of government.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government, which controls the security agencies, not to only investigate the incident, but also ensure that those found culpable are brought to book and properly sanctioned.\n\nHe said the world was watching to see how the Federal Government handled the incident, which according to him, was another ugly episode and one too many on the attacks by security operatives on the homes of judicial officers in the country.\n\nNHRC also called for the prosecution of those behind what it called unlawful invasion.\n\nIts executive secretary, Tony Ojukwu, in a statement by Fatimah Mohammed, deputy director, Public Affairs described the raid at Odili\u2019s house as violation of her rights to privacy, integrity of her judicial personality, premises and office.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators must, therefore, be made to account for their professional misconduct by arresting them, prosecuting them,\u201d he said.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, in a statement by Alex Ogbonnia said it was ethically reprehensible and globally unacceptable for the executive to invade the home of a senior member of the judicial arm of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is simply a mockery on democracy and a foul miasma on the image of Nigeria. The siege on her home is an assault on several institutions; womanhood, judiciary, democracy, rule of law, civil society and indeed all facets of humanity.\n\n\u201cJustice Mary Odili is one of the few judges in Nigeria with clean and intimidating credentials. All the schools she attended still post her brilliant performances.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo, therefore, demands that an unreserved apology should be rendered to the highly revered Justice of the Supreme Court; and an assurance that such an embarrassment will never be contemplated.\u201d\n\nADF alleged that the desecration of the judiciary by the Federal Government was part of a tendentious plan and another brutal strategy employed by President Muhammadu Buhari administration\u2019s top brass to navigate the impending politics of transition in the country\u2019s highest court.\n\nChairman of ADF\u2019s Media and Publicity Bureau, Abia Onyike claimed Odili was targetted because she is the next in rank to the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad.\n\n\u201cThey want to block her from succeeding the incumbent. That was the same crude method used to deal ruthlessly with Justice Walter Onoghen. We in ADF condemn the destruction and destitution of the judiciary by executive lawlessness. This devilish anti-democratic machination must be halted forthwith,\u201d Onyike stated.\n\nIn its reaction, SESSPN described the invasion as a new low of deliberate rascality, too sordid for rational comprehension.\n\n\u201cFor a nation that wakes up to daily servings of state impunity, this is another grave sacrilege beyond ineptitude, and one we hoped won\u2019t be our lot again, after a 2016 similar castration of Supreme Court Justices,\u201d its publicity secretary, Collins Ugwu said.\n\nAlso, National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) has demanded full scale inquiry to unravel the circumstances surrounding the raid on the residence of Odili.\n\nA statement by Abiola Owoaje, said such inquisition should begin with Chief Magistrate Emmanuel Iyanna, whistle blower, Aliyu Umar and Lawrence Ajodo.\n\n\u201cUntil a justifiable explanation is offered for this abject manifestation of autocratic recklessness, the wretchedness of this disposition must be roundly and comprehensively deprecated. It is an abhorrent disregard for the rule of law; a condemnable and totally unacceptable affront on this country\u2019s increasingly fragile democratic structures, and a gross violation of the fundamental human rights of Justice Peter-Odili,\u201d Owoaje said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

This is never done and never accepted. The world is watching us. So, we appeal to the House Committee on Aviation and Senate Committee to back off from the decisions taken by NCAA with respect to the industry. Rather, all they can do is to advise or raise a resolution and pass it across to the regulator or ask other industry players to speak on such issues instead of interfering directly on such issues.\n\n\u201cPolitical interference will make us lose face in the comity of nations, principally with the regulator.

          "text": "As the world marks the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against journalists today, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has called on governments, at all levels, to make deliberate and sustained efforts to promote a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their work freely.\n\nThe editors also reminded the government that attacks on journalists have destructive effect on dissemination of information and helpful debate in a democratic space. They expressed concern over the way journalists are increasingly subjected to all forms of threats, including kidnapping, torture, physical attacks and other forms of harassments.\n\nIn a statement, yesterday, by NGE\u2019s President, Mustapha Isah, and the General Secretary, Iyobosa Uuwgiaren, the professional group also called on the security agencies to immediately locate a missing a journalist, Tordue Salem; investigate all forms of attacks against journalists \u2013 with the sole purpose of prosecuting the offenders.\n\nSalem, a journalist with Vanguard Newspapers, who covers the House of Representatives, has been declared missing in the past few weeks.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly had proclaimed every November 2 as the \u201cInternational Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists\u2019\u2019 in General Assembly Resolution A/RES/68/163. The resolution urges member states to implement definite measures countering the present culture of impunity.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThis milestone resolution condemns all attacks and violence against journalists and media workers. And also urges member states to do their utmost to prevent violence against journalists and media workers, to ensure accountability, bring to justice perpetrators of crimes against journalists and media workers, and ensure victims have access to appropriate remedies.\n\nWhile expressing worry over refusal by the appropriate authorities to properly investigate threats of violence and attacks against journalists in the past few years, the NGE said it is very troubling for an adult like Salem to just vanish into thin air for the past three weeks without a trace.\n\nChronicling instances of attacks against journalists in the past two years, the Guild said on October 11, last year, Gimba Kakanda, a columnist with Daily Trust newspaper, was attacked by police officers, when he tried to pick up his car near the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development in Abuja.\n\nAlso on October 11, 2020, the police violently attacked Arise Television cameraman, Francis Ogbonna, and a reporter, Ferdinand Duruoha, while they were covering protests in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe also have on record how some unknown gunmen \u2013 on October 12, 2020, attacked Television Continental presenter, Theophilus Elamah, in the chest and forced him and the cameraman he was working with, Julius Idowu, to leave the protest area.\n\n\u2018\u2019On October 17, 2020, Oluwatoyin Yusuf, a reporter with the Osun State Broadcasting Corporation, was attacked by unidentified men while covering a protest in Oshogbo, the state capital.\n\n\u2018\u2019Also on October 21, 2020 in Lagos, unknown men attacked the offices of Lagos State Television and the TVC broadcaster.\n\n\u201cWhile covering the October 21 attack on TVC, Ayo Makinde, a reporter with the privately owned Channels Television broadcaster was assaulted by unidentified people,\u2019\u2019 the Guild said.\n\nThe NGE reminded politicians, government officials and security agents that while they like to present their success stories and their opinions, using the media to gain public respect and widen their authority; the media\u2019s role is to question them critically, and hold them accountable to the people.\n\n\u201cIf journalists are to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities earnestly and robustly, politicians, government officials and security agents must treat them respectfully. They must ensure regular flow of information and frank dispassionate approach in dealing with journalists,\u2019\u2019 the editors said.\n\nAside from deadly attacks, the NGE said it has also noticed \u201canti-media rhetoric\u2019\u2019 by some politicians and senior government officials \u2013 that is hostile to the media.\n\nAccording to the NGE, \u201cThis anti-media rhetoric has lent a hand to a sense of resentment against journalists, and contributed hugely to questioning of trust in the media, and creating a susceptible working atmosphere for journalists and media workers.\n\n\u201cWe have also noticed that some members of the National Assembly are using prerogatives of so-called \u2018fake news\u2019 as a doubtful justification to propose amendments to media laws \u2013 with intention to criminalise journalism practice in Nigeria, curtail freedom of expression, suffocate democratic space and muzzle journalists in particular.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe editors reiterated that the media is neither a political rival nor opponent of the government; but an institution recognises by Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution to, at all times, hold public officials accountable to the people and promotes good governance.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Says people thought convention would break up party\n\n*Dares APC to conduct own convention\n\n*Ekweremadu congratulates new officials\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha\n\nThe newly affirmed National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has said the mission of the party under his leadership was to rescue the nation from the current mess, occasioned by the misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government since 2015.\n\nAyu, who spoke early Sunday morning also appreciated the PDP delegates and the party\u2019s governors for conducting a smooth and peaceful national convention\n\nHe however, dared the APC to conduct its national convention from the over 90 states factional chairmen, while stating that some members of the party thought that the PDP would break up as the aftermath of the convention.\n\nThis is as a former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has congratulated Ayu, and other 20 national officers-elect, who emerged at the just concluded national convention of the party.\n\nIn his appreciation speech after 3,426 delegates affirmed his election as the chairman, Ayu said, \u201cI want to sincerely appreciate the PDP family. Today is simply a thank you address. When we started this party 23 years ago, we never in any way imagined that the journey will get us to this stage.\n\n\u201cA stage, where we ruled for 16 years, we went into rough times, but for anybody, who bothered to see, PDP is back. PDP is back to rescue Nigeria from the terrible mess we have been in, in the last six years. I want to appreciate all of you, who have taken time as delegates, as observers, as supporters, as members of the media, as members of the security services, who have made this event wonderful.\n\n\u201cMany people imagined that this convention will lead to the break-up of the PDP. Those people, who are dreaming like that, they were dreaming in wonderland. Their dreaming were misplaced.\n\n\u201cThose, who have lost hope should know that Nigeria is not a divided country. A small group of people decided to divide Nigeria. PDP will come back to unite our people, put them together, North and South, East and West.\n\n\u201cWe will move ahead to develop this country. We did it before. We are going to do it again. I want to thank the governors. I want to thank the delegates. I want to thank our supporters and every single person, who has made this event such a huge success.\n\n\u201cI believe the other party can never hold a convention, because even state congress, they cannot hold. They have produced 92 state chairmen for 36 states, how can they hold a successful convention, which the PDP has done? We are waiting for them. This is a challenge to them. Let them come on pole searches, successful on ledger with what the PDP has done. This is a quit notice. PDP is back and is taking back the country to develop it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PDP elected a new set of members into its National Working Committee (NWC) to take over its leadership.\n\nTwenty-one people were elected at its national convention, which began on Saturday, October 30, and lasted till Sunday, October 31, at the Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nAyu was declared national chairman after 3,426 delegates affirmed his unopposed position. The outcome of the election was announced in the early hours of yesterday.\n\nIn the same manner, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, from Southeast emerged the National Secretary of the party unopposed.\n\nTHISDAY had earlier reported that 18 out of the 21 National Working Committee (NWC) offices were unopposed.\n\nThe office of the Deputy National Chairman (South), was keenly contested and Amb. Taofeek Arapaja, was declared winner after polling 2,004 votes at the party\u2019s convention.\n\nHis closest contender, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, garnered 705 votes.\n\nThe position of the National Youth Leader, was won by Mohammed Kadade Sulieman with 3,072 against his closest rival, Usman ElKudan, who polled 219, while the Deputy National Chairman (North), was clinched by Umar Iliya Damagum, who polled 2,222 to defeat former Minister of Women Affairs, Hajia Maryam Ina Ciroma, who polled 365.\n\nChairman of the Convention Planning Committee and Chairman, Electoral Sub-Committee of the convention, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State, announced the results and commended party faithful for what he described as a successful convention.\n\nOther elected officers through the party\u2019s unopposed contest that scored 3,426 votes were Ahmed Yayari Mohammed as national treasurer and Kamaldeen Adeyemi Ajibade, the national legal adviser.\n\nUmar Bature is the new national organising secretary, Daniel Woyegikuro emerged national financial secretary, Stella Effah-Attoe is the new national woman leader and Okechukwu Obiechina Daniel, national auditor.\n\nSetonji Koshoede is the new deputy national secretary, Ndubisi Eneh David, deputy national treasurer, Ibrahim Abdullahi is the deputy national publicity secretary, Ighoyota Amori, deputy national organising secretary, Adamu Kamale, deputy national financial secretary, Hajaja Yakubu Wanka, deputy national woman leader, Timothy Osadolor, deputy national youth leader and Okechukwu Osuoha, deputy national legal adviser.\n\nFull List of New PDP National Officials:\n\nNational Chairman \u2013 Iyorchia Ayu\n\nDeputy National Chairman (North) \u2013 Umar Damagum (Contested)\n\nDeputy National Chairman (South) \u2013 Taofeek Arapaja (Contested)\n\nNational Secretary \u2013 Samuel Anyanwu (Unopposed)\n\nNational Treasurer \u2013 Ahmed Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nNational Organising Secretary \u2013 Umar Bature (Unopposed)\n\nNational Financial Secretary \u2013 Daniel Woyegikuro (Unopposed)\n\nNational Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Professor Stella Effah-Attoe (Unopposed)\n\nNational Youth Leader \u2013 Muhammed Suleiman (Contested)\n\nNational Legal Adviser \u2013 Kamaldeen Ajibade (Unopposed)\n\nNational Publicity Secretary \u2013 Debo Ologunagba (Unopposed)\n\nNational Auditor \u2013 Okechuckwu Daniel (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Secretary \u2013 Setoji Kosheodo (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Treasurer \u2013 Ndubisi David (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Publicity Secretary \u2013 Ibrahim Abdullahi (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Organising Secretary \u2013 Ighoyota Amori (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Financial Secretary \u2013 Adamu Kamale (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Hajara Wanka (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Youth Leader \u2013 Timothy Osadolor (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Legal Adviser \u2013 Okechukwu Osuoha (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Auditor \u2013 Abdulrahman Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nMeanwhile, Ekweremadu, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Uche Anichukwu, in Abuja on Sunday, said the emergence of Ayu and other national officers would give the PDP the much-needed renewed vigour and focus required to rescue Nigeria.\n\nThe ranking Senator also commended the Elder Yemi Akinnwonmi-led leadership of the party and the Governor Ahmadu Fintiri-led National Convention Planning Committee for seamless and transparent elections, saying the PDP has disappointed her evil wishers.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is hearty congratulations to the newly elected national officers of our great party, the PDP. Given the pedigree and antecedents of our National Chairman-elect and his team, I have no doubt that we got it right.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in dire need of rescue from the clutches of divisiveness, criminal cartels, vaunting bandits and insurgents, collapsing economy (to put it mildly), and secessionist agitations occasioned by injustice and marginalisation.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that we have in place a highly promising team led by a widely-accepted, disciplined, experienced, and pan-Nigerian politician in the person of Distinguished Senator Iyorchia Ayu, that will help mobilise party faithful and Nigerians at home and the diaspora for the success of this mission\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rotimi Amaechi: Our 2019 Experience Won\u2019t Happen Again in Rivers",
          "text": "The Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s disposition to any media engagement is nothing short of an opportunity to relax and unwind, even when the issues involved are serious. With candour and humour, he always waltzes through, no matter the stretch of time. Yet, Amaechi is not one of those sources, who would ask to have your questions in advance or an idea of the areas you intend to cover, although nothing is bad in being prepared for an interview. Just \u2018come and shoot\u2019, whilst he plays through the session, curiously, dealing with some of the most difficult questions arising from his beat. Interestingly, his familiar approach to what might have been considered obnoxious issues, took a different form this time, making the time spent with THISDAY a lot more interactive. From the business of railway infrastructure development in the country to concerns in the maritime sector, the local politics of Rivers State, the clamour for power shift, the man called Muhammadu Buhari and the journey to the 2023 presidential bout, the former governor of Rivers State, had his answers structured for every probing question, somewhat. Excerpts:\n\nFor nearly 6 years, you\u2019ve been the minister of transportation and the major focus has been mainly railway infrastructure. How has the journey been like?\n\nThe journey has been tough; it has not been easy, honestly. There is somebody that I am battling with now or a group of people that I am battling with. They are trying to blackmail me, they want me to give them a contract and they have come to me physically and I said no. Now that the contract is in the process of approval, they have sent some text messages to me. Let me just show you the message they sent to me so that you can see how bad they are, but me, I will never fall for blackmail.\n\nListen to what they sent to me: \u201cWe are working on a cargo-tracking note story and we need the minister\u2019s reply to some questions below. The VP says the minister has contravened the public procurement act in obtaining the presidential approval for the contract.\u201d How do you contravene a public procurement act when you have a presidential approval? Don\u2019t forget I said they had approached me physically. When they could not reach me, they got to my wife. And so, for not giving them, they now contracted a press team and I say they can publish. At least, I have got approval from the president.\n\nThree times they tried to stop it, they got some government officials to stop it \u2013 three times \u2013 but I still continued. Having failed in the last one, which happened two weeks ago, they have now contracted a press team. So those are the things you meet in the course of your work as a minister of transport. It has not been easy. If anybody thinks it is easy, it is not, coupled with the fact that there is a political element to the issue of railway construction. And I told a joke, I said see the Yoruba, they are not complaining, no shouting, nothing because we have done Lagos-Ibadan. If we had not done Lagos-Ibadan, the Yoruba would have been shouting by now.\n\nSo that is the political element to it. It is just like the Igbo are saying, oh, you have done nothing for our side. They merit having a railway but I have always said that railway construction is not political; it is economics. I am constructing Lagos-Ibadan, not because I want to satisfy the Yoruba, it is because Lagos-Kano will generate about 11 million tons of cargo. So in the whole of the country, that figure by far makes economic sense for anybody who wants to construct a railway than going to construct, for instance, from South-south. If the South-south is about 3 million or 4 million tons, I will first and foremost construct Lagos to Kano, because it makes more economic sense than doing the one where I come from.\n\nSo we are pursuing Lagos to Kano, and as we are talking now, we are constructing from Kano to Kaduna. We have finished Lagos to Ibadan, we are looking for money to go from Ibadan to Abuja to complete the whole gamut of Lagos to Kano. Now, the next most important rail line to Lagos \u2013Kano is Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, which includes the South East area, because it has 11 million tons of cargo. We have not been able to generate the data for Lagos to Calabar. The president has said to me, Ameachi, complete Lagos to Kano, Port Harcourt to Maiduguri and then Lagos to Calabar. These are the three most important rail lines in Nigeria. The next one will be the central line, which is Itakpe to Warri but then, there is a new addition, which comes from Abuja to Barro to Itakpe. That is the central line. Once we finish this, the areas that will be remaining will be Yola, Adamawa, Taraba, Gusau in Zamfara, Sokoto and Kebbi. These are the five states that are remaining and we are working towards it. They are not contiguous and that is why we are finding it difficult. The professionals are doing their feasibility studies so that we can add them.\n\nYou have the numbers for Lagos to Kano, the volume it carries, 11 million tons, what is the economic data that supports the construction of Kano to Maradi rail?\n\nI have answered that question to the whole country. I have answered it outside Nigeria. I have also answered my wife and children. We did not design Kano-Maradi; it was not our idea. We met it on the table. Somebody told me that it was Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government that did the feasibility studies and design and all that, I don\u2019t know how true it is. Two, it is a critical arrangement between Nigeria and ECOWAS. So Nigeria is bound to do two major rail lines to join the West African rail line, that is, Lagos to Seme and Kano to Maradi. And for me, Kano to Maradi makes more economic sense than Lagos to Seme. Maradi makes more economic sense than Seme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget Benin Republic is a competing nation. They are competing with Nigeria, because they are a coastal state; they have a seaport. What ECOWAS is trying to do is to bring landlocked states to be able to use their waters. So you shouldn\u2019t be encouraging your neighbouring state that has waters. What you should do is to see how you can make sure it does not have enough cargo. If you want to do that, then, Kano rail becomes a priority. I now said okay, Nigeria will fulfil its obligation by constructing Kano to Maradi. I flew to Niger Republic, had a meeting with the prime minister and said to him, \u2018look, we are going to construct rail line from Kano to Maradi and we are already constructing Lagos to Kano, which means that, if you board in Maradi, you will not stop anywhere until you get to Lagos. What is the benefit? The seaport in Lagos becomes busier than it is now, because they have promised us and we should put that in writing. I am not a lawyer; I have to imbibe that culture of putting things in writing. I usually believe that everybody is a gentleman but these are nations \u2013 Nigerian nation and Niger Republic. There is a need for us to put it in writing. They have agreed that their country will import national cargos through Lagos seaport. That is the way to make money out of the Kano-Maradi rail line.\n\nBut how do you action that in an international court, assuming they reneged on the agreement?\n\nHow did you action Bakassi? An agreement is an agreement. I am a law student; I am a fourth-year law student. I am doing a double degree in law. I am doing LLB Law at Base University, LLB law at the University of London. I have done contracts here and there, and contract means if you and I reached an agreement, in any form \u2013 whether oral or written \u2013you are bound to keep to that agreement. Any breach of it, I will go to court. There are so many international agreements in the world. Like this one I told you now, why are we doing Kano to Maradi? Because there is an agreement between all the West African states that each person will do its own.\n\nYet, the president said on national television that he was doing the rail to Maradi because his cousins were there?\n\nHe was joking. You know how our elders saw Nigeria; they saw Nigeria as a big brother to everybody. Unlike now because of poverty, we the younger ones are saying no, no, our leaders keep that your concept of Nigeria being big brother. So our president is still seeing Nigeria as a big brother to everybody. It is not the nature of the president to explain to you, which I have done now. I go to the cabinet and they ask me questions, some people attack me and I defend it. The approval by the cabinet was not done by the president alone, it was done by all of us. So when the president tells you they are our cousins, he was trying to make you remember that all of us are one. If somebody from Niger walks in here now and doesn\u2019t open his mouth, will you know? Just like if a Cross River person walks in here, you won\u2019t know; you will think he is a Rivers man until our intonations come to play.\n\nA lot of people thought or believed that the president must have influenced that particular contract.\n\nOh\u2026 no no no, it is so annoying when I hear statements like that. Do you know why I said that? I wrote to the President four years ago, he refused to approve for a different reason. His argument was that, I am the president of the country, if you take the rail to pass through Daura, it will look as if I influenced it. And I made a joke to him. I said, \u2018Oga don\u2019t worry, when we get to the boundary between Daura and there, we will jump to Katsina and leave Daura alone.\n\nThe Maritime University in Daura, or is it Transport University? Some people described it as another northern agenda. What informed locating in a place like Daura?\n\nThere is no maritime university in Daura. That is where they say my arrogance comes in. What is in Daura is Transport University. The Maritime University is in Okorokiko in Delta. What you have in Daura is Transport University and the federal government or you and I are paying no kobo. I usually brag about it and say, I could have taken that money, get CCECC $50 million to go and invest in Duara and build a university for us. Why? Because you can build all these railway tracks and all that but the day the Chinese go, you don\u2019t have any technology to manage it. We had a battle. They agreed, just like I had a battle, that they should build one in my village. By the way, they are building one in my village and it is called federal university.\n\nMuch as Nigerians love the feats in the railway sector, there had been concerns about endless borrowings to fund it. Do you think the worries are misplaced?\n\nAgain, that is where you people accuse me of arrogance. What is the evidence about borrowing? So far, we have only borrowed $1.4 billion in my ministry, which is for Lagos to Ibadan. If you do your investigations, Lagos to Ibadan is $2 billion, the federal government is putting $600 million and we have put in $600 million even though we still owe less than $100 or $200 million. Now, we borrowed $1.4 billion \u2013 that\u2019s what we borrowed.\n\nUnder President Goodluck Jonathan, they borrowed $500 million to do Abuja-Kaduna. So Abuja-Kaduna which is $1billion, the Chinese government gave us $500 million. If you add the two, it is $2.1 billion since Goodluck Jonathan. Kano-Maradi is $1.9 billion, we have not borrowed, yes, we have seen the money for Kano-Maradi but until we sign the agreement, we have not borrowed. We have not seen the money for Ibadan to Abuja, the Chinese are no longer giving the money they wanted, so we are looking for the money. We are looking for money for Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, which is $3.020 billion. We have not borrowed.\n\nWhen we go to the National Assembly, it is to get the approval, which is the requirement to get a loan, because your parliament must agree that you can borrow. For Kano-Kaduna, up till now, we are funded about $300 million dollars from the budget. As I am talking today, they are constructing Kano-Kaduna. The only place you can say we borrowed will be Lagos-Ibadan, $1.6billion; Abuja-Kaduna, $500 million and we don\u2019t have money yet. So when people say we are borrowing money, I am tired of explaining. Let me give you an example. I go to the cabinet and say, I want to do Port Harcourt-Maiduguri, $3.020 billion, people will shout\u2026Amaechi! They will exclaim.\n\nBut they have forgotten that all we have got was an approval to find the money. As I am talking to you now, I am scouting around the world to look for $3.020 billion. I am looking for money to do Lagos-Calabar, which covers my area, South-south; it is not there, $11.1 billion. We have seen some movement of cash; they have told us that they will give us $300 million to start while we look for $1.65 billion. Supposing we finished the $300 million and they say they don\u2019t have money, what will you do? But so far, they have not given us any money, which is why I said I have seen, because once you put pen to paper, they will raise the first $300 million for us to commence construction.\n\nCentral line is even the worst, the Chinese company said they want to do PPP, we signed and got the contract for them to sign, now they said no, we should convert it to contract. I said no, I will not. Instead of me to convert it to contract, I will cancel it. We will advertise it and I won\u2019t let you bid. You misled us. When you are asking for PPP, everybody I met in the world told me there is nowhere since the world was created that they have seen PPP in railway. And they said there could always be a first time. Now, they have gone to look for the money and can\u2019t find the money. They say we should convert to a contract, but I will not and I will go back to the cabinet to ask for cancellation. So all these things you are hearing \u2013 all of them put together \u2013 is about $36 billion dollars. We have not got more than $2 billion.\n\nThe ones you have borrowed, are they repayable, I mean can it repay the loan?\n\nWe are already paying. We have paid over $100 million for Abuja-Kaduna. And to contribute to the payment, the ministry of transport has said to the ministry of finance, once you remove the operational cost for the rail lines, take the rest. And operational cost is about a 100-and-something million naira and we are making N350 million now.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem of model, because the Lagos-Lekki expressway is a toll road. So what are you doing to your rails?\n\nIs there anywhere they toll rail? There is nowhere they toll rail. In fact, if railways are tolled, rail will be the cheapest means of transportation. We are here subsidising rail. You have to understand that rail is not only for passengers, it is also for cargos. So what you should say is that why is Nigeria not producing? We don\u2019t produce anything. A man met me and said we don\u2019t have rail in my town and I said tell me what you want me to do. If I bring rail to your town, what will it be carrying? Absolutely nothing. The only reason I encouraged the president to continue the rail construction is this, at the end of the day, when Nigerians begin to produce, they won\u2019t tell us they had logistical problems, because what train is about, is logistics. But here, what are you moving? There are no metals or iron ore, not even chicken. We have the capacity to move fuel, diesel. If you are going to Ibadan, once you reach Kajola, look to the left, you will see our wet cargo wagons.\n\nWe have wagons that can carry frozen cargos. They are all there, we bought them. But unfortunately, we are not producing. I thank God for making me a minister. I used to come across people of affluence, and when the president said we want a new shipping line according to the law. What does the law say? The law says that Nigerians will hold 60% shares and foreigners will hold 40% shares. I was very enthusiastic as a young man who wants to get everything done. I boarded a plane to Singapore, and we got a Singaporean company that says they will bring the 40%. Till today, no Nigerian has raised one kobo.\n\nTalking about rail, you once said the solution lies in rail. Now, you have been a minister for about 6 years, and not much has changed, would you say you have failed on Apapa?\n\nHow can I say that? The crisis in Apapa is not ours. Why I said the solution lies on the rail is that the moment you take the rail to the key side, any cargo that comes in just stops on the rail. Why have we not done that? Two things are affecting us. The first one is that, in the course of construction, there was a place that they used to dump waste. We thought by engineering this, we had found a solution to it, so we laid the tracks and passed. Few months after, depression started, the engineers called our attention to it. The consulting supervising company, the Chinese company, all of them came and said no, we need to find the technology to deal with it. Further investigation showed that it was 10 meters deep. The Chinese have reviewed that, to excavate the 10 meters and do soil replacement.\n\nThe Italians, who are the supervising engineers, said no, that it requires bridging. That is what I approved two weeks ago. Now, we have given the Chinese the directive to do that, so that there will be no further depression. They told us it will be done in six months. What they agreed with us was that by December, they would have finished work there. But that was because the Chinese thought it was soil replacement. So if I had approved soil replacement, it would have taken them one month to excavate the 10 meters and get soil somewhere else, maybe in Ogun or anywhere to replace it. But the other company felt that a more permanent solution would be a bridging facility, which I have approved.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer it will take them. When they finish that, there is another problem in front, near the key. The custom building that has scanners, and scanners come with dangerous chemicals. So we get a company from outside the country to come and take it away. That will take us some few months. The president has already approved cargos that can go on road transportation. Once we finish that, we will now compel those people who do not meet the requirements for road transportation to use the railway facility up to Ibadan. I have told the governor of Oyo State to prepare once we start this. I would have done him one good thing, our last station is outside Ibadan. So do a road that links that station to the express so that nobody comes into Ibadan because if they come into Ibadan, they will clog Ibadan. But if you do that road to the express, anybody who is coming will just drive from there, pack at our station, pick up his cargo and leave.\n\nAre you likely running this rail infrastructure at a loss presently?\n\nThere is nowhere in the world that they make profit in railways, except, probably China. But it is very small. So yes. When it comes to Abuja-Kaduna, we have moved from N70 million profit per month to N350 million. If you look at the cost of construction, you must deduct it from it to know whether you are making a loss, because no rail line has been able to pay for itself. So if you say, I want to pay for this rail line, and you make N350 million per month, multiply it by 12, that means our grandchildren will pay what we are paying. But if I see it from the other way of being a politician, I can say yes, I am making N350 million per month in Abuja-Kaduna, I am not making that much in Lagos, yet, because we are yet to introduce the number of rail.\n\nBy December, we\u2019ll introduce 16 trains per day, 8 going and 8 coming and each will contain 14 couches. So I should be able to make money also in Lagos-Ibadan. Where we may not make money is Warri-Itakpe. The reason we may not make money on Warri-Itakpe is because first, there are no passengers, because it\u2019s not meant for passengers. It\u2019s for iron ore and cargo.\n\nTalking about making money, there are allegations of ticket racketeering.\n\nIf at all there is, maybe Lagos, because we have cleaned that out in Abuja-Kaduna when we introduced e-ticketing. Let me let you know, I am under the same pressure for this electronic ticketing in Lagos. So in Lagos, it may be possible if at all there is ticket racketeering. But it is not as pronounced as it was in Abuja-Kaduna. In Abuja-Kaduna, we arrested the guy and took him to court. And he had a good case. He said look, I am a Nigerian and a businessman. I buy tickets and resell, what is wrong with that? He said, he comes early in the morning, buys ticket, say 20 at N1000 and resells for N2000, what is your business? But he lost the case.\n\nThe issue of safety and security in the railway business. How are you handling that especially, in the light of the recent bombing of the Kaduna rail tracks?\n\nYou know when people asked me before, I was saying it was not bombing. But the security information I got this morning indicated that it was an IED. So whoever gave them that sense to put nitrate, ammonia and every other thing, to put on the track, then, we need to be more careful than we have been. The first thing is that we are going to talk with the Air Force again. Before, the air force used to fly above all our routes, so they see whoever is on the track at any time. But I think at a time they stopped, maybe because of the cost of doing that. So we need to re-introduce that.\n\nThe next thing we need to introduce is the rail bus. We have a rail bus that runs on the track. If a train is coming, it can just veer off, so when the train is gone it comes back. The third and final one is that we are going back to cabinet to get approval for a digitalised security system. What that digital system does is that if you touch the track, it triggers wherever we are. So you know who is on the track and you see the track end-to-end and you are able to make decisions. It doesn\u2019t stop people from walking on the track but we are seeing it and we know what they are doing. If we had installed it, you would have seen the gentleman who dropped that IED on the track.\n\nAre you likely to be able to recoup these investments?\n\nAs I said, in railways, you cannot recoup. It is just what you need to grow your economy. Take for instance, what impact that act would have had on people who live between Abuja and Kaduna? Most people who could not afford to pay house rent in Abuja are now living in Kaduna and coming to work at 6am. They arrive here at 8am and go to work. So you are looking at how much the person has saved. Now, what happens to the economy of Kaduna? Landlords will make more money because they now have tenants. The micro economy of Kaduna will grow. You cannot see railways put money in your hand, it just grows an economy. And that is what we have done so far. But the greatest economy the rail will grow is the productive economy.\n\nYour government has been in power for almost 7 years and one of the issues has been Nigeria being a consumption economy. What is really being done to make the country productive?\n\nYou would think I am a sycophant when I say you should praise the president. And why did I say you should praise the president? I visited Borno when we campaigned for Dr Peter Odili and I saw that watermelon was growing in the wild, not planted. If you go to Borno and plant watermelon on 100,000 hectares of land, imagine how many people you will employ. Imagine whether Boko Haram will survive. The reason people will enroll in Boko Haram is just hunger, it is not religion. Hunger which is driven by poverty and a lack of education. So if I were the governor of Bornu State, I would focus on education and how to reduce poverty. Why do people join Boko Haram? Hopelessness! Don\u2019t forget the reason Nigeria could move and progress in the past was because we had hope. Nigeria used to believe that once an administration comes, in four years\u2019 time, they will go.\n\nAnother administration comes and repeats what the last one did. They will be hoping that the next one will be better. But now it is so hopeless that they don\u2019t even believe that anyone and anything will change. So we\u2019ve lost hope and because Nigerians have lost hope, they are taking the laws into their hands since there is nothing to live for. The reason you can see a man commit suicide is because there is nothing to live for. Now, if Boko Haram calls you and say, take 5, 000 naira and go and bomb this man, it is because if he doesn\u2019t take it, nothing will change. So we need to give hope and how is the Buhari government giving hope? Have you looked at our contribution in Agriculture? In a rural economy like the Nigerian economy, if we can\u2019t manufacture, then, you can do agric production.\n\nI remember before I became speaker in Rivers State, everybody was going to look for work and they had other sectors of the economy. We were producing cream and all other things, the value chain was there. It was in my regime but I now sold it to a Belgian. The general manager who actually built it was ashamed that he handed over the thing, because Nigerians don\u2019t produce. They don\u2019t care. They want money to just feed; they don\u2019t even ask how the money comes. If you are not getting the money, they say you are a thief but when you share the money with them, that is when you are a good man.\n\nBut a report by AFEXT, a commodity trading exchange, claimed that production has been poor because of insecurity.\n\nI agree. Where is the incentive? We are not here for only two years, it is not something that started happening two years ago, we\u2019ve been here six years. Before, we used to import chicken. I am into poultry farming. You know Obasanjo started as a poultry farmer. He could not get the licence to buy GPS and he knew only one person had that licence. Now, a few people bought the parent stock from that licence, because you won\u2019t import. And that person did not have the capacity to produce the parent stock for us to buy, so chicken was being imported. Yar\u2019Adua (former president Umar) came and expanded it to 15 persons. I was one of the 15 people that could buy GPS. Buhari came and removed everything and said, \u201cAnybody who wants to buy GPS can go and buy.\u201d\n\nNow, people can buy GPS. So GPS starts producing PS. You have in the country people know who and who is producing. And the fact that he said we won\u2019t use our dollar from NNPC to go and buy GPS outside means that even though it is more expensive, because if you buy chicken from outside it is $1. If you buy from Nigeria it is $3 but at least, we have started producing. It will get to a point where MTN got. Remember, when we started the GSM, it was very expensive, as soon as everybody stepped into the market, the thing started coming down. Now, everybody is saying there is glut. Sometimes, there is a glut in the poultry market, because everybody is now producing.\n\nYou know India or Croatia is the highest producer of banana but you know India imports banana because they are 1.4 billion people. In Rivers State, I had a banana plantation as a government. The young man who came there chased away the Mexican company. This thing you people call RUGA started in Rivers State. We got N3 billion, paid Israeli company to come and gave them 10,000 hectares of land to start constructing houses for 1000 persons. They built schools, markets, church for those who wanted to go to church. So the housing was for accommodation and each person had 100 hectares of land. As soon as the man came, he took the money back from the Israeli company and the company left. The company was introduced to me by Obi Ezekwesili.\n\nSo imagine 1000 people in 10,000 hectares of land all farming. Even if they don\u2019t feed anybody, they will feed their 1000 wives. They will feed their children, that means you have taken out 3,000 people from the poverty index. You see, what the president is doing is to create opportunities. If you want the government to give you approval, show him evidence of how many jobs it will create. So when you said it was not our government, I wonder how. Take the railway for instance, it was the Obasanjo government that started railway modernisation but that was theory, which was on paper. When I came, I dusted the paper and read it through and I said, let\u2019s go to the field.\n\nThe Goodluck Jonathan government started the Abuja-Kaduna, but at a point they stopped. They could not pay the money. We had to pay the money. When I came, I told the President to call the minister of finance, and the woman said, I should go and look for money. The woman still insisted on the budget, and the president said, \u2018Okay, I agree with you. I am a man of the rule of law, so the budget. But before the end of the budget, look for this fund\u2019. There is no fund that will be used to fund this project. And it was up to N18 billion, so he said, give it to Amaechi. Amaechi you start spending when the budget is approved. As soon as the budget was approved, she gave me money to go and start Abuja-Kaduna. But as a good man that I am, I made sure we did not forget President Goodlck Jonathan.\n\nHow are you addressing vandalism?\n\nIt is mostly between Nasarawa, Jos and some parts of the South East and then Port Harcourt. It is the law that is the problem, because the law says if you are arrested, let\u2019s say you take 10 tons of cargo and it is N10 million for instance, and the law says you will pay N200, 000, won\u2019t you take the risk? It is an old law but President Obasanjo had sent an amendment of the law to the National Assembly as far back as when he was in government and nothing has been done. We are arresting them but not much is being done. In fact, most times, the Nigerian Railway Corporation is complaining that we are paying for their feeding.\n\nThere has been a lot of controversy surrounding the Secured Anchorage Area, what is the situation now?\n\nThe president has approved the cancellation.\n\nDoes the government have the capacity to secure the country\u2019s maritime domain?\n\nWhat capacity did the company that was doing it have? You have about three to four vessels, you arrest all vessels coming to Lagos, so you say, listen, we will escort you to Lagos, because our job is to protect you, park here, that is the anchor. So park here and we will keep you for 30 days. Meanwhile, your plan is to enter Lagos and go back the next day. The first day you pay $2500, the next day you pay $1500. $1500 multiplied by 29 days plus $2500 that made it 30 days. You are carting away a $100 and something million for doing nothing. So I kept quiet so that they wouldn\u2019t accuse me of taking away their business. When I finished with the deep blue project, I called him and said, it is time for you to leave. He said why, I said because we now have the capacity to protect our waters.\n\nNIMASA has provided that capacity of having more vessels. I am just coming from a NIMASA programme and I saw the vessels, so we have them now. He said, okay what do we do, can\u2019t you hire us? I said why am I hiring you, for what? I have the equipment. I have the personnel, what am I hiring you for? So the battle started again, just like the foreign people who are petitioning now. The president set up a committee, one headed by the VP, the other headed by the minister of defence and then the EFCC.\n\nDon\u2019t forget this same issue consumed the former minister of transport. I told the president, sir, how much is in maritime? The budget in the federal ministry of transport is N6 million. That is the budget of maritime. Where the money is in the maritime is in NIMASA, NPA and all these our agencies but that is not the real money; that is not the money they are looking for.\n\nThe money they are looking for is illegal money inside maritime. When I read what a former chief of naval staff wrote against me, I laughed. I am sure he didn\u2019t want me to address it publicly. What is the interest of the former chief of naval staff? Okay, what about NNPC? There are actors that cause confusion in the waters and go to NNPC to ask for security contracts. If you aggregate all the monies that non-state actors are diverting, vis-a-vis the ones that state actors are diverting, you will see that Nigeria is bleeding more from the non-state actors than state actors. In that case, I said I was ready to die on this matter. When NIMASA paid $20 million to the company, the company from day one said our account, our company \u2013 we are in Seychelles. So once they saw an official transfer from NIMASA to the company in Seychelles, they petitioned against me. They said they have caught Amaechi. I wonder why they have not released the report since. Before I went to the president, they had started this fight amongst themselves on how to share their money. One of them went to the newspaper and said he gave the presidency 8 million dollars, National Assembly 10 million dollars.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the president was convinced that something was wrong. He felt that the level of corruption going on needed to be checked, because who pays the money? It was not transport, it was not the federal government. It was because of that money they were adding. If a camera is $10 dollars in Ghana, because they have added $500 on that camera, the owner will pass it back to you ordinary Nigerian. So who are the people being cheated? The ordinary Nigerians! The president realised that the ordinary Nigerians were being cheated. First, there was no contract, it was just them harassing poor people like us. What they had was an understanding with the navy. So I wrote to the navy and said it was not the responsibility of them or anybody on earth to decide what was an anchorage area. The law says the honourable minister of transport will. I therefore said I did not give it an anchorage area. So the president has solved it.\n\nNow, INTELS. The federal government is believed to have lost several billions since INTELS took NPA to court over the pilotage contract a year ago. But recently, the FG announced plans to award the contract for another 25 years to the same INTELS that was disqualified for violating bidding rules for contracts? Does that make sense?\n\nThere are two answers. The first answer is, it will be sub judice since it is one of the issues before the panel of investigation. The second answer is, ask the NPA whether they followed due process in proceeding with it. There is a process. You must come to the ministry of transport, and they didn\u2019t come for the bidding process. So I wrote to them and said no, I don\u2019t agree, that they didn\u2019t follow the process. And I also wrote to the president and he approved.\n\nIt appears you were not briefed on the INTELS matter. INTELS built two berths at Onne Port for $2.5 billion and it was amortised for 10 years. But the contract didn\u2019t speak to who collects revenue. INTELS\u2019s argument is therefore that they built the berth, so they must collect the revenue from the pilotage contract, which is a different agreement to offset the debt. But the NPA said anyone could collect revenue as long as the debt is paid. But INTELS has collected the revenue for over 10 years at 38% from the government, then, the balance goes to offsetting the debt. How do you reconcile this?\n\nFor all those issues, let NPA and INTELS sit down and iron it out. NPA doesn\u2019t agree with INTELS\u2019s standard. What the president is interested in is what is lawful and what is right. But again, as I said, this matter would be sub judice; it is before a panel.\n\nIs it true that the suspension of the former NPA has to do with the fallout from the INTELS matter and the Lagos Channel Management contract?\n\nDid you see the letter that was approved by the president? We never ever mentioned INTELS. We never ever knew there was a crisis between INTELS and NPA. When the NPA wrote to me, I didn\u2019t even know they were proceeding, because I wrote that you couldn\u2019t proceed. There were two contracts that I told NPA that they couldn\u2019t proceed with. The first one is this and the second one is the channel management. In writing, I told NPA that you are spending N57 billion a year for channel management, why not buy the equipment. Those white men don\u2019t use white people to do this thing, they use Nigerians to do it. The difference is the equipment, which you can\u2019t go to the market and buy. They\u2019ll say because I am Nigerian they won\u2019t sell to you. So buy the equipment and come and do it here.\n\nSince 2019, they ignored me, until it was critical. That is the argument they are making now that it is too critical. We can\u2019t afford to buy it now. Before we can finish the process to buy the equipment, it will take us two or three years. But I knew about it. I wrote to you in 2019 to say that I would not support this contract, because I thought Nigerians could do it. Now, the contract has got to N104 billion for all the channels by their bidding process. And I said I won\u2019t send it to the cabinet, because for me, why do I have to buy that cloth in London if it is here? I said they should not renew the channel contract. Don\u2019t forget that what most ministers like is this kind of situation, where contracts are expiring in their time. I could have just renewed it and collected some of the contract. But from day one, I said no; that we must move forward. We will save this country money. The first year, it may even be more than N57 billion to buy the equipment, so you buy the equipment, you deliver it. Let\u2019s even say it is N90 billion, next year you will only pay salaries. To be paying N57 billion every year for 15 years, Nigeria is bleeding.\n\nBut it was alleged that you declined to take it to cabinet because you recommended two Chinese firms and the NPA turned you down.\n\nDo you know me very well? If you know me very well, you will know that I will never call any of my agencies and recommend a contractor. Even as a governor, I didn\u2019t call my commissioners to say they should go and give a job to somebody. Just like president Buhari gave me a free hand to run my ministry, that is the way I gave everybody a free hand to run their agencies. But do you really think as the minister in charge, they would not concede to me if I asked for two from the contracts? That must be a joke. The truth is, I was not interested but just wanted the right thing to be done. Period!\n\nYou suspended Hadiza in March and up till now, the committee has still not finished. Is the delay intentional?\n\nI did not suspend Hadiza nor did I recommend her suspension. If you read the letter, the letter stated to the president, \u2018Mr President, I am the minister for transport, I don\u2019t know what is happening in NPA. Not one day have they reported to me or told me what is going on. Mr President, I would like to know what is going on. I want an audit.\u2019 The president approved. From nowhere, the auditor general refused because that is his power. So I wrote the president that I no longer want an audit, I want to do what they call administrative enquiry. But let the Managing Director of NPA just step aside. So that is not suspension, in civil service they say, you are hereby suspended. And she is not under investigation. The MD of NPA, Hadiza Bala-Usma, is not under investigation; it is NPA that is being investigated.\n\nBut it has taken seven months to carry out an administrative inquiry without a report.\n\nThe panel has not finished. They are investigating five years. One year alone will take them 10 months. But have it at the back of your mind that all we are doing is going through what happened in NPA for the five years that I never knew anything about NPA.\n\nAre you likely to recall her?\n\nI am not the president. That is the decision for the president. I will only send the panel report to the president. If the president is convinced that she should come back, so be it. If you look at the NPA law, only the president has the powers to fire or hire. The minister doesn\u2019t have any power to hire.\n\nIt was said that you instigated her suspension because both of you were not working well and you have just insinuated it too by saying you didn\u2019t know what was happening in NPA.\n\nIf you know me well, I am a very busy administrator. I like smart people around me. They do all the work, I get the credit. So there is no way you will say I will be angry with the MD of NPA if she was doing her job according to the law. And the law includes the fact that you should come to the minister for approvals. There is something we are querying now in NPA, I just saw the file yesterday and I asked the permanent secretary to brief me. I don\u2019t know if I should tell you this, but let me give you an example. We had an agreement with Lekki Deep Seaport. The permanent secretary said an unknown person went and entered into a second agreement without the knowledge of the ministry. Meanwhile, the minister doesn\u2019t have the power for such an agreement. The right thing is to go to the cabinet. I saw it yesterday and I read it once and read it the second time. But how do you sit in an office and somebody in NPA, whoever the person is, goes to drop a second agreement with Lekki Deep Seaport? And it has to do with exclusivity.\n\nYou said NPA is being investigated and not Hadiza, yet, you reported to the president that funds were not being remitted to the federation account, even when the ED F&A, who was a key figure in the NPA management, was appointed to Act pending the outcome of the investigation. How do you even explain that away?\n\nWhy not wait till the report is out? You have a structure, where the Managing Director of NPA is in charge of most of the issues. If today the ED finance has not remitted funds, whose responsibility is it to call me? If I want to see anybody in NPA, I don\u2019t go to Koko, all I need to do is to say, \u2018Perm Sec, tell the MD of NPA to see me.\u2019 I have friends in NIMASA, even when they come once, they raise NIMASA issues. I just tell them to go to the DG. That is the structure, just like the president does. If the president is asking everybody in transport, how will I run my ministry? So if you say I did not hold Koko responsible, there are two things that will happen: I am holding NPA responsible for not remitting funds, whoever is in charge should tell me who is not doing their job. If the panel says Koko didn\u2019t do his job, then, he will go.\n\nEven at that, it still doesn\u2019t smell nice that Koku is the acting MD when a panel is investigating NPA at a time he was the ED finance. Does it?\n\nThe management of NPA was not dissolved. I don\u2019t have such powers. Only the president can dissolve the management and board.\n\nRecently, you said Nigeria was the only country in the world where shipowners have no ship and the shipowners have replied you. They said you didn\u2019t know what you were saying. But what did you mean by that statement?\n\nOkay, let\u2019s even say it is true, tell me one Nigerian that\u2019s Ocean going? They all do carbotage. Finish! Again, I am the minister of transport, maybe I misspoke. What I mean by I misspoke is that I should be protecting my people; I should not be putting them out there. But if they want that debate, let\u2019s have a meeting on that. They know I know the people I spoke about. They have told me themselves.\n\nStill on shipowners, the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF) was designed to help Nigerians who don\u2019t have ocean-going vessels. Recently, you were quoted to have said the government had withdrawn the approval of the disbursement of the Fund. And the shipowners said you were not correct. From their own investigation, the approval has not been withdrawn. The question is, has the approval been withdrawn? If it has been withdrawn, how then do you develop the sector?\n\nI will go back to the president. It took us three years to get approval from the president, because there were so many interests. The president minuted to the attorney general, who then advised that it was not public money; that it was money belonging to those who do business in maritime, especially shipowners and that it is held in trust by government. That the government should disburse to them, and the president approved. Then, we sent it to the ministry of finance, asking them to release the money according to the law to a specific bank, without telling us (ministry of finance), they wrote back to the president and said it was public money.\n\nBut NIMASA has been doing Cabotage waiver for foreign players, which the law forbids.\n\nWhen did NIMASA do that? Please can you show me because that ends with the minister and I have never signed any of them?\n\nSo if there is no cabotage waiver how are the foreigners operating in the industry?\n\n(NIMASA DG, Badhir Jamoh, who was present, interjects\u2026) \u201cWe don\u2019t give a waiver. There are two issues, one, only the minister can give waiver and NIMASA has a duty to process the waiver. So if you are a shipping company, you apply for a waiver and we process it. And when we process it, we send it to the minister. But the pattern and the main way the ministers operate, they don\u2019t want to give the waivers. So usually most ministers, if they come, they don\u2019t attend to those applications. But NIMASA continues to file in the applications on the processing of the waiver. The owners of those waivers assume once they pay and they have a receipt, they will go and continue trading. This matter went to the National Assembly, it called us and said we were giving waivers.\n\n\u201cWe said we don\u2019t give waivers. We said give us the evidence where we issued a waiver, and they didn\u2019t have. The person responsible for waiver is the minister; this is what the act says. So they called the minister and he said, call the DG NIMASA; I have never given approval. When these two contradictory statements came, I now went to NIMASA and said all application forms received in respect of waiver and processed, send it to the honourable minister. If he doesn\u2019t want to give, let him send it to us that he does not want to give. And that is the position till today.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the railway. The frequency of breakdowns of the locomotives has cast doubt on the quality of what you have. Aren\u2019t you concerned too?\n\nYou are right about breakdowns, and it happened only in Kaduna-Abuja. But from 2016 till now, we have not replaced anything. We have run out of rolling stock. It is good to be a governor. As a governor, I can go and buy the rolling stock, but here, I have to advertise; I have to get approval from the president. The president gave me approval about four or five months ago. I have to do what you people refer to as due process. If I don\u2019t do it, it will be on the front pages of the newspapers. So we are doing the due process to go and buy rolling stock. Rolling stock has been there since 2016 . We don\u2019t have enough anymore to recover or to keep the rail running. If some are bad, we replace them and they move. So we will continue to have breakdowns. You should even praise Nigerian engineers. Recently, we have never had any breakdown. They fixed the rail after the attack. It was a young lady engineer that did it. I thanked her and said Nigerian media will not see this.\n\nStill, a lot of people are attributing the breakdowns to poor quality\n\nJust imagine that you have not eaten for four or six years, will you still be alive? So I said until we buy those rolling stocks, I don\u2019t know whether it will be bought while I am in office, because of the due process. Because at the end of the due process, I still have to go to the cabinet. Take Lagos-Ibadan, if it is a state governor, it is easy but we are doing due process and it took us over six months to get this thing from ICRC. Now that we have got it, we are advertising it and we will give them six weeks, then, we will start our own internal due process.\n\nWhen we finish, then, we\u2019ll go to the cabinet. In fact, when we came to government at the beginning of 2016, the majority of members of cabinet were of the view that they should give us some emergency powers. But then people screamed, and they stepped that idea down. But if we had those emergency powers, all we need to do is to call, say, a Chinese company to supply us what we need. But because we have to do due process, it takes time.\n\nLet\u2019s play some politics. The All Progressives Congress (APC) is conflicted seriously in Rivers, and your friend, Magnus Abe is at loggerheads with your own faction in the state.\n\nIf you call an APC meeting now in Rivers State, who would you call? The law simply says there is a national APC, and the national APC sends people to organise primaries. If somebody says he is a parallel APC, he is on his own. It is like saying, because I established one oil company, I am now the NNPC.\n\nWhat will it take for the crisis in Rivers APC to be resolved?\n\nI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even know there is a crisis in Rivers APC, because I am a member of Rivers APC, but I am not the chairman of APC in Rivers State neither am I the secretary.\n\nBut you are a central figure in the party and also in the thick of the crisis.\n\nThe question is, what are these issues? Am I running to be a governor, apart from being a former governor of Rivers State, I can\u2019t be Rivers state governor again. The law forbids that, however, I can be governor of Ogun State, but I can\u2019t be governor of Rivers State again. So I am not among those in contention. You should ask those parties that are contending for the governorship of Rivers State.\n\nAre you not worried that what happened in 2019 as a result of your scuffle with Senator Abbe could repeat itself in 2023, if you do not come together?\n\nHow will it happen? If they repeat what they did the last time, you will see what will happen. They were celebrating the last time. No known politician will allow what happened the last time to happen again. They went to court. Have you seen a situation where even a judge asked a party to a matter to come and was pointing their lawyer to them? The party refused and said it was not their lawyer. The last time we didn\u2019t speak because we wanted to respect institutions, Now, this is the last lap.\n\nYou will say to yourself, how will it happen again? I don\u2019t know how it will happen, I am not God, but I know that I am not in conflict with anybody in the party in the state.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the last time the court judgment came and the Supreme Court said, you people should go home and make peace. I came to the party in the state and I rallied everybody. And I said gentlemen, no victor, no vanquished, let everybody come together, we don\u2019t need to make trouble and all that. But just because I said me, Chibuike Amaechi will support a riverine candidate, the trouble started again. So until somebody is made governor of Rivers State, you are not at peace? You can only be a good man when that man is made governor? They are denying me my right in choosing who I want to support. And I have said whether they like it or not, the whole Rivers State can go upland, for me, justice is served if I support a riverine man.\n\nWhy? Upland has been governor for 20 years, which is unfair. If Wike is the best governor, there can be another Wike in the riverine. So upland, allow these riverine people even if it is four years. And you can take the power from the riverine, any day you wake up and say I want back power. You will take it so easily. There are 18 local governments in the riverine area and 15 upland and, Ikwere alone has 2 million votes as at the time I left. So any day, Ikwere wakes up and say, we want back our power, they can do it. But allow what is fair and just; allow them governorship and that\u2019s all I said. In fact, I say I don\u2019t have a candidate, whatever candidate you people bring from the riverine, I will support. That is the quarrel in Rivers State APC.\n\nDo you think APC, as it stands today in Rivers, has what it takes to challenge a Governor Wike-led PDP?\n\nWait until the elections. The last time, how did he defeat us? They used government institutions to defeat us.\n\nNo, that\u2019s not correct, minister. You were alleged to have used the military to try to take power\n\nI did not use the military. I did not even know there was military at Abonnema. I swear to God. I\u2019m not joking. When I heard about the shooting at Abonnema, then, I asked: what happened at Abonnema that you people went there to shoot? That\u2019s when I heard that a military officer, protecting INEC\u2019s materials was standing like this; a lieutenant Colonel in the army, and you were courageous enough to shoot him?\n\nWho shot him?\n\nWhichever Thugs. The man slumped and died, then, the military immediately opened fire to save themselves.\n\nBut there was a body of women, protesting?\n\nPlease, please, could they come out? Can any woman come out in that kind of situation? They came out after and said they were demonstrating. What sort of demonstration? Even a policeman, you can\u2019t past the policemen. But you see an army officer guarding INEC\u2019s materials and you opened fire? Did they tell you that they went to Obi Akpo? A sitting government, shot an army Colonel and took Obi Akpo\u2019s results? Did they tell you that? You know one thing about our journalists? Before you write, always make proper investigation.\n\nDo you really want us to believe that..?\n\nThat is what happened, I did not not use the military\n\nLet me take you back to the rail issue. You are the man in charge of the railway today at the national level, looking back at your time in Rivers State, you started a monorail of about 1.5 kilometres in length that you could not complete. How does that make you feel?\n\nIt\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s about 5.3 kilometres not 1.5 kilometres. The only thing remaining for that rail to be completed was the last station, that required less than N1 billion to complete. The problem is, when you pick young boys and give them what they cannot carry\u2026Listen, I don\u2019t want to go into that. Truth is, we have finished the tracks, we bought the coaches and locomotives. It was the consultant that advised us to extend it to the last station so that more trains can come and park. We awarded the contract for about N1billion or N2 billion. But the man there refused to complete it. What about the schools that they stopped? We will talk about all these during the election. Now, I am obeying my lawyers and publicist who have advised me not to talk. I am writing a book, Nigerians will know more when the book is released.\n\nYour party has been in power for over six years and the country is a mess now.\n\nWho told you that? I disagree with you\n\nThe statistics are there: insecurity everywhere, the economy is paralysed. Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world under your party. No one can travel by road anymore, yet, you think the APC is a big deal?\n\nThat is not true. When my CSO died, I drove from Abuja to Asaba. I have told you when we were discussing that the reason for Boko Haram is not religion, it is not Muslims looking for Christians; it is basically the fact that there was a lack of education and poverty. Until we address that, the challenges will remain with us. Now, take for instance, I say go and open this station in Borno, they will say Amaechi is Hausa-Fulani man. You have forgotten that the reason is that some areas in the north tend to be poorer than some areas in the south. And there is a need for us as a country to balance out. You must balance out deliberately. Government must make deliberate efforts to do this.\n\nLook, if you make me president tomorrow, I am going to run free education especially, in the north. Let the government fund free education, because the same people you are denying free education today are the people that are not allowing you to rest. There is no boundary for kidnapping, even the herdsmen you are talking about, we must find strategic measures to deal with the issue. You can\u2019t just say don\u2019t come to Rivers, or don\u2019t come to Ogun State, no. The governors must meet as a people and say the reason why this is happening is XYZ. We will agree that we will partner the federal government to do the following and find solutions to them. Now, there are only two places people go to in Nigeria. There are 36 states and the FCT, but only two are functional \u2013 Abuja and Lagos. And why you are functional here (Lagos) is because of the federal government. The federal government will rather die than have anything happen to Lagos because of our economy.\n\nThen, Abuja the same. Why are other places abandoned?\n\nYou and I, the rich men, when we are stealing the money that belongs to the people, didn\u2019t we know? It has got to a point where access to public funds is no longer possible, because Buhari stopped people from getting access to public funds, except you do project. There is always a choice we have to make between infrastructure development and just spending the money recklessly. At other times, we\u2019ve been reckless with our expenditures. We have never addressed infrastructure. I remember what the president asks me all the time, he says, \u201cAmaechi, when you go to Cape Town, how do you feel?\u201d I say I feel ashamed. Cape Town looks like overseas. When you go to Cape Town, you won\u2019t believe it is a South African environment. So for him, he wants a replication of Cape Town in all parts of Nigeria. He thinks that we can build railways everywhere no matter how bad it is.\n\nAnd I continue to remember the question he asked me, \u201cAmaechi if those people, who were heads of state by that time we had money, had done this railroad, would we be doing railroad now?\u201d No. We have been reckless with our funding. To address what you said, poverty is the basic factor for the issue of kidnapping, the issue of insecurity and all that. When I was governor of Rivers State, there was one statement I made clearly and I still maintain that. I said because few governments and Nigerian elites refused to provide a legal economy for the poor, the poor will provide for themselves an illegal economy. What I am trying to say is that poverty did not start with Buhari\u2019s government. What I said was that, what is happening today started long ago. If we all went to school, we would not be looking for employment.\n\nBy the time there was this Tunisian revolution, everybody was educated in Tunisia. If we took time to put people in school, train them, then, you will have manpower.\n\nLet me say this here, that all these railways we are building, what are we carrying? We did not create this poverty that people are blaming us for, it is just that the poverty showed in our time in office. If the poverty had tarried a bit, we would have finished our tenure and leave, and the next government would have suffered it. Buhari came and inherited it but he realised that the way to address it is not by sharing the little money we have, it is to provide infrastructure. If that infrastructure is able to provide employment, we would not be here, because everybody will be at work. I will repeat what I used to say those days. If all of us are working in Shell, would we have time to go and steal? You will be at work, and by 6pm, you\u2019ll go home.\n\nI will give you another example. There is one of my friends, he kept telling me that his wife was giving him problems. And I said what is the problem? He said she used to ask where are you, where did you go to? I said I have the solution, he said what is the solution? Is she employed, he said no. I said bring her. We gave her a job and now, when she gets home by 6pm, she sleeps off. Even if the husband comes back by 2am she does not know because at 6am she is awake rushing to work. He told me ah! Now that there is peace in his house. So when you say there is poverty and insecurity, it is not because our government is reckless; it is because we inherited poverty. There is crime because people are not engaged.\n\nWe inherited $2.5 billion in excess crude account, which was between $50 and $60 billion that Obasanjo left. They said, oh, the governors said they should pay them. What they paid us was only $10 billion, how did we say they should share the money? The constitution says you must hold an economic council meeting minimum of once a month. We came for the first month, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said we have spent $1 billion, the president approved. Next month, the president approved, third month, and the fourth month. This money is for the local government, state and federal, he can\u2019t be approving for himself alone, let him approve for us too. We fought and fought and they disbursed $10 billion, in which they still took 56% and we took the remaining.\n\nSo what happened to the difference? The day they were leaving the government, what was left for President Buhari was $2.5 billion. I am speaking as a former chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum. Nobody will accuse me of divulging government information, because this is privileged information I got to know. What was the first problem that confronted us? If you don\u2019t give states money to pay salaries, there would be revolution in Nigeria. To avoid that revolution, states were given money, but don\u2019t forget there was no money. We are not magicians. You should praise Buhari. This insecurity and poverty were created before we came. Nigerians want to know how you are handling it, they don\u2019t want to know where it started from.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the burning issue of power shift. Many prominent northern figures are saying it is not by threatening that the heavens will fall that power will shift. That what the south should do is to negotiate power moving to their region. What\u2019s your view on this?\n\nIs there anywhere you play politics without negotiation? Even if they didn\u2019t say power shift, even if they say the North should produce the president, the man who wants to be president, won\u2019t he negotiate? Listen, Nigeria is such a big country, there is no place called South or North or East or West, it is all about interest. I tell people that when the Igbo, Ikwere and Hausa are sharing money, do you hear North or South? You only hear it when the sharing is not favourable. It is an elitist thing. The illiterate southerner and the poor northerner do not know that the rich northerner is colluding with the rich southerner to deny them opportunities. In fact, I always say that the day these two people will come together, all the elites will run away.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think it is an issue. I just think that the politics of merit, the politics of national interest should be above other considerations, because we must know that this country has to be one, it is not at all costs but there is benefit in being one. Market is by size, the problem today why our market is not important to anybody is because we don\u2019t have the purchasing power. The day everybody has the purchasing power, even those who said they are killing here will come here to be killed. But unfortunately, many Nigerian can\u2019t purchase things. What can you purchase and where is the money? You are hearing today, North, South, East and West because there is no purchasing power.\n\nThe reason you are seeing all the ills is the economy is not working. Mind you, it is not by Buhari; it started before he came. Don\u2019t forget that when he was head of state in 1983, he inherited a similar situation from Shagari. So you are hearing power shift because the elites are talking about how to share power and share the wealth of the country. It is beyond just power shift, it is a thing that you must say to yourself; if I take this action now, will the country divide? You must consider the issue of national interest. Will there be insecurity? Will the people suffer? There is no politics without negotiation.\n\nDo you think you have what it takes to be the president of Nigeria?\n\nThat is a more difficult question to answer. And I will tell you why. Whatever capacity I deployed in Rivers State, still exists in me. One of the things I heard before I became governor of Rivers State was that, \u2018he is too young, he is too rascally.\u2019 But when I came, within six months, the kidnappers were on the run. I am the first Nigerian to call them criminals. Look at what they are doing, they are killing people, and if you kill people, are you not a criminal? You see, government has the coercive capacity to put anybody down, it depends on whether you want to deploy it or not. So being president is not an issue, I should focus on the responsibilities I have been given.\n\nWhat are the attributes you want the next president of Nigeria to have?\n\nThe next president must first ensure that we have a united country. These elites must leave him alone to do his job, because the problem we have is that the elites are causing problem. Before, you had a Nigeria where people just gather because someone has just turned 50 and you spend $1 million dollars that could have been used to open an industry and employ people. I just spoke to you how the maritime sector is a problem to us. As speaker, 40% of my friends were Yoruba. There was no Yoruba speaker that was not my friend when I was a speaker. There was nothing like you are a northerner or a southerner, we were just comrades and friends.\n\nIn 2015, your party proposed three things, economy, corruption and security. In 2019, it reinforced the same thing and incidentally you were the campaign DG in both instances. Can you rate your party on these accounts?\n\nI rate us 90 per cent. Let\u2019s start with security, it could have been worse. When we came, states were unable to pay salaries. At that time, only Rivers State and Lagos could pay salaries. Out of 36 you are talking of 34 states that would have been on fire. And don\u2019t forget we went into recession. Pundits, World Bank said it would take three years for Buhari to come out of recession. But it took him one year; in fact, it took him nine months. It is in this government that two past governors were jailed.\n\nPre-2015, your relationship with President Buhari. What is it now and what kind of man is he?\n\nIt\u2019s the same. The only difference is now you have a president. Before I could joke and say, \u201cOga you know I am the campaign DG, everybody should obey the DG.\u201d He would laugh and say, \u201cOkay, oga DG, you are the power man; go ahead.\u201d Now, go and tell him you are the DG and he will ask you who is the president. He may crack a joke, a lot of people don\u2019t know him. He jokes a lot. The only time you will not see the president crack jokes or laugh when you are cracking jokes is when a visitor enters, then, he takes his military discipline and keeps quiet, because he is a very quiet man. But the moment the visitor goes and he is in his natural environment, he will laugh. He is now the president, but beyond that, our relationship has been smooth.\n\nBut people say you have lost out in the power game\n\nWas there power?\n\nBut your access to the Villa is said to have been restricted. Are you denying that?\n\nMe?\n\nYes, there are rumours that you have lost out in the power game. Isn\u2019t it true?\n\nI didn\u2019t know there was a Villa power game. Honestly, I see the president anytime I want to see the president. I shouldn\u2019t be saying this, but I see the president anytime. All I need do is to inform his office that I\u2019d like to see the president and they will tell the president, \u201cAmaechi wants to see you,\u201d and he will give them appointment. I have never been stopped from seeing him.\n\nLastly, what do think about Nigeria? Do you think the people have a future together as a nation?\n\nHow can anyone suggest that and we are still here? When we graduated from the University of Port Harcourt, a lot of my classmates ran overseas, some of them are sending text messages now asking when they will come and see me. Nigeria is a land of opportunities. Just remain, work hard, be patient, pray hard and God will answer you. This is a virgin land in terms of agriculture. We have 200 million persons, just start a farm, feed only 10 million and see how rich you will be. The thing is, we want quick money. NNPC, bring this money and all that. When I retire, I am heading straight to the farm. If you feed 1 million persons with poultry at $1, how much is it? Nobody wants to do anything. We just want to see Buhari, Amaechi or Wike. Just start something small; don\u2019t go big at first, before you know it, you are big. You sell and make money. Nigeria is a land of opportunities; we should all work together and make this country great.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Buycoins is celebrating its history and the milestone of transitioning to Helicarrier, its new parent company, and is holding an event titled \u201cState of The Union\u201d on October 30 to mark it. While the discussions at the event would have far-reaching consequences on the state of cryptocurrency in the country, the event is exclusive and invite-only.\n\nBut before Buycoins, the company was called Bitkoin\u2014a website for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading.\n\nBuycoins was founded in 2017 by Timi Ajiboye, Ire Aderinokun and Tomiwa Lasebikan to afford Nigerians a safe and easy way to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies. After being called Buycoins for the past three years, the exchange and all the products created by its team will now be housed under the new parent company, Helicarrier.\n\nThe Buycoins team expressed that it made the change because its former name didn\u2019t do a good job of capturing all they do and have become. Similar to the name of the fictitious versatile super-machines that are capable of sustained flight via four massive turbine engines, Helicarrier currently houses over five which will power its efforts to disrupt remittance payment in Nigeria and, by extension, Africa.\n\nHelicarrier\u2019s five products are Buycoins, a platform for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies; Buycoins Pro, a platform for advanced crypto traders, featuring an order book, many more currency pairs and other tools for super-fast trading on the go; Sendcash, a platform for crypto-powered remittance; Sendcash Pay, a suite of developer tools that let you add borderless payment experiences to your digital products; and NGNT (Nigerian Naira Token), a naira-backed digital currency.\n\nAll the products will retain their names and normal operations, the Buycoins team explained.\n\nTo further understand Buycoins\u2019 work over the past three years, the challenging, fulfilling and exciting parts, and the rationale behind the change to a new name, I spoke with Tomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder and Chief Product Officer; Teju Adeyinka, Head of Growth, Sendcash; and Zino Asamaige, Head of Growth, Buycoins Pro.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSultan Quadri: What inspired you to build Buycoins, and what problems were you trying to solve with this product?\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan: So, I guess it was the challenge of getting started with crypto in Nigeria. There were times Timi and Ire would want to buy something from the US and want to send me Bitcoin as a means of payment for that. But being able to get Bitcoin in Nigeria was a pain. Back then, we had something called \u201clocal Bitcoins\u201d, but it was fraud-prone and the user experience was really bad. We all had conversations and thought, \u201cOh, how difficult would it be to build a crypto exchange?\u201d It was supposed to be a little project that enabled people to trade Bitcoin without stress. So, that was the start of the journey.\n\nSQ: What challenges did you encounter during the building process?\n\nTL: There have been a lot of things. One has been the challenge of hiring, especially because we are building something in a very new and rapidly-evolving space. So, we need people with the ability to keep up with the fast pace of the industry. That can be very challenging.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had issues with educating our users about cryptocurrency and the crypto space to protect them from scams. To get people on board, we\u2019ve had to change the dominant narrative that crypto was for geeky computer scientists and whatnot. Making people think of crypto as something they can use for moving money across borders or hedging against inflation has been an important aspect of our (re)orientation campaign.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was interfacing with regulatory systems\u2014although that\u2019s a global problem: big exchanges like Coinbase face regulatory challenges too.\n\nSQ: What are the challenges of building new products?\n\nTeju Adeyinka: Getting people who are willing to even try out the products is challenging. For instance, with Sendcash, people who have never used Bitcoin before might feel intimidated to try it out because of the interface. So, we had to figure out a way to craft our messages and build experiences that make sense for people who don\u2019t care about all the technicalities of using crypto.\n\nWe also had to deal with platforms\u2019 regulations. For instance, MailChimp reached out to say we can\u2019t use them anymore because we are a crypto exchange company and they don\u2019t support crypto exchange companies at the moment.\n\nWe constantly have to find alternatives for a lot of different things because people and platforms do not want to work with a crypto exchange company.\n\nZino Asamaige: When we launched, a bulk of the work had to do with educating customers. There were so many questions we didn\u2019t have answers to, but we couldn\u2019t just send them away. So, we learned more about the space or used Google when asked questions, all to ensure that our customers are satisfied.\n\nSQ: What were some of the most rewarding aspects of the building process and your earliest memorable milestone?\n\nTL: Back in November 2018, when we got our first dozen high-volume users, it was nice to see. Subsequently, there was a spike in trading volume and we knew we were building something useful. There were times we got comments like, \u201cSendcash is the best way for me to send money back home to my mum.\u201d During the lockdown, not everyone could stand in queues at Western Union, so using Sendcash to send money was easier. Providing a service that changes dollars or crypto to naira in a few minutes is satisfying.\n\nTL: Another early milestone was when we hit a million dollars in volume of transactions processed in a month, in the fall of 2018, just after YC Demo Day. Before Buycoins\u2014the app with a standard exchange interface, we had Bitkoin Africa, a website for P2P crypto trading, So, when in one day, we did more volume at Buycoins than in all of Bitkoin Africa\u2019s history, we were elated.\n\nAlso, in December last year, the last month we had publicly shared, we added $20 million in monthly volume.\n\nZA: We created a crypto course at Buycoins in 2019, and it has been one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done in my life. It was an introduction to Bitcoin for beginners. We spent a lot of time simplifying the language, making it easy for anyone to read and understand. Right now, we have over 3,000 people taking the course, and the feedback we get from people is particularly about the course is easy to understand.\n\nSQ: What influenced the change of name to Helicarrier?\n\nTL: Being able to define what we do is critical for us because a lot of times, with crypto, it\u2019s not very obvious the full range of things that people can do to be able to solve their problems. And so, it became increasingly clear to us that we were in danger of people narrowly defining what it is that we did. Some just think of us as a crypto exchange or platform for sending cash. It was something we wanted to fix. One day, it became clear to us that we\u2019re the sum of this box and more. So, we had to turn all of these things into a consistent story and define the set of tools that we think of as the infrastructure for growing crypto adoption on the continent.\n\nSo, fundamentally, we think of ourselves as sort of building out the infrastructure for the rapid adoption of crypto. Each of the things that we build as a part of Helicarrier serves a purpose, but we have to ensure that is clear.\n\nSo, there are four major things we do: the crypto exchange, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and the OTC desk, which is a way for businesses to effectively move money across borders. There\u2019s also one more exciting thing, still in the pipeline.\n\nSQ: How have you gone about communicating the changes that have occurred in the business this year?\n\nZA: Our users know that nothing has changed. From the point of view of using our products, they haven\u2019t had to do anything extra. All these products were not added in just one day; we gradually built them with the users. So, when we develop anything, the first thing we do is talk to customers about it.\n\nSQ: How are you making Buycoins safer for users?\n\nTL: Security is important to us because we are managing people\u2019s assets. There are many risk factors we always have to address, but one big thing is recognising that the problems we face are global challenges. So, what we do is, lean into the expertise of big exchanges like Binance, learn from their experience battling these problems and just replicate solutions where necessary.\n\nOne good example is asset custody, where we don\u2019t worry about building the infrastructure ourselves because there are crypto custody companies that have already solved this problem. We also ensure we take our own security measures: everyone who uses our platform is verified.\n\nSQ: What is the hardest part of your role in customer service?\n\nZA: The hardest part has been hiring. One thing that Helicarrier takes very seriously is customer service. We try to make sure that anybody that works with us is as obsessed with it as we are. A large part of customer support work is telling customers that their money is not missing. Customers that have their money on any app open the app every second to check. If they notice any unusual changes, they\u2019ll hit you up with \u201cWhere\u2019s my money?\u201d\n\nSQ: How were you able to manage customers during CBN\u2019s crackdown on crypto exchanges?\n\nTL: It\u2019s been one of the obvious challenging points in the company\u2019s lifecycle. We had to understand regulatory communication and ensure that we framed that effectively for our users and explained their implications to them. We let them know that their assets were completely safe.\n\nThe next thing was to figure out the shortest time for us to get back on our mission and ensure that users could do the things they want to do and extract the value they had always been able to extract from us.\n\nBehind the scenes, we were able to process how we arrived at the problem in the first place, which involved figuring out which regulators or stakeholders to talk to, helping them understand the importance of crypto, and letting them know we are good-faith actors and that there wasn\u2019t anything fishy going on in the space. We let them know that we have the same goal, which is to empower Nigerians.\n\nSQ: How would you describe the Buycoins users?\n\nZA: That would be somebody who doesn\u2019t want stress but wants to make cryptocurrency transactions. Or somebody who wants to be able to send money to Nigeria easily. Or somebody who wants to use cryptocurrencies to join a world of possibilities.\n\nTA: A Buycoins user is a global African, living on the continent or elsewhere, trying to connect to the world financially. A Helicarrier customer would be an African or a business that is traditionally shut out of the financial system but wants to access the global finance infrastructure easily.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",
          "summary": "We all had conversations and thought, \u201cOh, how difficult would it be to build a crypto exchange?\u201d It was supposed to be a little project that enabled people to trade Bitcoin without stress.\nFor instance, MailChimp reached out to say we can\u2019t use them anymore because we are a crypto exchange company and they don\u2019t support crypto exchange companies at the moment.\nSome just think of us as a crypto exchange or platform for sending cash.\nSo, there are four major things we do: the crypto exchange, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and the OTC desk, which is a way for businesses to effectively move money across borders.\nSQ: How would you describe the Buycoins users?",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel Africa, a subsidiary of India\u2019s Bharti-Airtel, has continued to surpass its profit and revenue margins recorded in previous quarters.\n\nIn Q1 2021, it recorded revenue of $1.03 billion, a 21.7% increase from Q1 2020, when it generated $899 million.\n\nAccording to the Q3 financial report released on Thursday, October 28, 2021, it recorded yet another impressive increase from Q3 2020.\n\nThe telecom company\u2019s revenue in Q3 2021 stood at $1.160 billion, a 22.7% increase from Q3 2020\u2019s $965 million, this, without considering currency fluctuations (constant currency). When we consider currency fluctuations (reported currency), the increase is 20.1%, a 2.6% difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice remains king, but data isn\u2019t doing too badly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue breakdown. (in millions)\n\nAs usual, voice brought in the most revenue at $578 million, while data and mobile money brought in $377 and $135 million, respectively.\n\nAlthough voice remains king, it only rose by 11.6% \u2014 $60 million \u2014 (reported currency) from Q3 2020\u2019s $518 million. Data went from $283 million to $377 million within the same period, signifying a 33.0% \u2014 $94 million \u2014 increase.\n\nMobile money increased by 34.6%, going from $100 million to $135 million in the same period.\n\nThe same trend was recorded in Q2 2021. Voice trumped other revenue sources at $562 million, followed by data and mobile money with $356 and $124 million, respectively.\n\nHowever, voice isn\u2019t only king at Airtel. According to MTN Nigeria\u2019s financials for Q3 2021, voice also led with a revenue of $234.3 million; data came in second at $137.68 million. The telecom company also recorded a similar revenue trend in Q3 2020.\n\nAirtel says it is focusing on increasing smartphone ownership, thereby increasing data usage. It will do this via its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partnerships and expanding its network of outlets selling smartphone devices.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), 4G connections in sub-Saharan Africa could reach 28% by 2025. This could increase data consumption, making data the new revenue king.\n\nAirtel\u2019s data subscribers increased to 43.9 million, a 10.9% jump from 39.6 million in Q3 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMobile money customer base experienced a 19% increase, rising from 20.1 million to 23.9 million when comparing Q3 2020 and Q3 2021.\n\nGenerally, Airtel has increased its customer base by 5.4% \u2014 116.4 million to 122.7 million \u2014 in the 14 African countries where it is present.\n\nFun fact: Data subscribers represent 35.8% of Airtel\u2019s customer base of 122.7 million\n\nProfits\n\nAirtel\u2019s profit before tax in the period in question was $308 million, an 81% increase from $170 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nProfit after tax, on the other hand, was $192 million, which is an impressive 118.6% increase from last year\u2019s $88 million.\n\nHowever, the year-on-year (YoY) growth rate falls short compared to Q2 2021\u2019s 148.7%. Its YoY revenue growth rate of 22.7% also pales in comparison to last quarter\u2019s 33.1%, figures it still attributes to the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020.\n\nIt says it is due to \u201ca weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region.\u201d\n\nNigeria remains cash cow, and data revenues are rising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue per region\n\nIn Nigeria, the telecom company recorded significant revenue growth compared to the preceding period. At constant currency, the revenue growth rate was 27.1%.\n\nHowever, the telecom giant recorded a 38.2% revenue growth rate in the previous quarter.\n\nAs always, Nigeria recorded the highest revenue of the 14 countries where Airtel is present. The country\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue stood at $450 million, a $73 million increase from $377 million in Q3 2020\n\nThe country\u2019s revenue surpassed the $428 million recorded in all the East African countries combined by $22 million.\n\nIn Francophone Africa, the company generated $285 million in revenue, $165 million behind Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria\u2019s data revenue growth rate was 41.5% \u2014 from $139 million to $179 million \u2014 in constant currency compared to the period before. However, in reported currency, the growth rate was 33.1%.\n\nWhile voice revenue had the lion\u2019s share, its growth rate was 14.6% at constant currency and 7.7% at reported currency. It rose from $216 million in Q3 2020 to $233 million in Q3 2021.\n\nAirtel attributes its data revenue growth to an increase in data usage per customer. It went from 2.7GB to 3.9GB per month.\n\nThe total customer base in Nigeria now stands at 40.4 million, unlike 44.1 million in Q3 2020. The customer base also dropped compared to the 40.9 million in Q2 2021. The discontinuation of customer acquisition led to the reduction in the country\u2019s total customer base.\n\nAirtel, however, maintained that the drop in customer base did not have a significant impact on its revenue.\n\nThe company says its Q3 2021 financials signify a well-executed and effective strategy. According to Airtel Africa CEO, Segun Ogunsanya, \u201cAll our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms, these are all in strong double digits.\u201d\n\n*Airtel\u2019s East African countries include Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.\n\n**Airtel\u2019s Francophone contingent includes Niger, Chad, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Seychelles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNCC\u2019s grace period\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint insights on school abductions\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s H1 results\n\nAnother NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised: Nigeria\u2019s federal government has announced that it\u2019s extending the deadline for NIN-SIM linkage to the \u201cend of the year 2021.\u201d\n\nSeventh time wasn\u2019t the charm: The first deadline was in December 2020, and by our count, this marks the eighth deadline extension in eleven months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy the change of heart? In what seems to be a customary ritual, appeals by the Mobile Network Operators and other industry stakeholders were heeded in making this decision.\n\nLike the last extension, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says the government\u2019s focus is still to foster registration of Nigerians in remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, foreigners, and diplomatic missions.\n\nA smattering of progress: In July 2021, the NCC said there were 59.8 million unique NIN enrolments. Per the Commission\u2019s latest statement, the number has grown to 66 million.\n\nAlso, as of October 30, 2021, there were over 9,500 enrolment systems and over 8,000 NIN enrolment centres within and outside the country. An increase from the 5,500 enrollment systems announced in July.\n\nConsidering the government\u2019s shift in focus to remote areas, among others, the drastic increase in enrollment systems seems a welcome development. But, with only a 10% increase in unique NIN enrollments from July to October, it appears the government still has its work cut out for it.\n\nNot surprising, if you\u2019ve read this: Inside Nigeria\u2019s 13-year-old quest for widespread digital identification.\n\nShould we give the government the benefit of the doubt?\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s school children abductions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 15, 2014, scores of Nigerians woke up to some disturbing news; at around 11 p.m. on April 14, 2014, 276 girls were kidnapped from their boarding school in Chibok, Northeastern Nigeria, by Boko Haram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven years later and more than a hundred Chibok girls are said to still be in captivity.\n\nSince then, at least 1,800 school children have been abducted.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, with 11 abductions this year, more school children were kidnapped in 2021 than in previous years.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s H1 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/27998473@N02/11982286343/\u201d>jbdodane</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nSome money news: On Thursday, October 28, 2021, Airtel Africa, a subsidiary of India\u2019s Bharti-Airtel, released its results for the half-year ended 30 September 2021.\n\nAccording to Segun Ogunsaya, Airtel Africa\u2019s new CEO, \u201cOur first-half financial performance has been strong.\n\n\u201cThe first half of last year, and especially Q1, was impacted by the start of Covid, but even after adjusting for these effects, our revenue growth rates for the half-year for the Group and all our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms these are all in strong double digits.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, revenue brought in by voice still sits at the top of the pile, raking in $1.14 trillion in comparison to $972 million in September 2020.\n\nData comes in a close second with $733 million, in comparison to $548 million in the same period last year.\n\nAll of these numbers, of course, have to be looked at in the light of certain intricacies like currency change \u2014 reported and constant.\n\nIf you have a head for numbers or are just naturally curious, then you\u2019d definitely want to read our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun\u2019s careful analysis of this report.\n\nSpoiler alert: I\u2019ve gotten a sneak peek, and there are a lot of numbers.\n\nA little more context from Intelligence by Techpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari said the fear and trauma of abduction are forcing children out of school.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, Nigeria currently has more than 10 million out-of-school children, mostly due to insecurity in the North, where school enrollment and literacy levels are very low.\n\nFlowing from our earlier discussion on the number of kidnapped children, the graph above shows the reported number of abducted school children in Nigeria by state since 2014.\n\nFor more insights like this, kindly follow @TechpointIntel on Twitter.\n\nTechpoint Africa headlines\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow banks can play in the booming crypto space.

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone. Image: Screenshot from \u2018How KaiOS Is Becoming the 3rd Major Mobile OS\u2019.\n\naYo Holdings, a micro-insurance joint venture between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH), announced yesterday, Thursday, October 28th, 2021, that it will be transforming its technology backend and data management approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means aYo will be modifying its business model.\n\nWhy? The company plans to drive greater scale, better customer experience, and faster access to markets across the African continent in the coming years.\n\nWhy should you care? Launched in 2017, aYo offers hospital and life cover in Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take?

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1. \u201cCome unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d. Mt. 11:28-30\n\nWhen an emperor, or a monarch or a head of state or president of a nation or the governor is holding any inaugural ceremony in any designated place, admission is often strictly by invitation! Before you enter the hall, you have to present your invitation card or else you would be turned back. The invitation is strictly meant for those that matter in the societies, for the very important persons. It is not so with our Lord Jesus. He cares for the salvation of the rich and the poor. In the scriptures he says \u2018come onto me all ye\u2019. It is for everybody. It is not an invitation whereby the rich would tell the poor: Hold on first I want to see him first. \u2018or stand outside first, I would see him first.\u2019 It is not the case of the gateman saying \u2018you cannot see him now, he is very busy, he is holding a meeting, or he has travelled.\u2019 Jesus does not travel; he has the whole world in his hands.\n\n2. Amazingly, Jesus is calling those who labour and are heavy laden. It is only people who labour and are heavy laden that need rest.\n\nWhat are your labours? Are your labours on how to get food for the children or on how to get the school fees for your children? Are your labours on how to get rid of that sickness that has been disturbing you for years or on how to overcome that sin that easily besets you? Or your labour has been on how to overcome the insurgents and the kidnappers and the Boko Harams or how to keep off the herdsmen who destroy farm crops and kill farmers? Could your labour be on how you can get a child after marriage?\n\nThere are indeed numerous things that people labour on to achieve which indeed bring great burdens to their hearts.\n\nWhat are the things that bring the greatest burdens to our weary souls? Sins are the things that cause the heaviest burden to people\u2019s souls. Sins keep people from seeing the face of God. Sins cause untold punishments to people who remain in sins. Sins make souls to be weary. Sins separate people from God, from Christ. Sin does not allow any rest of mind to people.\n\nTruly, there are many who have gone for confessions of their sins every week and they are still in those sins causing pain to their weary souls.\n\n3. Jesus never told any weary soul that came to him to come back later.\n\nHe gave pardon to all that asked for pardon and caused perfect rest to such turbulent hearts.\n\nWhen king David realized his sin he pleaded in the book of Psalm: \u201cHave mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions: Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.\u201d Psalm 51:1-2.\n\nThis is exactly what Jesus Christ came to do: \u201cI must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.\u201d Jn. 9:4\n\nSo Jesus Christ actually came to set people free from all the problems that confront them and from sins that easily beset them.\n\nWhen that woman from Samaria received pardon from Jesus Christ she went to preach Christ to people bringing them to Christ: \u201cCome, see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? And many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, he told me all that ever I did.\u201d Jn. 4:29,39.\n\nJesus still tells people today all they ever did through the Holy Spirit who brings them to their memories so that they can confess and repent. You also can tell Christ all you ever did and repent from them and also obtain pardon. Then you have rest.\n\n4. Except you are meek and lowly in heart like Jesus you cannot come to Christ to give you rest. Pride and arrogance block the way of humility in one\u2019s life and thus keeps one far away from Christ.\n\nAre we all ready to learn of Christ? Are people in their pride and in their religious fundamentalism still not proving that they did not need Christ?\n\nSuch people that refuse to come to Christ so that their yoke could be removed, keep on delaying in their ignorance till the Judgment day with their yoke of sin, yoke of hardness of heart, yoke of unbelief would stand against them.\n\nUntold number of people all over the world still do not know that the yoke of Christ is easy and that his burden is light. Look at this: \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d Act 16:30-31.\n\nJust that! Not more than that!

Our students every day suffer transportation to and fro from school but we observed that over one thousand busses that were bought for Soludo\u2019s campaign are rotting away. This is allowed because it is looted funds from the airport and other projects of the state so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nOkolo said the level of decay, especially in the state capital, Awka, leaves one wondering what the state government does with the huge resources of the state.\n\nAccording to him, Obiano administration inherited N75 billion from the Peter Obi administration, but the APGA government has allegedly \u201csquandered\u201d it.\n\n\u201cWastage of Anambra tax payer\u2019s money will not return APGA and its candidate, Prof Chukwuma Soludo to power as the Anambra electorate are wiser and better informed now more than ever before. Every reasonable person knows that APGA has lost steam under the current leadership. The party has failed woefully over time. The party hasn\u2019t been able to meet the wishes and aspirations of the people who gave them the mandate to lead.\n\n\u201cAnambra have to be part of the centre. Let be wise, we should have a good leader; Sen. Andy Uba is a leader who has what it takes to lead Anambra to prosperity. He will give us the right access to power and resources,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nMillionaire real estate scion Robert Durst was indicted Monday for the murder of his first wife, Kathie Durst, who disappeared nearly four decades ago, prosecutors said.\n\nThe second-degree murder indictment in the New York City suburbs comes weeks after an investigator in the case filed a criminal complaint against the 78-year-old Durst, who was recently sentenced to life in prison in California for killing a confidante who helped him cover up the slaying.\n\nDurst was transferred to a state prison medical unit last week less than two weeks after being hospitalized on a ventilator with COVID-19 following sentencing in the Los Angeles case.\n\nA warrant has been issued for his arrest in the killing of Kathie Durst, Westchester District Attorney Mimi Rocah said in a statement announcing the indictment.\n\n\u201cWhen Kathleen Durst disappeared on January 31, 1982, her family and friends were left with pain, anguish and questions that have contributed to their unfaltering pursuit of justice for the last 39 years,\u201d Rocah said.\n\nKathie Durst\u2019s 1982 disappearance garnered renewed public interest after HBO aired a documentary in 2015 in which the eccentric heir appeared to admit killing people, stepping off camera and muttering to himself on a live microphone: \u201cKilled them all, of course.\u201d\n\nThe grand jury that indicted Durst kept meeting and hearing witnesses even after State Police Investigator Joseph Becerra filed a criminal complaint in a town court in Lewisboro, New York, on Oct. 19 charging Durst with second-degree murder.\n\nKathie Durst was 29 and in her final months of medical school when she was last seen.\n\nRelated News U.S.millionaire Robert Durst convicted for killing best friend\n\nShe and Robert Durst, who was 38 at the time, had been married nearly nine years and were living in South Salem, a community in Lewisboro. Her body was never found.\n\nAt the request of her family, she was declared legally dead in 2017.\n\nRobert Durst\u2019s family owns more than 16 million square feet of real estate in New York and Philadelphia, including a 10% stake in One World Trade Center, the Manhattan skyscraper formerly known as the Freedom Tower.\n\nFamily members bought out Robert Durst\u2019s stake in the business for $65 million in 2006.\n\nIn the 2015 HBO documentary \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\u201d Durst appeared to admit killing people and admitted he made up details about what happened the night she disappeared because he was \u201choping that would just make everything go away.\u201d\n\nDurst, who has numerous medical issues, sat in a wheelchair for much of the California trial and sentencing hearing. He read his lawyer\u2019s questions from a tablet giving live transcriptions because he struggles with hearing.\n\nDurst, testifying in the Los Angeles trial in August, denied killing Kathie Durst. After her medical school called to report that she hadn\u2019t been going to class, he said he figured she was \u201cout someplace having fun\u201d and suggested that perhaps drug use was to blame.\n\n\u201cIt hadn\u2019t occurred to me that anything had happened to her,\u201d Durst said, speaking slowly in a strained, raspy voice. \u201cIt was more like: What had Kathie done to Kathie?\u201d\n\nAsked if he had any reaction to the indictment, Durst lawyer Chip Lewis replied in an email: \u201cFake news!\u201d",

          "text": "The initial firm handling the collapsed 21-storey building along Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos state, has said it pulled out of site when its clients insisted on going beyond 4-storey building.\n\nThe building, it was gathered, was under construction as at the time of the tragedy some few minutes past 2.00 pm Monday.\n\nIt was gathered that about 50 persons, including the building owner and site workers, were trapped.\n\nThe company, which had earlier constructed two buildings on the site, the letter said, clearly told its clients it could not guarantee the integrity of the third building (which ultimately collapsed).\n\nThe firm \u2013 Prowess Engineering Limited \u2013 withdrew its services February 2020.\n\nThis, it said, was because it no longer shared the same vision with its client- Fourscore Heights Limited as contained in the letter.\n\nTitled, \u2018Re: Proposed Gerrard Terraces For Fourscore Limited,\u2019 the letter was signed by the company\u2019s managing director, Muritala Olawale.\n\n\u201cThis letter is to formally inform you of the withdraw (sic) of our structural consultancy service from the above named project. We arrived at this decision due to the fact that we no longer share the same vision with you as our client in terms of how the project is being executed.\n\n\u201cWe can guarantee the integrity of the first two buildings and also work done up to the fourth floor of the third building supervised by us provided specifications have been met in terms of the required concrete strength. This we do not have control over as we do not have the concrete cube test results of each stage of the building till date. Also, note that we are not taking responsibility for any other construction errors that may have occurred overtime on the project.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we request that our company\u2019s name and logo be removed from the project board and also kindly notify all necessary approving authorities of our withdrawal from the project,\u201d the company said in the letter.\n\n4 dead, 4 rescued \u2015 NEMA\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged last night that no fewer than four persons had so far been rescued while four others were brought out dead from the rubbles of the collapsed building.\n\nSouth West Zonal Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Ibrahim Farinloye disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos Monday.\n\nNAN reports that many were feared trapped as the storey building under construction collapsed in Ikoyi.\n\nNEMA team and that of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) were still on ground trying to rescue trapped workers as at the time of this report.\n\nBlueprint gathered that despite the rescue efforts, many were still trapped in the rubbles.\n\nThis latest building collapse is coming barely a month after three persons were reportedly trapped and another killed when a building collapsed in Ikorodu area of Lagos state last month.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the possible cause for collapse and number of persons feared trapped in the latest incident, could not be ascertained as at the time of this report.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed report indicates that aside the destruction to cars and other properties and construction materials, about 50 persons were said to have been trapped.\n\nLASEMA spokesman, Nosa Okunbo, confirmed the incident in a terse electronic statement which said: \u201cA 25-storey building collapsed by Musliu Junction, Ikoyi, Lagos. LASEMA is on top of the situation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the agency\u2019s Director-General, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, in a brief response said LASEMA\u2019s heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment were already mobilised and deployed to the accident scene.\n\nOsanyintolu said: \u201cCollapsed Building at Gerard Road, Ikoyi: The agency has activated its emergency response plan to the above incident.\n\n\u201cAll first responders are en route to secure the scene while the heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment have been dispatched.\u201d\n\nThe state deputy governor, Femi Hamza, Commissioner for Special Duties & Intergovernmental Relations, Seye Oladejo, his physical planning counterpart, Dr Idris Salako and LASEMA boss were all at the site of the incident.\n\nAn eyewitnesses in the neighbourhood said, \u201cat least about 50 people are reportedly trapped under the rubble, including construction workers and other people who provided ancillary services for the workers.\u201d\n\nTimeline on Lagos building collapse\n\nBuilding collapses are common sights in Lagos. Hardly does a year pass by without cases with some resulting in the loss of many lives.\n\nFor instance, it was reported that 115 buildings, mostly residential, collapsed in Lagos between 2005 and 2016. And about 4,000 families have been left homeless and traumatised.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos state government is yet to issue any statement on the incident, but a reliable source within the state\u2019s ministry of work informed one of our correspondents that the ministry was still waiting to be briefed on the situation.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that scores of construction workers, including the owner of the building were reportedly trapped under the rubbles.",

We\u2019ve put ourselves in a reasonable position for COP in Glasgow but it\u2019s going to be very difficult in the next few days,\u201d Johnson said Sunday, before warning: \u201cIf Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails.\u201d\n\nThe Glasgow gathering, which runs until November 12, comes as an accelerating onslaught of extreme weather events across the world underscores the devastating impacts of climate change from 150 years of burning fossil fuels.\n\nThe current commitments of the signatories of the Paris agreement \u2014 if they were followed \u2014 would still lead to a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d warming of 2.7 Celsius, according to the UN.\n\nCOP26 marks the \u201clast, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach\u201d, summit president Alok Sharma said as he opened the meeting on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf we act now and we act together, we can protect our precious planet,\u201d he said.\n\nClimate advocacy groups expressed disappointment at the statement released at the end of the G20 summit.\n\n\u201cThese so-called leaders need to do better. They have another shot at this: starting tomorrow,\u201d said Namrata Chowdhary from the NGO 350.org.\n\nEyes On India\n\nWhile China, by far the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter, has just submitted to the UN its revised climate plan, which repeats a long-standing goal of peaking emissions by 2030, India is now at the centre of expectations.\n\nIndia has yet to submit a revised \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d but if Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces new efforts to curb emissions in his speech Monday, it could put more pressure on China and others, said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate and energy think tank E3G.\n\n\u201cIf he feels confident enough that there\u2019s going to be financing and technology assistance from Europe, the US, Japan and others, he might signal that India is willing to update its NDC,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nAnother pressing issue is the failure of rich countries to cough up $100 billion a year starting in 2020 to help developing nations lower emissions and adapt \u2014 a pledge first made in 2009.\n\nThis goal has been postponed to 2023, exacerbating the crisis of confidence between the North, responsible for global warming, and the South, which is the victim of its effects.\n\n\u201cClimate finance is not charity. It is a question of justice,\u201d stressed Lia Nicholson, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States vulnerable to climate change, also denouncing the refusal of large economies to abandon coal.\n\nForecasts by the UN climate experts panel (IPCC) that the threshold of a 1.5 Celsius increase could be reached 10 years earlier than expected, around 2030, are \u201cterrifying\u201d she said, particularly for those on the front line of the climate crisis who are already suffering the consequences in a world that has heated up by about 1.1 degrees Celsius.\n\nDespite everything, it seems that some are not afraid, or worse, that they are indifferent, she said.\n\n\u2018Not next year; Now\u2019\n\nHer words are likely to find an echo in the speeches from African and Pacific leaders on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nWhile the Chinese and Russian presidents are not expected in person, dozens of other heads of state and government from US President Joe Biden to EU leaders and Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison are making the trip to Glasgow.\n\nTheir words and actions will be closely scrutinised, in particular by the young activists who travelled to Scotland despite the obstacles due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAs citizens across the planet, we urge you to face up to the climate emergency,\u201d they said in an open letter from several of them, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who arrived Sunday by train.\n\n\u201cNot next year. Not next month. Now.\u201d",

Having clearly identified the terrorists\u2019 hideout, the Air Component of OPHK immediately dispatched two aircraft to conduct air interdiction on the location.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Troops Kill IPOB/ESN Gunmen In Anambra, Recover Rifles And Vehicles\n\nHe added that the strikes carried out under cover of darkness were successful and devastating, as battle damage assessment corroborated by local sources revealed that over 37 Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists were neutralised while several of them reportedly suffered varying degrees of injury.\n\nGeneral Nwachukwu further explained that as the aircraft retreated to base after the air interdiction, the combat air crew located another set of four gun trucks \u2013 about six kilometres south-west of Bama.\n\n\u201cThe air crew immediately relayed the coordinates of the location of the gun trucks to troops of the Land Component at Bama, who promptly engaged the location with artillery fire bombardment, neutralising the insurgents\u2019 gun trucks,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the army spokesman, the successful joint operations conducted by both the air and land components of the army, with the support of other security agencies under Operation Hadin Kai, again underscore the importance of synergy and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and insurgency.\n\nHe asserted that troops of OPHK remained resolute and unshaken in their effort to bring the insurgents to their knees.",

          "title": "World Leaders Take Centre Stage at Glasgow Climate Talks",
          "text": "It\u2019s time for more than 130 world leaders to feel the heat.\n\nThey will traipse to the podium Monday and Tuesday at crucial international climate talks in Scotland and talk about what their country is going to do about the threat of global warming. From U.S. President Joe Biden to Seychelles President Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan, they are expected to say how their nation will do its utmost, challenge colleagues to do more and generally turn up the rhetoric.\n\n\u201cHumanity has long since run down the clock on climate change,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to say during Monday\u2019s opening session, according to partial remarks released by his office late Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s one minute to midnight and we need to act now.\u201d\n\nThe biggest names, including Biden, Johnson, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Ibrahim Solih, president of hard hit Maldives, will take the stage Monday.\n\nAnd then the leaders will leave.\n\nThe idea is that they will do the big political give-and-take, setting out broad outlines of agreement, and then have other government officials hammer out the nagging but crucial details. That\u2019s what worked to make the historic 2015 Paris climate deal a success, former U.N. Climate Secretary Christiana Figueres told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cFor heads of state, it is actually a much better use of their strategic thinking,\u201d Figueres said.\n\nIn Paris, the two signature goals \u2014 trying to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times and net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2014 were created by this leaders-first process, Figueres said. In the unsuccessful 2009 Copenhagen meeting the leaders swooped in at the end.\n\nThousands lined up in a chilly wind in the Scottish city of Glasgow on Monday to get through a bottleneck at the entrance to the venue. But what will be noticeable are a handful of major absences at the summit known as COP26.\n\nXi Jinping, president of top carbon-polluting nation China, won\u2019t be in Glasgow. Figueres said his absence isn\u2019t that big a deal \u2014 though Biden chided China over the weekend \u2014 because he isn\u2019t leaving the country during the pandemic and his climate envoy is a veteran negotiator.\n\nMore troublesome are several small nations from the Pacific islands that couldn\u2019t make it because of COVID-19 restrictions and logistics. That\u2019s a big problem because their voices relay urgency, Figueres said.\n\nIn addition, the heads of several major emerging economies beyond China are also skipping the summit, including those from Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. That leaves India\u2019s Modi the only leader present from the so-called BRICS nations, which account for more than 40% of global emissions.\n\nKevin Conrad, a negotiator from Papua New Guinea who also chairs the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, said he\u2019s watching the big carbon-polluting nations. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for the United States and China to show leadership as the two largest emitters. If both of them can show it can be done, I think they give hope to the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists say the chances of meeting the goal to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius this century are slowly slipping away. The world has already warmed by more than 1.1C and current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C by the year 2100.\n\nThe amount of energy unleashed by such warming would melt much of the planet\u2019s ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, experts say.\n\nBut before the U.N. climate summit, the heads of the world\u2019s largest economies, at the close of their Group of 20 summit in Rome, offered vague climate pledges instead of commitments of firm action, saying they would seek carbon neutrality \u201cby or around mid-century.\u201d The G-20 countries also agreed to end public financing for coal-fired power generation abroad, but set no target for phasing out coal domestically \u2014 a clear nod to China and India.\n\nThe G-20 countries represent more than three-quarters of the world\u2019s climate-damaging emissions and summit host Italy, and Britain, which is hosting the Glasgow conference, had been hoping for more ambitious targets coming out of Rome.\n\nIndia, the world\u2019s third-biggest emitter, has yet to follow China, the U.S. and the European Union in setting a target for reaching \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions. Negotiators are hoping Modi will announce such a goal in Glasgow.\n\nThe Biden administration has tried hard to temper expectations that two weeks of climate talks will produce major breakthroughs on cutting climate-damaging emissions.\n\nRather than a quick fix, \u201cGlasgow is the beginning of this decade race, if you will,\u201d Biden\u2019s climate envoy, John Kerry, told reporters Sunday.",

The TPLF has not commented and there has been no confirmation of the killings.\n\nIt has been difficult to verify claims made by both sides in the conflict because communications have been restricted.\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed alarm over the escalating conflict. In a tweet, he said continued fighting only prolonged the dire humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia.\n\nThousands of people have been killed in the war, millions displaced and hundreds of thousands are facing famine conditions, the UN says.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict have also been accused of committing atrocities, but they both deny the allegations.\n\nThe war broke out on 4 November last year, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.\n\nHe said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops there.\n\nThe escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy\u2019s government and leaders of the TPLF, which was the dominant political party in Tigray.\n\nThe authorities later labelled the TPLF a terrorist organisation and ruled out any peace talks with them.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s renewed ground offensive in recent weeks, including using airstrikes has failed to halt the rebels\u2019 territorial gains.",
