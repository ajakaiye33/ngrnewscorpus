          "text": "Tasks INEC, security agencies to be non- partisan\n\nCandidates, parties to sign peace accord Wednesday\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013AS Ekiti State governorship election comes up on Saturday,the National Peace Committee has called on electorate in the state to choose peace over and above violence.\n\nThe committee in a statement, Monday evening by its chairman and former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar,retd, also tasked the people to step out without fear, \u201cbut with hope to exercise their franchise and vote to deepen the edemocratic process in Ekiti.\u201d\n\nIt appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission,INEC,and the security agencies to be non-partisan during the exercise.\n\nIt announced that a peace accord will be signed by the various political parties and stakeholders on Wednesday, June 15, 2022, at the Amazing Grace Events Hall, Ikokun, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State.\n\nThe statement read in part:\u201dWith the Ekiti State off-cycle governorship elections scheduled for June 18, 2022, the good people of Ekiti are once again called upon to step out without fear, but with hope to exercise their franchise and vote to deepen the edemocratic process in Ekiti.\n\n\u201cWith general elections months away, and despite the spike in violence across the country, the Ekiti State governorship elections offer a glimmer of hope and window of opportunity to assess how the 2023 elections will span out.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the National Peace Committee (NPC) would like to make the following observations:The commitment of the people of Ekiti to democratic ideals and the tenacity of ordinary Nigerians in support of our democracy and its processes, must be applauded in all its ramifications.\n\n\u201cIn the run-up to the Ekiti governorship elections, the people of Ekiti are the ones mobilised to attend the rallies, and on election day, they will most certainly abandon their means of livelihood, line-up for hours at polling units, often under harsh weather conditions, with no absolute guarantee for safety of their lives.\n\n\u201cYet, they will patiently wait and vote with hope that things will be better and that their living conditions will at least improve.\n\n\u201cThey carry the hope of generations yet unborn. This set of voters, not just in Ekiti but across the country, are the real custodians of democracy. Their willingness to step out and vote despite the disappointments that seem to accompany previous elections indicate that democracy in all its limitations has been accepted as the best form of government for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Committee said,\u201dWe are aware that the 2023 election may not be the best \u2013 as can be attested to by the monetisation of the process, the acrimonious conduct of the recent party primaries, and the elevation of the \u2018delegate position\u2019 over and above the welfare of ordinary Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHowever,it said:\u201dWe urge all the people taking part in the Ekiti state governorship to follow due process, conduct themselves with civility and patriotism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should not take the laws into their hands \u2013 no matter the grievances they may hold against individuals, against the state, or against electoral bodies or security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe NPC also wishes to announce that a peace accord will be signed by the various political parties and stakeholders on Wednesday, June 15, 2022, at the Amazing Grace Events Hall, Ikokun, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we call on our youths not to make themselves pawns in the political chessboard of the political class. The youths must realise that the security, stability, and future of Nigeria remains their common patrimony. They must make themselves available to become ambassadors of peace, retaining hope in Nigeria and support the democratic process in Ekiti state, and Nigeria in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies and the political candidates in the Ekiti State governorship elections should know that the eyes of Nigerians, and indeed the world, are on them. The conduct and peaceful outcome of the Ekiti State off-cycle elections will put to test all the claims of reforms and strategic policy implementations of the last four years\n\n\u201cWe expect that a level playing field should be provided for all contestants \u2013 irrespective of the party under which they are contesting.\n\n\u201d We call on INEC and the security agencies not only to be non-partisan in the discharge of their duties but also to be seen to be so. We equally call on INEC to ensure inclusivity, facilitating an electoral exercise where people do not in any way experience disenfranchisement as a result of their gender, religious or ethnic affiliations, and/or disability,\u201dit further said.\n\nThe committee also urged the contestants to \u201capproach the elections in a true spirit of sportsmanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge the media, including social media, to be alert to their responsibilities and eschew reportages that will further inflame passions (including forwarding sensational write-ups, fake news and \u2018alternative facts\u2019).\n\n\u201d In the final analysis, if Ekiti state is up in flames, we will all feel the heat \u2013 just like we will all partake in its peaceful dividends if we resolve to first and foremost vote for peace irrespective of our different political inclinations. Consequently, we urge all stakeholders to eschew violence rhetoric and actions before, during and after the election so that Ekiti State will emerge from the electoral process much stronger, living up to its name as the \u201cLand of Honour and Integrity\u201d, the statement further read.",

Fayemi spoke on Channels.\n\nThe Catholic Diocese in Owo said yesterday that the 40 victims of the attack will be buried on Friday. Those who could not be identified will be given mass burial.\n\nThe three-day mourning declared by the Southwest governors begun yesterday across the six states.\n\nThe Director of Social Communication of the Diocese of Ondo, Rev.

Since then, I have put my entire team to work on growing and improving the party, including raising the party\u2019s visibility on all media platforms, recruiting more than 10,000 new members to the party, and providing new offices for various state chapters of the party at my expense.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply regrettable that other inducements appear to have played more important roles in determining the outcome of the primary than loyalty to the party.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\nSeventeen of the 18 registered political parties have elected their candidates for next year\u2019s presidential election. One party, Action Peoples Party (APP), will not present a presidential candidate for the poll, as the time given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for political parties to conclude their primaries elapsed on June 9.\n\n\n\nWith the emergence of the presidential candidates for the February 2023 general election, the next stage is the choice of their running mates to make up complete tickets, as provided by the constitution.\n\nWhile the politicking for vice presidential candidates goes on, we familiarise Nigerians with the men, who want to lead the country, perhaps, to help the citizens in their choice of preferred candidates.\n\nTHISDAY presents the 17 men, who seek to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nChristopher Imumolen (AP)\n\nProfessor Christopher Imumolen is the presidential candidate of Accord Party (AP).

He is the founder of Global Wealth System, a business network system, with over 450,000 membership, set up to empower entrepreneurs globally.\n\n\n\nImumolen said he joined the 2023 presidential race because he believed Nigeria needed a new kind of leadership, since things were not working because there was a leadership gap.\n\nHamza Al Mustapha (AA)\n\nMaj. Hamza Al-Mustapha was Chief Security Officer to the late Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha. Al-Mustapha was trained as a military intelligence operative and held various command posts in the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Security Group of the Directorate of Military Intelligence (SG-DMI), 82 Division; Army Headquarters; Ministry of Defence; and the Presidency.

On January 30, 2012, the Lagos High Court found Al-Mustapha guilty of the murder and he was sentenced to death by hanging.

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, George Okoh in Makurdi, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe, James Sowole in Abeokuta, Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City, Fidelis David in Akure and Oluchi Chibuzor\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo, has charged Nigerians to embrace democracy with a view to strengthening national unity and building social cohesion.\n\n\n\nOsinbajo, who spoke yesterday at the Church Service to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day, in Abuja, declared that, \u201cdemocracy works because the values of justice, equality, fairness and inclusion, which underpin democratic governance, are also at the heart of our Christian faith\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cDemocracy works, all the more so in a heterogeneous union like ours, through negotiations and compromises carried out in good faith. And each year brings us closer to a more perfect union, a more mature democracy.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, said, the commemoration provided \u201copportunity to reflect on how far we have come as a people. It invites sobriety and gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to remember the decades characterised by a lack of freedom, suspicion and uncertainty, and calls to mind the prayers, faith and courageous actions that brought us to a turning point in 1999, one accompanied by hope and promise.\u201d\n\n\n\nQuoting copiously from the Holy Bible, the vice-president recalled how in Deuteronomy Chapter 16, \u201cGod commanded the people through Moses to \u201cObserve the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn Esther 9:20-22, following the great deliverance of the Jews from the devious plots of Haman, it says: \u2018Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far, to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd so in celebrating our Democracy Day, in-line with biblical and historical traditions, we assure ourselves that the hands of God are never too short to deliver and that His grace will always prevail for our good. Equally important, is that we also assure ourselves, that no matter how challenging the situation or moment might be, there is always enough God-given strength within us, as a people, to surmount them\u201d.\n\nOrtom Urges Nigerians to Rise against Anti-democratic Forces\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has urged Nigerians to be on the alert against anti-democratic forces, saying, \u201cWe must guard our democracy jealously.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy deliberate efforts and design, Nigerians opted for the presidential system of democracy, because it is participatory and representative enough. It is a way of life that must be held sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message to Nigerians to commemorate the June 12 struggle, Ortom recalled the tortuous journey to democratic rule and urged Nigerians to rise up to say, \u201cNever again shall we allow undemocratic forces take control of our collective destiny.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor, however, advocated the need to strengthen democratic institutions in the country \u201cso that the practice of democracy should not be at the dictates or the whims and caprices of a few individuals, who think they will lord it over the general public but the wishes of the people.\u201d\n\nYahaya Tasks Citizens on Active Participation in Electoral Process, Governance\n\nGombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, has enjoined the people of the state to continue to play their role in deepening democracy by actively participating in the electoral process, which he noted has improved over the years.\n\n\n\nIn a goodwill message, to mark the June 12 Democracy Day, which was issued by the Director-General (Press Affairs), Government House, Ismaila Uba Misilli, the governor noted that democracy has come to stay in the country, and called on the people of the state to get involved and remain steadfast as major stakeholders in the process of governance.\n\n\n\nHe also noted with delight the successful conduct of party congresses and primaries, calling on the people of the state to exhibit same maturity as the 2023 electioneering begins soon.\n\nWhile urging the citizenry to take advantage of the opportunity of the continuous voters\u2019 registration, especially, those just attaining voting age or those that had not registered previously, to obtain their PVCs, he said it would make them to be eligible to exercise their rights and contribute to nation-building.\n\nDiri: Leaders Must Be Servants\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, has said the essence of democracy would be lost if leaders failed to be servants to the people.\n\nDiri made the remark yesterday while speaking at a non-denominational Democracy Day service at the King of Glory Chapel, Government House, Yenagoa.\n\n\n\nThe governor charged those occupying elective and appointive offices to see themselves as servants while the people that gave them the mandate as their masters to whom they were accountable.\n\nA press release by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as saying that elected or appointed officials should regard such positions of authority as a privilege and a platform to better the lot of the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday being Democracy Day, we should all be reminded to continue to give service to our people. If you have been elected or appointed into key government offices and positions, you should note that It is only but a privilege.\n\n\u201cIn all our actions, we should know that those who have given us the mandate to serve them are our masters and we are their servants. If you make yourselves a demi-god, you are only deceiving yourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nSoludo: Democracy is Struggle for Better Society\n\nGovernor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has described democracy as a continuous struggle for better society.\n\nSoludo, who spoke during a special mass at the Anambra Governor\u2019s Lodge in Amawbia, in celebration of Democracy Day, stated that it was not only so in Nigeria, but all over the world, as democracy was the only form of government that could guarantee a better society.\n\n\n\nSoludo said: \u201cNation building is a consequence of struggle for class, both social and otherwise, and values such as focus, determination and perseverance are indispensable in this kind of struggle. There is no perfect society anywhere in the world, however, contestations and contradictions bring out the best in the society.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as Nigeria celebrates Democracy Day, the sacrifices by the late MKO Abiola and others, in the course of the struggle that gave rise to the Democracy Day celebration will not be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe governor said for Anambra, democracy would remain a struggle to build a livable and prosperous homeland, where every one would feel safe in, noting that everybody had very fundamental role to play in bringing it to fruition.\n\nZulum: Defying Boko Haram for 13 Years Makes Northeast Hero of 23-Year Democracy\n\nPeople of the northeast, particularly, those in Borno State, have spent more than half of Nigeria\u2019s 23 years of uninterrupted democracy, showing \u201cincredible resilience\u201d against vicious attempts by Boko Haram insurgents to undermine democratic institutions, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum said yesterday.\n\n\n\nZulum, who is Chairman of the Northeast Governors\u2019 Forum, conveyed these in his Democracy Day message, made public by his spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, where he described the people of Borno State and rest of the northeast as deserving of being amongst heroes of Nigeria\u2019s 23 years of sustained democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is now 23 uninterrupted years since Nigeria returned to democratic rule back in 1999. In those 23 years, societies across the country have witnessed different levels of progress and challenges.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn those 23 years, the people of Borno State and other parts of the northeast, have since July 2009, ceaselessly resisted groups of extremely violent insurgents with the determination to wreck massive havoc on communities, pursuing the ultimate objective of bringing down democratic institutions in Nigeria, and replacing them with violent sovereign doctrines.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn these 13 years, countless number of these citizens as members of \u2018Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes, have made sacrifices including giving their lives at battle fronts, to protect fellow citizens and to preserve our nation\u2019s sovereignty and democracy. These fallen volunteers alongside those currently in front lines and all citizens of the northeast eminently qualify to be named amongst the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s 23 years of uninterrupted democracy.\u201d\n\nOwie: Those Who Annulled June 12 Election Acted in Bad Fate\n\nFormer Senate Chief Whip, Senator Roland Owie, has said members of the Military Council, that ordered the annulment of June 12, 1993 Presidential election, were under the control of evil spirit.\n\nOwie, who made the declaration in a statement yesterday, in Benin City, Edo State, stated that, \u201cThe annulment was to tell the world that those who are evil won\u2019t go unpunished. Whatever we sow, we will reap. Therefore, celebrating June 12, is the celebration of \u2018retributive justice\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeloved, whatever we do in this world we should always remember that there is God! There is Heaven!! There is Hell!!! June 12 Election was a retributive event on the wicked, for The word of God says: \u201cEvil shall slay the wicked: And they that hate the righteous shall be desolate\u201d (Ps.34.v.21).\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that June 12, 1993, was an event with which The Almighty God showed that all powers belonged to Him. \u201cThat event showed that God heard the prayers of our great leaders, amongst whom are, late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, Alhaji Adamu Ciroma, Gen. Shehu Musa Yaradua, and millions of Nigerians, who were betrayed at various times by the principal actors and their collaborators, who were to be the major beneficiaries of the success of that election of JUNE.12\u2033.\n\nAbiodun Reverses Death Sentence on Six Convicts, Frees 40 Inmates\n\nAs part of activities commemorating the 2023 Democracy Day, Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has approved the committal of six convicts on death row to life imprisonment and also released 40 inmates.\n\nThe governor made the pronouncement yesterday while speaking at the June 12 Commemorative Anniversary and Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, held at the M.K.O International Stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the committal to life imprisonment and release of the convicted inmates was in accordance with the provisions of Sections 212 (1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended) and Sections 4 and 5 of the Ogun State Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy (Establishment Law), Laws of Ogun State 2006.\n\n\n\nAbiodun, who called on Nigerians to draw strength from the 1993 general election and make the 2023 exercise even better, equally advocated stringent punishment for violators of due process in elections, declaring that people\u2019s ballots must count and be respected in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe governor noted that the struggles of June 12 as orchestrated by late MKO Abiola, gave birth to the seamless democracy Nigeria has enjoyed in the last 23 years, emphasising that \u201conly by upholding the tenets of democracy and ensuring its sustainability that we can truly honour the memory of those ideals that Chief MKO Abiola and others stood and died for.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu: We Must Join Hands to Build the Future We Want\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the commemoration of another June 12 occasion must come with a deep reflection of the progress recorded so far in the nation\u2019s democratic experiment, while joining efforts to correct the imperfections yet to be addressed to make the system of government worthwhile.\n\n\n\nThe governor, in a statement to mark Democracy Day yesterday, said June 12 remained a rallying symbol around which Nigerians\u2019 aspirations for unity, hope, better condition of living and true democratic practices were built, including the hope of creating a better country.\n\nSanwo-Olu said such hopes must be rekindled by the sacrifices made by past political actors that laid down their lives, especially, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, who paid supreme price.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe challenge before all of us today, as Lagosians and Nigerians, is that June 12 must become a symbol of unity, of hope, of aspiration for a better tomorrow, one built upon true democratic ideals and practices. The Democracy Day must be a reminder of the importance of joining hands to build the future we want. Twenty-nine years ago on this day, Nigerians trooped enthusiastically to the polls, defying stereotypes of ethnicity and religion to prove to ourselves and the world that a new Nigeria is possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the powers-that-be at the time truncated that dream. But it was merely a delay, not a denial. We have since been blessed with a new opportunity to build on the hope and the potential of June 12, 1993. That responsibility is now in our hands, and posterity will not forgive us if we squander it. We have seen our democracy at work. It is not perfect, but no democracy is. There are still gaps to be closed, and processes to be improved upon, but there is no doubt that the journey we started over two decades ago is fully on course and maturing.\u201d\n\n\n\nGet Your PVCs, Saraki Tells Nigerians\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has called on Nigerians across the nation to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement by his Media Office in Abuja in commemoration of Democracy Day, Saraki, acknowledged the sacrifice of Nigeria\u2019s past heroes, who have contributed to the development of the nation\u2019s democracy, and called on all Nigerians of voting age to ensure that they exercise their civic duty by voting next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs families across Nigeria settle in to commemorate the significance of #DemocracyDay, we all must remember the immeasurable sacrifice of our heroes, as well as celebrate the courage, and persistence of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis is because, throughout this oft-imperfect journey to institutionalise stronger democratic values in all aspects of our lives, there have been hiccups, yet, Nigerians have always demonstrated an unwavering commitment to forge a better, stronger, safer, and more prosperous nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this regard, as we observe today, remembering that the 2023 general election is just around the corner, I ask all Nigerians of voting age to ensure that they have their PVCs to exercise their civic responsibility by participating in the election of our leaders at the state and federal levels.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu: Democratic Values Must be Deepened, Canvasses Restructuring\n\nOndo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has identified restructuring as the only panacea for the array of challenges confronting the nation, particularly, insecurity.\n\nThe governor, in his June 12 message yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, said it was time to deepen the democratic values that the Democracy Day represented.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough we are still mourning, we will not forget to join our voices to address the fundamental issues that have remained a clog in the wheel of the country\u2019s progress. This day represents a watershed in the history of democracy in our country. It also symbolises a total rebirth of hope and aspiration. It reinforces not just an enduring hope, but resilience in the face of daunting challenges.\n\n\u201cToday, we must make efforts to ensure that the reason for this day is not defeated. Our focus must shift primarily to the people. We must identify the challenges confronting the nation and be prepared to tackle them for the overall benefit of Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt, our country is going through hard times. The issue of insecurity requires our collective efforts. We must renew our commitment to the protection of lives and property. Our country must explore all angles aimed at securing our space against these divisive elements bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration,\u201d Akeredolu said.\n\nHouse Minority Caucus Tasks Buhari on Credible Polls in 2023\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take very firm steps to put in place all necessary arrangements that will guarantee free, fair, credible and transparent general election in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, extolled the courage, selflessness and patriotism of Chief MKO Abiola, who made immense sacrifices and paid the supreme price for the entrenchment of democracy in the country.\n\n\n\nThey stressed that the federal government must use the occasion of the June 12 Democracy Day to commit to processes that would check electoral manipulations, guarantee the security of voters and ensure that only votes cast by Nigerians in their respective polling units counted at the end of the elections.\n\nThe lawmakers also urged leaders at all levels to uphold this legacy by carrying out their responsibilities in line with the demands of justice, equity, fairness and adherence to rules.\n\nDon\u2019t Despair, APC Will Soon Be History, PDP Urges Nigerians\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, urged Nigerians to use the occasion of the June 12 Democracy Day to reaffirm their determination to vote out the anti-democratic, inhumane, lawless and rudderless All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nThe party also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to go beyond his usual rhetoric and take practical steps to guarantee the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, reminded President Buhari that Nigerians were more than ever before, determined to fully entrench the democratic demands of credible elections, which was at the core of the Democracy Day celebration.\n\n\n\n\u201cJune 12 embodies the struggle by Nigerians against corrupt, suppressive and dictatorial forces, against lawless, insensitive, anti-people and terrorism-promoting regime, against injustice, high-handedness, recklessness and incurable impunity, all which the APC has come to represent.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unpardonable that the APC administration has arrogantly continued to violate and trample on the substance, value and quintessence of June 12 Democracy Day; the democratic principles of Constitutional Order, freedom, justice, fairness and equity as well as the much-desired national cohesion and tolerance which Chief MKO Abiola personified and died for.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposition party therefore called on the APC to stop testing the will of Nigerians with its continued abuse of process, violation of human rights, nepotism, electoral manipulations, stifling of freedom of speech, promotion of violence; the very pattern of the dark era of military dictatorship in our country, which Chief MKO Abiola fought against.\n\nUzodimma: June 12 Resonates Our Collective Struggle, Resilience to Enthrone Democracy\n\nImo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has congratulated Nigerians for keeping faith with democracy with June 12, noting that the day resonated the collective struggle and resilience of the people to enthrone and sustain democracy.\n\nIn his goodwill message, yesterday, he said one of the major takeaways about the Day is that the will of the people in a democracy was supreme and could not be underestimated.\n\n\n\nHe said the fact that Nigeria had experienced 23 years of uninterrupted civil rule spoke to the collective desire of the people to sustain democracy and congratulated them for the sacrifices they made to enthrone democracy.\n\nHe, however, challenged Nigerians to search their consciences whether, by their behaviour, they have truly internalised the spirit of June 12, even as he reiterated his resolve to sincerely serve the people of Imo State by providing services that would enhance their wellbeing, using his 3-R mantra of rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery.\n\nGroup Tasks Religious Leaders to Egg-on Members to Collect PVCs\n\n\n\nThe Pray Nigeria Movement (PNM), has called on religious leaders across the country to encourage their members to go and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).\n\n\n\nBut as the race to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari gathers momentum, it spoke of the need for Nigerians to seek spiritual insight as to who becomes the next President at the forthcoming general election.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Lagos, recently, PNM convener, Prophet Isaiah Wealth, said Nigerians must pray for their country always, adding that, their forthcoming June 12 Fast programme, was a vision for the movement to pray for the emergence of a good leader that would usher the country into a new dawn.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Pray Nigeria Movement is not a political organisation, and it has no political motivation or affiliation. PNM was born out of the passion to bring Nigeria to its destiny apart from political means.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* National power grid collapses again as Discos apologise\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nConsumers desperate for relief from the scourge of sky-high petrol prices won\u2019t get it soon, if the latest forecast from Goldman Sachs commodity analysts is anything to go by.\n\n\n\nIn an update to their outlook for oil prices over the next 12-18 months, the team at Goldman warned that they now expect oil prices, measured by the Brent crude international benchmark to rise to nearly $140 a barrel as early as the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nThe prediction came just as the national electricity grid in Nigeria collapsed again yesterday, even as a handful of power Distribution Companies (Discos) apologised to the customers in their various franchise areas.\n\n\n\nThe price of oil and gas has already surged more than 50 per cent so far this year, driving up the average price of goods and services and causing inflation in many parts of the world.\n\n\n\nIn Nigeria for instance, the price of cooking gas also known as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) has soared by over 100 per cent in the last one year while the prices of diesel, jet fuel and kerosene have skyrocketed, increasing by as much as 200 per cent in some cases.\n\n\n\nBut for petrol, Nigeria has continued to subsidise the product, which generally still sells for \u20a6165 per litre nationwide, although it could more than double that price without the payment of what the government terms under-recovery.\n\n\n\nThis year alone, the federal government is paying roughly 25 per cent of the entire year\u2019s budget on subsidies after it deferred its removal by about 18 months, citing its expected negative impact on the poor as the reason.\n\n\n\nDespite the growing international price of oil, Nigeria has been unable to take advantage because it\u2019s not able to produce the quota allocated to it by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\n\n\nIn addition, the country does not refine a drop of the products it consumes and therefore spends its scarce foreign exchange to import the products amid a weakening dollar/naira environment.\n\n\n\nOther countries of the world also affected negatively by the soaring fuel prices include the United States, for instance, which has now hit a record of nearly $5 a gallon as oil futures for both Brent and WTI crude were trading near $120 a barrel at the end of the week.\n\n\n\nAlthough the longest global oil supply deficit on record ended in April after nearly two years, the Goldman team said it expects a resurgence in Chinese demand will more than offset the surprising durability of Russian crude exports.\n\n\n\n\u201cOil\u2019s structural deficit therefore remains unresolved, with in fact an even tighter oil market through April than we had expected. Supply remains inelastic to higher prices,\u201d the Goldman team wrote.\n\n\n\nMajor oil producers have limited capacity to ramp production further in the near term and those that do have the spare capacity will likely be hesitant to fully use it due to a lack of exemptions from OPEC+ drilling quotas, the Goldman Sachs group said.\n\n\n\nWhile OPEC+ agreed during its June meeting to boost production, members\u2019 ability to aggressively accelerate drilling faces several challenges.\n\n\n\nOne is that drilling activity has languished at half of its level from the first quarter of 2020 for the past 18 months, and any surge in production would likely take months to implement. Another is the lack of an exemption for Russia from its OPEC+ quota at the June meeting.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Goldman team, this would suggest that the few OPEC+ members who have capacity to spare won\u2019t be allowed to compensate for the looming jump in demand from China.\n\n\n\nThe lack of sufficient spare capacity represents a binding constraint for OPEC+ members trying to pick up the slack as Europe turns away from Russian crude, a report by Market Watch stated, noting that energy stocks will continue to outperform expectations.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year, the price of Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark oil briefly hit a record $139 and has since remained above $100, a development rarely experienced in the international oil market.\n\nNational Power Grid Collapses Again as Discos Apologise\n\nMeanwhile, he national electricity grid collapsed again yesterday, even as a handful of power Discos apologised to the customers in their various franchise areas.\n\n\n\nPower distributors across the country, including the Eko, Kaduna and Abuja companies in messages sent to consumers, said they had not been able to receive bulk electricity from the national suppliers.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the latest incident was about the fourth publicly announced collapse in recent times and occurred at about 6.49pm, again throwing the nation into total darkness.\n\n\n\nThe Abuja Disco which oversees Abuja, Kogi, Nasarawa and Niger states, however appealed to its customers for understanding as it was working with stakeholders to fix the problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that the current power outage is due to a system failure from the national grid. The system collapsed at about 6.49 pm today 12th June, 2022, causing the outage currently being experienced.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal for your understanding as all stakeholders are working hard to restore normal supply,\u201d it stated.\n\nOn its part, Kaduna Disco also attributed the blackout to lack of supply, assuring its customers that power would be restored as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that the power outage being experienced in our franchise states is due to system collapse of the national grid.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe collapse occurred at about 18:47 pm this evening hence the loss of supply on all our outgoing feeders. Power supply shall be restored as soon as the national grid is powered back,\u201d it said.\n\nAlso, Eko Disco stated that it regretted the inconvenience to its customers, asking them to bear with the company as the issues were being sorted out.\n\n\u201cDear Esteemed Customers, we regret to inform you of the on going system collapse on the National grid. This has affected our entire network and impacted our ability to deliver optimum service.\n\n\u201cPlease bear with us as we are working with our Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) partners on a swift resolution,\u201d it stated.\n\nAlthough there was no official communication from the TCN, it was learnt that the system was yet to pick up load as at 11 pm.\n\nPower supply in the country has always been erratic in Nigeria, although it has gone worse in recent times, with hope waning as to whether the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration will be able to make any marked difference in the remaining months.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "text": "A point of sale (POS) agent identified as Oluwakorede Noah has raised the alarm over the refusal of Crowd Force, a distribution network, to address complaints of failed financial transactions for over a month.\n\n\n\nNoah told SaharaReporters that his POS business has recorded losses running into N250, 000 because of the company's refusal to contact the bank and trace unsuccessful transactions.\n\nAccording to Noah, he was introduced to the company's product, PayForce and had been an agent on the platform. However, he started observing malfunctions in the machine as customers\u2019 accounts get debited and his own wallet was not credited.\n\n\n\nHe said the machine complicates the issue by noting that the transaction had been approved which increases the impatience of the customer who had already been debited. However, Noah said he had only recorded losses as this amount does not get credited to his own account (wallet).\n\n\n\nHe said efforts made to ensure the company resolves the dispense error issues had proved abortive, adding that he only had about N9,000 left to run his business.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI have been working with PayForce as a POS agent. We started noticing N1 dispense error on every transaction from them and we didn't notice it early enough until someone told us how to check it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was one transaction that happened N80,200; the whole money just disappeared. There was no money in our wallet and the customer had been debited. I reached out to them through several messages; they would ask me to input my username, sponsor, etc. but funnily enough, my sponsor (field agent) has not been reachable since January.\n\n\n\n\"If you call him, he'll tell you he's in the bank, etc. Now the guy is nowhere to be found, they have no office here in Lagos.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother thing is the other contact they shared with us said he resigned from the company in February and they kept sending his number to us to call him. The guy said he had already left for another job and that he could send his resignation letter to me if I didn\u2019t mind, I informed the company about this, and then they said their regional manager would reach out to me.\n\n\n\n\u201cTill now, as I speak, the entire loss is in the range of N250, 000. They told me they would send N5,000 to one of my customers but I felt; how does that have anything to do with me?\n\n\n\n\u201cI am a graduate but ventured into POS business to take care of my family but now they want to swindle me, they asked me to go to the bank. How can I go to the bank for a transaction that had been done? They should be the ones to go to the bank.\n\n\n\n\"As I speak now, we don't have the cash to run the business because everything we have invested is gone. We have only N9,000. It's like there's someone at their bank end that is stealing from customers. They have refused to rectify the problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey keep telling us not to give customers money if we are not sure. How am I supposed to do that when the machine is defective? When you do a transaction, it's supposed to approve it. When it approves, it is supposed to credit the wallet. But now, it won't credit and approve, sometimes it won't show anything and the customer is desperate. When you tell them that they'll get a reversal, only a few of them understand.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I'm asking Payforce to do is help us identify these people. There's a way they can approach the bank for such.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want the world to know that dispense error issues do not occur through the POS operator, it is a symptom of a failing or a faulty system. Hence with immediate effect, I hereby call on relevant regulatory agents of the government to help us look into this issue of systematic pilfering.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen SaharaReporters contacted CrowdForce, the company's representative identified simply as Mariam confirmed that Noah had lodged a series of complaints about failed transactions.\n\n\n\nThe representative further explained that it is not the duty of the company on behalf of the agent except Noah can present evidence of the physical cash given.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe treat declined transactions within 24 to 48 hours; this is because when a transaction occurs, we don't get reports until the day after. What we always tell our agents is that whenever there's a failed transaction, they should hold on for 24 hours before we can get a resolution.\n\n\u201cIt is only until then that we can state if the transaction is settled to us, then we can go ahead to pay but in a case where there is a declined transaction and the money was not settled to PayForce by the customer's bank, there is no way we will be able to make payments.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn Mr Noah's case, he had a series of declined transactions, some of which were settled to us which he was funded for and then he had others which were not settled to us which he was not funded for and he complained about it.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe paid his customers by receiving the credit from our end, that was what caused the loss on his part. We usually tell our agents that in the event that PayForce is not settled for a transaction, it means the customer's bank did not remit the funds to us. Hence if there is a debit, the customer should go to their bank and fill a dispense error form to get a reversal but in this case, he went ahead to pay without speaking to the customer service representative to find out the status of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we are not settled for a transaction, we cannot lay claims to it. We have asked Mr Noah to tell his customers to go to the bank for a reversal. We cannot go to the bank to lodge a complaint on Mr Noah's behalf because for withdrawal transactions like this, we cannot tender proof of payment at the bank. It's just by word of mouth. He's telling us he made payment to these customers. We don't have physical evidence to tender to the bank.\"",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s controversial \u201cICT Practitioners Bill\u201d is closer to becoming law",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Kenya\u2019s 12th parliament passed the controversial 2020 proposal that seeks to regulate \u201canyone who employs technologies to collect, process, store or transfer information for a fee\u201d.\n\nFirst introduced in 2016 by majority leader, Aden Duale, and supported by Kenyan MP, Godfrey Osotsi, the wide-sweeping and vague ICT Practitioners Bill mandated the registration and licensing of vaguely defined \u201cICT practitioners\u201d by a council. According to the 2016 proposal, individuals who sought registration with the council needed to have completed a university education with at least 3 years of relevant experience and would pay an annual license fee. The proposal also outlined jail terms and fines for individuals who failed to comply.\n\nA snapshot of the amended 2020 bill. The full bill is here.\n\nNeedless to say, the proposal drew an outcry from the country\u2019s tech community and was reportedly withdrawn after Joseph Mucheru, Cabinet Secretary in Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Information and Computer Technology, rejected it, noting that proposals in the bill would affect innovative talent and alienate local youth from lucrative online jobs, educational and investment opportunities. At the time, Mucheru had said, \u201cIf enacted, the ICT Protection Bill 2016 will cause duplication in regulation and frustrate individual talents from realising their potential.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2016.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, a member of parliament who was nominated to represent workers, Godfrey Osotsi, reintroduced the bill with an amendment that simply loosened the eligibility requirement for ICT professionals. Now instead of being required to have graduated from a university, a proposed ICT Practitioners Council would determine who got registered.\n\nIn 2018, the bill was also rejected.\n\nAgain, 2 years later in November 2020, the bill was reintroduced with superficial amendments that removed degree requirements, jail terms, and fines for people who fail to register.\n\nAlmost 2 years later, this Wednesday in a sleepy parliamentary session, and with one day to go before the 12th parliament closed shop for the term, the bill was quietly passed and now awaits presidential assent.\n\nWho is supporting this bill?\n\nWhile the bill has generated outrage from stakeholders in Kenya\u2019s tech community, there is significant support from a raft of tech professionals. In 2016, the Secretary-General of the ICT Association of Kenya (ICTAK), Kamotho Njenga, released a statement supporting the bill. \u201cOnce enacted,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201cthe various provisions enlisted will go a long way not only to elevate the standards of ICT practice in Kenya but to also avail a blueprint that will help counter multiple challenges that accompany emergent technologies. By creating a registration framework, the bill injects professionalism and introduces a culture of accountability within the industry as the country gears towards an ICT-driven economy.\u201d\n\nPaul Macharia, a health informatics consultant supports the proposal. \u201cHaving worked in the ICT space for over 15 years, I know we needed a regulatory body like yesterday.\u201d he opined. He says the bill will ensure standards of competence, allow governments to keep a register of all the professionals that meet these standards and deal with the professionals that fall short of these standards.\n\nBoth Macharia and the ICTAK\u2019s points are the standard arguments of the proponents of the bill. But Kenya already has a Computer Misuse Act and a Cyber Crimes Act\u2014both wide-sweeping laws that regulate the use of technology in Kenya, so it is not clear how or why another law is needed to stop the so-called quacks from operating. Besides this, the bill does not disclose how the council would issue accreditation for ICT professionals or provide the criteria to be used in determining if an individual is of good moral standing.\n\nThat \u201cquack\u201d classification is also problematic. Information technology is one of the most dynamic and fast-growing spaces globally. Unlike civil engineering or medical health, for example, a software developer does not need to be certified to build software. Indeed many of today\u2019s widely used tech products are built and maintained by unlicensed developers. No country has the sort of national ICT licensing programme that this bill proposes.\n\nBut Macharia contends that Kenya can lead the way, \u201cSure! Kenya being the first is a great thing,\u201d he wrote in a LinkedIn comment. \u201cWe could set the pace/standard on how ICT professionals work.\u201d\n\nA black spot for Silicon Savannah\n\nKenya\u2019s Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 depends on strong performance from its burgeoning ICT sector. Photo by Mustafa Omar on Unsplash\n\nA loose alignment of tech stakeholders and professionals who have been fighting the bill since its debut in 2016 disagree.\n\nIn a draft counter-statement to the ICTAK\u2019s 2016 declaration seen by this writer, the group wrote, \u201cRegistering of practitioners does not necessarily lead to professionalism and accountability. ICTAK has not cited any direct evidence that registering of practitioners affects the overall quality of services provided to customers by members of a regulated profession.\u201d\n\nThe statement continues, \u201cAlmost every ICT job is conducted within the confines of \u201ccontracts\u201d that define the responsibilities of parties involved, hence ensuring accountability. What values shall this bill add to the accountability of ICT practitioners, that is beyond the scope of contracts we sign today as we go about our duties?\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d\u2026 gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem.\n\nMembers of the group also organised a petition which garnered over 14,000 votes at the time and succeeded in getting the bill withdrawn twice. But the almost comical and steady 2-year-gap-march of the bill appears to have won out\u2014at least in parliament.\n\nStakeholders now fear a presidential assent on the bill could seal what has been described as rent-seeking behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I think the bill is detrimental is that innovation is about thinking outside the box,\u201d Sheena Raikundalia, Director of UK-Kenya Tech Hub told TechCabal, \u201cit\u2019s not about your degree or paper certificates. Some of the best techies I know are self-taught! Tech moves so fast, [that] by the time you finish your degree what you learnt is outdated. This is taking a step back.\u201d\n\nAffectionately described as Africa\u2019s Silicon Savannah, Kenya is one of the Big Four technology heavyweights in Africa. As recently as last month, Microsoft and Google set up new offices in Nairobi, global card payment association, Visa announced that it had opened an innovation hub\u2014one of only 6 in the world, and Amazon announced plans to open an Amazon Web Services (AWS) local zone in the country. These are all a significant testament to the East African nation\u2019s tech reputation which also ranks 4th on the list of African countries with the most professional developers only behind Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt.\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d. But in a heating tech talent market, poorly thought out regulation that looks, to all intents, like pure gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem. Right now Kenya is distracted by its upcoming national elections, and reports of social media-fueled hate speech and misinformation are increasing. Those are important areas for regulation; deciding who is qualified to build a mobile app is not.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Tijan Watt is building a pan-African VC from Dakar",
          "text": "On a windy Thursday evening, in April, a delegation of investors, startup founders, and journalists gathered at the Port of Dakar waiting for the Chaloupe de Gor\u00e9e, a formidable ferry that could hold as many as 340 people, to transport them to the historic Gor\u00e9e Island, where Wuri Ventures, a Dakar-based pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, was hosting its launch party.\n\nAway from the high-end restaurants and 5-star hotels\u2019 seaside bars in Dakar\u2019s city centre where most other events of this nature took place, 45-year-old Tijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Venture, had spefically chosen this Gor\u00e9e Island, which used to be the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d during the Transatlantic Slave Trade, to introduce his firm to the world.\n\nWatt towered over almost everybody else on the chaloupe in a white, Guinea-fabric shirt and black jeans. Even though his beard had nearly gone a solid grey, he was still full of energy, and his eyes were as ambitious as they probably were 21 years ago when he first moved back to Senegal.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWuri Venture is not a new establishment; it\u2019s more than 3 years old. It was first conceptualised through an early advisory business called African Tech Leaders that Watt had founded to advise startups in the process of fundraising and seeking entry into global accelerators like Y Combinator. But Watt told TechCabal that in 2018, he realised advisory alone wasn\u2019t enough to scale the ecosystem, and the idea to start investing in early-stage startups was born. He joined forces with Jerome Cretegny, a seasoned investment professional leading the Senegalese operation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the time. The two combined their personal funds and used that to back promising African founders. In 2019, they incorporated Wuri Ventures, and within a year, the duo made 6 investments.\n\nWatt said that to realise their pan-African ambition, they needed more funds. So they sold 7.5% equity from their general partner equity, bringing 15 top tech and finance operators into the venture. They also partnered with Capria Ventures, which provided Wuri with the credit line it needed to invest, and eventually led to a $1.5 million investment in South Africa\u2019s Whereismytransport $14.5 million series A extension round before the partnership was discontinued. After that, the firm launched a subscription model so that they could pool funds from local and international individual investors\u2014angels, endowment funds, family offices, etc.\u2014using the Angellist Venture platform (It\u2019s the same platform Nigeria\u2019s Future Africa and Kenya\u2019s Mutua Venture use to power their subscription angel investing models.)\n\nA delegation of investors, startup founders, tech operators and journalists admiring and taking pictures of the historical Gor\u00e9e island as the chaloupe approaches the island.\n\nHowever in January this year, Carry1st, a mobile game publishing company Wuri Venture invested in at a very early stage and at a $4 million valuation, closed a $20 million series A extension round from a16z and Google at a valuation of $100 million. This single deal returned double of all the 6 deals they had made over the years. So Wuri exited so that it could be liquid enough to fund other deals.\n\n\u201cWe made some good returns and exited so that we can continue supporting other early stage startups,\u201d Watt told TechCabal.\n\nEven prior to the official launch in April, Wuri Ventures has advised more than 20 startups and invested $2 million across 14 deals including Carry1st, Whereismytransport, Lori Systems, Kotani Pay, Tambua Health, Norebase, Nestocoin and Caytu Robotics amongst others. The firm continues to invest alongside global investment leaders such as a16z, Google, Toyota Tshusho, Avenir Growth and others. Now, Watt believes that its subscription model is going to help ramp up their investment figure from $2 million to $4 million within a year.\n\nWuri Venture also provides incubating programs for founders to learn the ropes of the startup world. Caytu Robotics, one of such startups that incubated with Wuri, recently displayed one of its robots, an Autonomous Delivery Robot, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where it was remotely controlled from Dakar\u20146,000 km away from Boston where MIT is located.\n\nFrom Wall Street to selling sugar in Dakar\n\nWatt was born to a Senegalese father and an African American mother. He grew up in Washington, DC where he attended Sidwell Friends School, a prestigious institution that counts Chelsea Clinton and Sasha and Malia Obama among its esteemed alumni. Watt went on to study mathematics and computer science at Howard University, a historically black college.\n\nAfter a brief foray into science, running lab tests on both humans and animals, Watt spent 3 years as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in New York and London, and in 2001 he decided to move to Senegal.\n\nEven though the dotcom boom had shown signs of bursting in 2000, it didn\u2019t, and the cool kids of Wall Street were still dumping their six-figure salaries to embrace the promise of the digital revolution. Even though Watt saw his colleagues moving to companies like Priceline, he devised a plan instead to move to Africa and become a dotcom pioneer there. How difficult could that be?\n\nTijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Ventures, stands on a makeshift podium to address the guests at the launch event.\n\nIn reality, Watt had only visited Senegal once when he was 18 and knew close to nothing about the landscape. He started to abandon one startup idea after the other: he first wanted to become an internet service provider (ISP) but the \u201cexisting player had a massive capital warchest to kill him on arrival,\u201d he giggled as he narrated this part. After spending a year playing with ideas, he started his own flavoured sugar company in 2002. The company was called Crystal, a name he claimed was inspired by a Notorious BIG song\u2014and that\u2019s how he waltzed off the track of his dotcom ambition.\n\nLike his earlier ISP idea, the Senegalese sugar industry was dominated by The Mimran Group, a French, family-owned company. The Mimran Group owns the Compagnie Sucri\u00e8re S\u00e9n\u00e9galaise (CSS) which cultivates 8,000 hectares of sugarcane in Senegal, and has more than 5,000 employees during harvest time\u2014the largest employer in Senegal after the country\u2019s government. To understand how much money this family made from sugar consumption in Senegal as far back as the 1980s, in 1981, they paid $3 million to acquire Lamborghini and saved the Italian fast car company from bankruptcy. Then they sold it to Chrysler Corporation in 1987 after expanding its model line of product from 1 to 3 in the space of 6 years.\n\n\u201cMy thought then was: since everyone in the country consumes sugar, it\u2019s essentially like a tax on the population,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd then that should not be held in the hands of a single person or that single family.\u201d So at 26, the ambitious Watt took on the Mimran empire.\n\nWatt would build the business into a household name employing nearly 100 people and achieving revenues of $15 million. In the grand scheme of things, that didn\u2019t harm the Mimran\u2019s dominance, but Watt believes that it created a new narrative. \u201cThere is a lot of value in Africa and it\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s the foreigners who are capturing most of it. To some extent, we changed that\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years running the company as CEO, building processes and structure, Watt left to pursue an MBA at Harvard. After that, he worked as an investment officer at Nigeria\u2019s Travant Capital in Lagos, where he stayed for 2 years before returning to Senegal to run Crystal in 2009. Seven years after, Watt finally exited Crystal and moved to Ethiopia to work as the chief revenue officer of mFino, a fintech company providing banks and telcos with mobile banking solutions in major markets in Africa including Ethiopia, Nigeria and Senegal.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "With less than a year to the end of the current government, an appraisal of the Nigerian economy using a mix of metrics shows that the country is worse off now than when President Muhammadu Buhari took over seven years ago.\n\nFor this reason, stakeholders have said it is not going to be business as usual for the next president as the country grapples with high inflation rate, high unemployment rate, insecurity, dwindling purchasing power of households, high cost of raw materials, and naira depreciation.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s posture from the outset was to address corruption, insecurity and improve the standard of living of Nigerians. In the last ranking by the Mo Ibrahim Index, the Nigerian economy was classified as \u201cincreasing deterioration\u201d.\n\nThe analysis of the Nigerian economy was carried out using the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2021, Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index (TI) 2021, Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance 2020 and the Human Development Index (HDI) 2020, and all point to the same conclusion.\n\nThe MPI evaluates acute multidimensional poverty, by comparing socio-economic progress being made in more than 100 developing countries. It measures the extent of deprivation individuals suffer based on 10 indicators in three equally weighted categories, including healthcare, education and the standard of living.\n\nAccording to the University of Oxford, multidimensional poverty means poor health, lack of education, inadequate living standards, disempowerment, poor quality of work, the threat of violence, and living in areas that are environmentally hazardous.\n\nWhen split further, the above three broad indicators include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance and cooking fuel. Others are sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. MPI values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating higher multidimensional poverty.\n\nNigeria\u2019s MPI was derived from the country\u2019s demographic and health surveys conducted between 2015 and 2020, and collated from a sample size of 90,919 individuals. And based on the assessment, Nigeria\u2019s MPI score was 0.254 in 2021. A low score such as Nigeria\u2019s indicates a very high level of multidimensional poverty. The number of poor Nigerians has been predicted to reach 95 million by the end of 2022, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe MPI further showed that Nigeria\u2019s intensity of deprivation was 54.8 percent, while 26.8 percent of Nigerians were in severe multidimensional poverty. Another set of Nigerians, 19.2 percent, were vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.\n\nOn what could have caused the high poverty intensity in the country, the report attributed 78.3 percent of Nigeria\u2019s multidimensional poverty to challenges people encountered while accessing healthcare and education as well as the declining standard of living.\n\nThe Nigerian Medical Association recently said over 9,000 medical doctors left Nigeria in search of greener pastures in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada in the last two years.\n\nInaccessible quality healthcare caused 19.2 percent of the nation\u2019s multidimensional poverty, 30.9 percent was caused by inadequate education, and 28.2 percent by the declining standard of living.\n\nTI\u2019s Corruption Perception Index put President Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption drive under close scrutiny, because Nigeria has not fared well in the ranking in the last few years. Nigeria ranked 136th in 2015, having scored 26. It was ranked 144th in 2018 with a score of 27, while in 2021, it scored 24 and was ranked 154th in the world. A score of 100 signifies that the country is very clean while zero indicates a very corrupt country.\n\nThe number of high profile corruption cases uncovered in the last few years will leave no one in doubt about the TI rankings for Nigeria. Just recently, the country\u2019s accountant-general was suspended for allegedly diverting over N100 billion; Ibrahim Magu, the former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was removed from office after he was accused of diverting recovered funds and seized assets, while the former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission was arrested over a fraud allegation running into N47 billion.\n\nThe Mo Ibrahim corroborates the aforementioned indexes. Nigeria\u2019s overall ranking in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance deteriorated between 2015 and 2019. From 48.9 in 2015 to 48.4 in 2016, it declined further to 46.7 in 2017 and 46.6 in 2018. The worst grade was in 2019 when the country got 45.5.\n\n\u201cTI rating on corruption is a perception of how corrupt a system is. With the consistent low rating of the country, Nigeria is perceived to be corrupt. It can also mean that the system that was put in place to check corrupt practices is not effective,\u201d Moses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nHe said there had been an improvement in the HDI for Nigeria over time, from 0.465 in 2005 to 0.539 in 2019.\n\n\u201cHowever, the nation is still ranked among the low human development nations. This speaks to the fact that there has been a low level of investment in soft infrastructures such as healthcare and education or there is no impact of the meagre spending on soft infrastructures,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ojo, with low life expectancy, high level of poverty, and declining purchasing power, it is expected that the HDI of the country will be low, impacting the contribution of the affected populace to the economic output.\n\nRead also: Just imagine Atiku or Tinubu as president\n\nHow Atiku, Tinubu will be different\n\nPositive sentiment trailed the quick release of the economic agendas of the leading presidential candidates, as this is expected to raise the level of engagement with the electorate and give room for the scrutiny of their programmes before the general elections in 2023.\n\nAtiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu, flagbearers of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party and the ruling All Progressives Congress unveiled their economic agendas on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMany options are available to them to revive the economy. On the monetary side, the CBN needs to control inflation and float the naira. On the fiscal side, government needs to reduce its size, resolve the insecurity, deregulate the energy and power sectors,\u201d Abiola Gbemisola, an investment analyst with FBNQuest Merchant Bank, said.\n\nBoth presidential candidates favour a market economy. This is why stakeholders believe they will depart from President Buhari\u2019s style of economic management.\n\nAnnouncing his economic agenda few days ago, Atiku anchored his programmes on three principles, which are reaffirming the critical sector of private leadership and greater private sector participation, repositioning the public sector for better service delivery, and enabling appropriate legal framework for rapid economy and social development.\n\n\u201cI will allow the market greater leverage in determining the prices; this way we shall eliminate the persistent price distortions occasioned by current interventionist exchange rate management policy. Government interventions, where absolutely necessary, will be done responsibly and judiciously,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu\u2019s economic programmes will focus on job creation, value-addition in manufacturing and the revival of infrastructures in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, if elected as the next president, he would focus on stimulating jobs, get Nigeria to work by launching a major public works programme, with significant and heavy investment being channelled into infrastructure, and value-adding manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nHe would anchor his growth plan for the economy on the establishment of sub-regional industrial hubs to exploit each zone\u2019s competitive advantage and optimise their potential for industrial growth.\n\n\u201cMy administration will build an efficient, fast-growing, and well-diversified emerging economy with a real GDP growth averaging 12 percent annually for the next four years, translating into millions of new jobs during this period,\u201d Tinubu said.",

Government interventions, where absolutely necessary, will be done responsibly and judiciously,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu\u2019s economic programmes will focus on job creation, value-addition in manufacturing and the revival of infrastructures in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, if elected as the next president, he would focus on stimulating jobs, get Nigeria to work by launching a major public works programme, with significant and heavy investment being channelled into infrastructure, and value-adding manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nHe would anchor his growth plan for the economy on the establishment of sub-regional industrial hubs to exploit each zone\u2019s competitive advantage and optimise their potential for industrial growth.\n\n\u201cMy administration will build an efficient, fast-growing, and well-diversified emerging economy with a real GDP growth averaging 12 percent annually for the next four years, translating into millions of new jobs during this period,\u201d Tinubu said.",

          "text": "The leading political parties in Nigeria have all now named flagbearers for next February\u2019s crucial presidential election and the focus is shifting back to the country\u2019s fragile economy and the daily struggle of the people and businesses in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nMany Nigerians believe that economic matters and rising insecurity will shape the outcome of the election, which may witness a huge jump in the number of youths voting as data from the current voter registration across the country suggest.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy, the continent\u2019s biggest, is continuing to struggle, with the outgoing president and his cabinet unable or unwilling to take painful but needed decisions to reverse the economic collapse. The finance minister recently said oil earnings were barely able to pay for petrol imports but she offered no new initiatives to improve the dire financial position of the country.\n\nNigeria has shelved plans to tap the market for a $950 million Eurobond as international bond yields rise and the nation\u2019s local currency continues its puzzling downward spiral amid surging oil prices. This will mean more domestic borrowing that has traditionally crowded out the private sector.\n\nThe $950 million issuances from Nigeria would have been the last international bond from the 2021 budget after the authorities issued $1.25 billion in March this year.\n\nThe foreign reserve position of Africa\u2019s top oil producer fell the most in near 20 months in May, according to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nVirtually every set of data from official sources points to Nigeria\u2019s weakening external position. The National Bureau of Statistics recently released trade and capital importation data for the first quarter of 2022, with capital importation in the quarter falling a whopping 28 percent quarter on quarter to $1.5bn.\n\nThe impact of the trade balance turned positive in Q1 does pale into insignificance when compared with the consecutive negative data for the two quarters before it.\n\nNigeria\u2019s external position remains fragile despite the favourable increase in oil prices. Foreign reserves stand at $38bn, the lowest since October 2021 and the naira exchange rate as well as the growing margins show the battle for a stable exchange rate is far from being won, and it would appear the monetary authorities have run out of options.\n\nSpeaking at the monthly breakfast of the Lagos Business School recently, leading economist Bismarck Rewane, who is a member of the president\u2019s Economic Advisory Council, said to expect inflation to spike further to 17.5 percent in June on the back of rising core and seasonal inflation and a 200-300 basis points rise in money rates. He added that diesel price would touch N750 a litre in June, the local currency would fall further on the parallel market while the equities market is expected to trade flat in the month before dipping.\n\nRead also: The numbers that show outsized role of oil in Nigeria\u2019s economy\n\nData show that it is not just on the economic front that Nigeria is losing pace. Rankings of the country by Transparency international corruption perceptions, the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance and the Global Peace Index point to continuing slippage. The average indicates a marked fall since the outgoing government in Nigeria came to power in 2015.\n\nAs Nigeria prepares for the election, the dire insecurity situation is getting even worse. On June 5, over 40 persons were mowed down in a hail of gunshots inside the church where they were worshipping in the southwestern town of Owo. The incident has caused consternation among Nigerians who now expect the insecurity to continue to spread to areas in the South hitherto thought to be safe.\n\nTellimer research note says, \u201cThere has been limited progress, if not outright backsliding, on outgoing President Buhari\u2019s promises to fix the security and corruption problems with Nigeria continuing to rank very poorly on global peace and corruption scorecards during his tenure, increasing pressure on the ruling APC ahead of the February elections.\u201d\n\nThe only ray of hope is coming from the expectation among Nigerians that the leading candidates for next year\u2019s presidential election will mount market-friendly economic policies.\n\nPositive sentiments are emerging from how Nigerians perceive the economic agenda of the main candidates for next year\u2019s election with the candidate of the ruling party indicating a shift away from the controversial policies of the incumbent including full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry.\n\nThe main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the ruling party, and Peter Obi of the Labour Party are expected to open the economy by mounting a string of economic reforms that will rejuvenate key areas of the economy if they win the election.\n\nOutgoing President Muhammadu Buhari has maintained a strangulating hold on the economy, leading to gasps and rising poverty, which may see Nigerians turning away from the ruling party in the upcoming elections.\n\n\u201cTiti Omobude is an analyst\u201d",

The peculiar circumstance the nation finds herself calls for reflection in the decisions we take, so long as they bother on our national lives.\n\n\u201cToday, the country is deeply divided within our fault lines of ethnicity and religion and we cannot afford to jettison this sensibility in critical decision making.\n\n\u201cThis is why we think that the All Progressives Congress must be guided by the sense of these sensibilities in the selection of the Vice Presidential Candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nAudu said that to do otherwise would be to further fuel what divides the masses and give room for mischief makers to take advantage of our differences.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria is in dire need of good governance, which can come from either a Muslim leader or a Christian leader.\n\nHe also noted that while some interests wanted the north to pick the ticket so as to put the contest between two northerners, others advocated for the All Progressives Congress to pick her flag bearer from the south in the spirit of nationalism, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cBut in the spirit of nationalism, justice and fairness which the northern governors demonstrated a few days ago, the leaders of the north on whose shoulder the emergence of the Vice Presidential candidate rests must also demonstrate this spirit by ensuring that the candidate comes from the Christian faith.\n\n\u201cThe northern APC has in its fold capable individuals from the Christian faith with proven track record that can deliver just like anyone from the other faith.\n\n\u201cTheir capability to deliver on the ideals of the party aside, they also have the capacity to win elections for the party. Suffice to add that no individual wins elections for any political party, it is the collective of all and we are sure the APC can achieve this,\u201d he urged.",

I have resigned because the process and conduct of the party\u2019s presidential primary on June 8, 2022 at Abeokuta revealed a fundamental clash of values between me and your leadership of the party,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cDespite the circular you issued a few days to the primary committing the party to providing transportation and accommodation for delegates to and in Abeokuta, and which as we agreed would provide a level playing for all the presidential aspirants, the party under your leadership failed to do so.\n\n\u201cSome aspirants, including myself, made donations to the ADC party account as requested by the party for this purpose. This failure, which appeared intentional, created room for massive abuses of the electoral process including delegate capture and financial inducement of delegates.\n\n\u201cThis is only one of numerous inconsistencies and the absence of transparency and predictability in the management of the party that I had progressively complained about.\n\n\u201cAs you are well aware, I have consistently resisted pressures to join the APC or the PDP precisely to avoid \u201ccash-and-carry\u201d politics. For me to remain a member of the ADC therefore, after what thousands of party members participated in at Abeokuta, would be to endorse political corruption of a most obscene order.\n\n\u201cI joined the ADC in October 2021 with the best of intentions. Since then, I have put my entire team to work on growing and improving the party, including raising the party\u2019s visibility on all media platforms, recruiting more than 10,000 new members to the party, and providing new offices for various state chapters of the party at my expense.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply regrettable that other inducements appear to have played more important roles in determining the outcome of the primary than loyalty to the party.\u201d",

I have resigned because the process and conduct of the party\u2019s presidential primary on June 8, 2022 at Abeokuta revealed a fundamental clash of values between me and your leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cDespite the circular you issued a few days to the primary committing the party to providing transportation and accommodation for delegates to and in Abeokuta, and which as we agreed would provide a level playing ground for all the presidential aspirants, the party under your leadership failed to do so.\n\n\u201cSome aspirants, including myself, made donations to the ADC party account as requested by the party for this purpose. This failure, which appeared intentional, created room for massive abuses of the electoral process including delegate capture and financial inducement of delegates.\u201d\n\nMoghalu noted that that was only one of numerous inconsistencies and the absence of transparency and predictability in the management of the party that he had progressively complained about.\n\n\u201cAs you are well aware, I have consistently resisted pressures to join the APC or the PDP precisely to avoid \u2018cash-and-carry\u2019.\n\n\u201cFor me to remain a member of the ADC therefore, after what thousands of party members participated in at Abeokuta, would be to endorse political corruption of a most obscene order.\n\n\u201cI joined the ADC in October 2021 with the best of intentions. Since then, I have put my entire team to work on growing and improving the party, including raising the party\u2019s visibility on all media platforms, recruiting more than 10,000 new members to the party, and providing new offices for various state chapters of the party at my expense.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply regrettable that other inducements appear to have played more important roles in determining the outcome of the primary than loyalty to the party,\u201d he said, adding that only God knows the plans for his future in Nigeria\u2019s politics.",

You were all deceived. You can\u2019t be in corruption and fight corruption. The most corrupt regime in the history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou heard of the Accountant General. N80 billion, all they need to get the universities up and running is less than N80 billion.\n\n\u201cAre they interested? Their children are not there. God has risen, and the land shall be liberated. The nation shall be rescued in the name of Jesus,\u201d he said.\n\nOyedepo declared that the reign of terror, oppression, insecurity and wickedness is over in Nigeria\n\nOn the church in Nigeria, he declared that anyone who attempted to destroy it shall be grounded to powder. \u201cThe Church of Christ in Nigeria is unstoppable; anyone that stands in the way shall dry up from the roots. The Church of Christ in Nigeria is unmolestable. He that touches the church, touches the apple of God\u2019s eyes and must be ready to see God\u2019s red eyes. \u201cThe peace of God shall continue to reign in Nigeria. There shall be no more bloodshed in this nation. Hypocrites shall no longer reign in Nigeria. Nigeria shall not be destroyed. We shall not see war in Nigeria. The destiny of our great nation, Nigeria, shall be gloriously restored,\u201d Oyedepo declared.\n\nThe fiery preacher lamented that \u201cthe first time I saw a church leader with a cutlass on his neck and he was killed on video. No arrest made, wicked government, evil government. A little girl was asked how she passed this exam, \u201cJesus helped me\u201d. For saying that, they burnt her in this nation. They shall be burnt to ashes.\n\n\u201cThough He bore long with them, the evil continued, so judgment must stop it today. I have never seen wickedness displayed like under this wicked government. The most wicked this nation has ever experienced. Wicked from head to toe.\n\n\u201cCursed be every Fulani bandit in Nigeria. We are not serving a dummy God, within 24 hours He will show up. They went to Church and killed fifty people who came to church to worship, including a couple that got married the Saturday before. Their generation perishes, both the agents and their sponsors.

          "text": "It wasn\u2019t for the fun of it that the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, is called the stabilizer, amongst top government functionaries. It was in recognition of his deft political experience and administrative skills, to ensuring that structures are consciously put in place, and allowing process to take its course on every occasion.\n\nAlthough for reasons that some thought was tenable and politically expedient, the former handlers of the presidency were generally considered high-handed, and rather than create a friendly administration, even for insiders to have a sense of belonging, the stories from the corridor of power were not as palatable as many would have desired.\n\nUnfortunately, life happened and Mustapha, by providence, began to handle all manners of assignments for his principal, the president, and by extension, became the unofficial manager of the presidency, an assignment he has so far discharged to the awe of even the enemies of the government and the opposition alike.\n\nTherefore, for a man, who understands the presidency and the office of the president so well, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, needs not look further in picking that suitable ally with whom he would run the government and make real change to happen.\n\nInterestingly, the two men come from sound political backgrounds and their trajectory had shared space from time to time, in the onerous task of actualising the Nigerian dream.\n\nA Christian northerner with requisite education and exposure, complemented by very expensive contacts, Mustapha, an enviable family man, comes highly recommended as the ideal pair to sell the APC joint ticket, if the ruling party must leave Nigeria in completely safe hands.\n\nThe SGF ventured into politics in the 1980s after his graduation from the law school. And between 1988 and 1989, he was already a member of the Constituent Assembly, the body that drafted the Constitution of the Third Republic, which further came handy as the nation progressed in her political and democratic sojourn.\n\nIn 1989, he was the Chairman of the Peoples Solidarity Party (PSP) in defunct Gongola State. Sadly, the party fell on the sword of the military junta at the time and was among the political parties disbanded by then Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nAs life went on, Mustapha, between 1990 and 1991, became the chairman of Adamawa State wing of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), one of the two political parties created by the Babangida regime. He contested for Adamawa State governorship in 1991 as the SDP candidate, but lost to the National Republican Convention (NRC) candidate, Abubakar Saleh Michika.\n\nMustapha was a member of the presidential committee set up by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2000, to investigate the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), under General Muhammadu Buhari, after he had earlier resigned his position as Executive Chairman of the agency.\n\nThe Interim Management Committee, however, did its work but the report was never made public.\n\nAs he progressed in life, Mustapha served as the Deputy Director-General to the presidential campaign of then Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, during the 2007 presidential election.\n\nAs the Deputy National Chairman of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the party that was among the three major ones, fused into the APC at the February 6, 2013 merger, ahead of the 2015 general election, Mustapha was instrumental at different stages, especially, in the area of strategy, to the formation of the ruling party, until victory was assured in the 2015 elections.\n\nHe later served on the presidential campaigns and was among the members of the transition committee in the 2015 election that, brought Buhari into power. He is also a member of the board of trustees of the party and at some point, headed the Inland Water Ways, after Buhari had become president.\n\nWithout a doubt, Mustapha, has all it takes to be Nigeria\u2019s vice-president, particularly, given his personae, maturity, experience, name recognition and carriage, for the office of the number two citizen. He understands the literature of high wire politics, including its rudimentary nuances, and knows as much, the processes in government.\n\nLet\u2019s think about it, there couldn\u2019t have been a better match for Mustapha amongst the lot. He is the right man for the job. And curiously, Tinubu knows as much \u2013 that Mustapha is dependable, trustworthy and hardworking. What more, a South West/North East pairing is a winning balance any day, any time.",

          "text": "UK campaigners on Monday failed in a last-gasp bid to stop the government\u2019s first flight of asylum seekers to Rwanda, as protests mounted against the policy.\n\nThree judges at the Court of Appeal in London rejected a challenge to a High Court ruling last Friday that the deportations could go ahead.\n\nJudges Rabinder Singh, Ingrid Simler and Jeremy Stuart-Smith dismissed claims the lower court judge should have waited to make a decision until a full hearing on the legality of the policy next month.\n\n\u201cHe weighed all the factors and reached a conclusion which he was reasonably entitled to reach on the material before him,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201cThis court cannot therefore interfere with that conclusion.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: In Britain, LGBTQ Migrants Fear Being Sent To Rwanda\n\nThe government has vowed to push ahead with the removal of the migrants on a chartered flight on Tuesday from an undisclosed airport.\n\nThirty-one migrants had been due to be sent but one of the claimants, the NGO Care4Calais, tweeted that 21 of them had now had their tickets cancelled.\n\nOther claimants include the Public and Commercial Services union, whose members will have to implement the removals and immigration support group Detention Action.\n\nPCS chief Mark Serwotka said on Sunday it would be \u201can appalling situation\u201d if Tuesday\u2019s removals were subsequently found to be illegal at the full hearing.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel should wait for the July hearing if she \u201chad any respect, not just for the desperate people who come to this country, but for the workers she employs\u201d, Serwotka told Sky News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely confident that in July, in line with what the UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) said very graphically in court, we believe these proposals will be found to be unlawful.\u201d\n\nProtesters gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday and further demonstrations were expected outside the Home Office.\n\nIn Geneva, UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi called the UK government policy \u201call wrong\u201d and said it should not be \u201cexporting its responsibility to another country\u201d.\n\n\u2018Hate speech and discrimination\u2019\n\nPatel and Prime Minister Boris Johnson insist the policy is needed to stop a flood of all-too-often deadly migrant crossings of the Channel from France.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the criminal gangs who are putting people\u2019s lives at risk in the Channel understand that their business model is going to be broken,\u201d Johnson told LBC radio on Monday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re selling people falsely, luring them into something that is extremely risky and criminal.\u201d\n\nUnder the agreement with Kigali, anyone landing in the UK illegally is liable to be given a one-way ticket for processing and resettlement in Rwanda.\n\nThe government says that the plan will target gangsters who charge would-be migrants thousands of dollars to undertake the perilous crossing for a new life in Britain.\n\nGenuine asylum claimants should be content to stay in France, it says.\n\nAnd contradicting the UNHCR, it insists that Rwanda is a safe destination with the capacity to absorb possibly tens of thousands of UK-bound claimants in future.\n\nFor now, the deportations will proceed \u201con a gradual basis\u201d, Doris Uwicyeza, chief technical adviser to Rwanda\u2019s justice ministry, told LBC radio.\n\nUwicyeza pushed back at criticism over the human rights record of President Paul Kagame\u2019s government \u2014 which is set this month to host a Commonwealth summit attended by Prince Charles and Johnson.\n\nRwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide made it particularly attentive to \u201cprotecting anybody from hate speech and discrimination\u201d, including gay people, she said.\n\nRwanda\u2019s High Commissioner to Britain, Johnston Busingye, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that Rwanda would be a \u201csafe haven\u201d for migrants.\n\nBut British critics are unconvinced.\n\nThey include Prince Charles who dubbed the plan \u201cappalling\u201d, according to The Times newspaper on Saturday.\n\nThe reported comment prompted unnamed cabinet ministers to tell Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s heir to stay out of politics.\n\nInternational NGO Human Rights Watch issued a public letter warning that \u201cto this day, serious human rights abuses continue to occur in Rwanda, including repression of free speech, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture\u201d.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "In only his second competitive match in charge of Nigeria, 62 \u2013year old Portuguese Jos\u00e9 Santos Peseiro led the Super Eagles to wallop the National Team of Sao Tome and Principe 10-0 in a 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in the Moroccan city of Agadir on Monday, in the process obliterating Nigeria\u2019s 63 \u2013year old international scoring record. Peseiro himself was not born when the Nigeria National Team, then known as Red Devils, defeated Dahomey (former name of Benin Republic) 10-1 in a Kwame Nkrumah Cup match in Lagos on 28th November 1959.\n\nVictor Osimhen, who also scored the winner against Sierra Leone in Abuja on Thursday, scored four of the goals, starting his account with a powerful header that goalkeeper Anastacio Braganca could not just stop in the 9th minute. As early as the second minute, Osimhen, always fully charged, had flicked the ball with his head from a Zaidu Sanusi pull-out, but there was no Eagle to connect.\n\nIn the 19th minute, Terem Moffi\u2019s shot was saved by Braganca as Nigeria dominated easily and with much efficiency, and four minutes later, a good Osimhen header from Ademola Lookman\u2019s corner was again saved by Braganca.\n\nIn the 28th minute, defender Ola Aina\u2019s pull-out found Osihmen, who laid for Moses Simon to tap beyond the flailing hands of Braganca for Nigeria\u2019s second. Four minutes later, Sao Tome and Principe had their first shot at Francis Uzoho\u2019s goal, but Luis Leal\u2019s effort went off target.\n\nMoffi wasted two excellent opportunities to take Nigeria higher on the scoreline, in the 36th amd 40th minute, but did just that in the 43rd minute when he beat two defenders to slam into the net from a great Osimhen pass.\n\nIn the secong half, it was all Nigeria. Osimhen\u2019s firm header from pull-out by Lookman in the 48th minute went in for the fourth goal, and seven minutes later, Oghenekaro Etebo fired his 20 \u2013yard free-kick into the underside of the bar and into the net for Nigeria\u2019s fifth. Osimhen thought he had scored a sixth for Nigeria in the 57th minute, but it was ruled off-side.\n\nOn the hour mark, substitute Ahmed Musa, only two minutes on the pitch, found an onrushing Sanusi whose cross found Terem Moffi well-placed to slam the ball into the net for Nigeria\u2019s sixth. It was Moffi\u2019s first goal for the Super Eagles.\n\nThree minutes later, there was another first. Ademola Lookman found the roof of the net after another Musa pass found Moffi and he chipped over onrushing goalie Braganca. It was Lookman\u2019s first goal for Nigeria.\n\nOsimhen, ever too much to handle, got his hat-trick in the 65th minute when laid on by a sweet Ahmed Musa pass, and in the 84th minute, another brilliant Musa pass found Osimhen in the right place to score his fourth and Nigeria\u2019s ninth.\n\nSubstitute Emmanuel Dennis won and converted a penalty kick on the dot of 90 minutes to round up a goal-spangled afternoon for Nigeria in Morocco\u2019s southern coastal city.\n\nThe Super Eagles\u2019 next games in the qualification are against Guinea-Bissau home and away in September.",

Kyalami would join the new Las Vegas Grand Prix, set to take place over Thanksgiving weekend, and the Qatar Grand Prix, which has signed a 10-year deal to host races.\n\nThe Chinese Grand Prix also has a contract to host a race in 2023 but the status of that event remains uncertain due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOf the races which will make way, the French Grand Prix looks unlikely to continue beyond this year\u2019s event at Paul Ricard.

          "text": "As the world marks another World Blood Donor Day on June 14, a day set aside to create global sensitisation on the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion as well as the vital contribution which voluntary blood donors make to the health systems of their countries, the founder of Jela\u2019s Development Initiatives(JDI), a nongovernmental organisation, Angela Ochu-Baiye has urged Nigerians to adopt J Blood Match, an Artificial Intelligence powered platform which seamlessly connects unpaid blood donors with those in need of blood to survive.\n\nOchu-baiye gave the charge on the sidelines of blood donation sensitisation activities organised by JDI for this year\u2019s World Blood Donor Day, WBDD. She said J Blood Match, launched on November 21, 2019, by JDI, is an effective platform that easily connects those in need of blood with voluntary, unpaid donors at no cost.\n\nWith this AI system, the NGO is innovatively building a strong blood donor network that is accessible through platforms such as Facebook and Telegram. \u201cThe AI processes requests from recipients in government verified hospitals. It\u2019s free. All you need do is to access it on the Facebook or Telegram apps and register\u201d, she stated.\n\nOn this year\u2019s WBDD, the Mandela Washington Fellow asserted: \u201cBeyond being a civic duty for me, blood donation requires a heart for humanity. An understanding that donating a unit of blood from your body, which you have now but would deplete in three months because fresh blood cells are generated from your system, is essentially for me not losing our humanity.\n\n\u201cMore so, donating blood means that you are keeping your true blood sister or brother\u2019s heart beating because they stay alive and as a result of your donation, their heart beats on.\n\n\u201cWe are all connected irrespective of our locations and when we allow J blood Match connect us to our blood sisters or brothers in need, we are fulfilling our civic duty and in turn keeping the world beating\u201d.\n\nCalling for support and partnerships with relevant stakeholders in the health sector for extensive awareness campaign for the system, Ochu-Baiye hinted that she plans to expand the application of J Blood Match AI to other neighbouring African nations but wants it to gain popular adoption in Nigeria first.\n\nThe J Blood Match AI is integrated into Facebook and Telegram and uses Artificial Intelligence to collect donor data such as gender, location, age, contact and blood group, which now make up the donor profile. When one is in need of blood, you simply go to the platform, register with the same data, including the needed blood group, to build a profile. The AI then scans through the system and finds a match who is closest to you, depending on available donor data.\n\nThe slogan for this year\u2019s World Blood Donor Day is \u201cDonating blood is an act of solidarity. Join the effort and save lives\u201d, and it is targeted at drawing attention to the roles that unpaid, voluntary blood donations play in saving lives and enhancing solidarity within communities.",
