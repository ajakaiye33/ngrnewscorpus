Wade decision that allowed abortions performed before a fetus would be viable outside the womb \u2013 between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 was wrongly decided because the U.S. Constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights.\n\nThe ruling means that individual states now have the power to decide on whether to ban abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group, has said that 26 states are \u2018certain or likely\u2019 to ban abortion now.\n\nThe decision means that women with unwanted pregnancies in large swathes of America will now face the choice of traveling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available, buying abortion pills online or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion.",

Honestly, I am surprised at large number of people coming out because I did not believe this large number had not registered because we have been in our office registering people since June last year.\n\n\u2018\u2018The surge is beyond our imagination. So far, we have done 10000 persons. WE are ending the registration at this centre tomorrow, we do not know if they are going to continue in other centres. We initially deployed 30 machines and later increased it to 87 machines based on demand.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe advised Nigerians to always take advantage of online portal opened by INEC to transfer, request and update details of their PVCs.\n\nOn the projected number of new registration for the general elections, Olagunju said the Commission is projecting about 94 million voters, a 10 million increase from the previous 84 million figure used for the 2019 general election.\n\nMeanwhile, the INEC has said there is no extension of registration exercise from the 30 June earlier announced.\n\nRecall that the National Assembly had requested that the closing date for the registration exercise be extended to enable eligible Nigerians get their PVCs for the elections.",

          "text": "Hunger looms, as drought hits Kano rice farmers\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu\n\nFOLLOWING the kidnap of 20 Abuja farmers on Thursday, the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, AFAN, Friday, warned that it will be difficult for Nigerians to feed themselves if nothing is done to protect farmers across the country.\n\nSpeaking with Saturday Vanguard, the National President, AFAN, Arc Kabir Ibrahim, said the plight of farmers, especially in the rural areas has assumed a dangerous dimension, and that food production would be on the lowest ebb in 2022, and would degenerate to starvation triggering more crime if nothing urgent and proactive is done as lasting solution to arrest the situation both at the local, State and federal levels.\n\nIbrahim lamented that a lot still lies ahead to tackle food security as farmers have used their blood to sacrifice for Nigerians not to fall into the valley of serious starvation, who quietly feed over 200 million mouths on daily basis.\n\nHe said even at frightening insecurity they still put their lives on the line to go to their farms to cultivate and harvest produce for Nigerians to eat.\n\nHe said these unsung heroes and heroines deserve to be protected, pampered, and honoured publicly.\n\nThe 22 farmers were on their farm working at a village called Rafin-Daji in Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, around 2pm on Thursday, when armed bandits kidnapped them, after shooting sporadically to an unknown destination, while one of the farmers escaped by the whiskers.\n\nMeanwhile, the FCT Command of the Nigerian Police Force has moved into the forest to rescue the kidnapped farmers as they go after their abductors.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is very discouraging to the farmers to work assiduously to feed the teeming population of our country when their comrades are kidnapped all over the place.\n\n\u201cUnless proactive action is taken to protect the farmers as they work to produce optimally to bring about food sufficiency it will be very difficult for Nigerians to feed themselves this year.\n\n\u201cAbuja has not been one of the regions prone to these attacks but it is now evident that it is also not spared.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the AFAN boss called for decisive action to \u201cstem the tide of incessant kidnapping and banditry if Nigeria is to be food secure if at all.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Biodun Busari\n\nVice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has said the Southern region did not pinpoint a sub-region that should produce President in 2023 before his emergence as a running mate to PDP presidential flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nHe added that both the North-East and South-East are in agitations of Presidency as two regions yet to produce a President in this democratic dispensation.\n\nOkowa said these to react to the condemnation of his vice-presidential emergence by the three major Southern groups describing his action as \u201cbetrayal of the highest order.\u201d\n\nRecall that the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), on Friday, condemned Delta State governor for accepting his nomination.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by leaders of four groups which include Chief Edwin Clark, for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF); Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, Dr. Dru Bitrus, the President-General, Middle Belt Forum and Prof. George Obiozor, the President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide.\n\nReacting in Channels TV Politics Today programme on Thursday, Okowa also said he will not argue with the group comprising elders as they are entitled to their opinions.\n\nHe also affirmed that he is an Igbo man but only from Delta State.\n\nOkowa said, \u201cFirst, I want to appreciate the elders for the comments they have made. There\u2019s no doubts that they are entitled to their opinions that they have rendered to our people. I do not want to join issues with our elders because they will have reasons for making the comments they have made counting on the information that was available to them at that particular point in time.\n\n\u201cIn the first instance, I\u2019m Ifeanyi and there\u2019s no doubt that I\u2019m an Igbo man. I\u2019m an Igbo man in Delta State, in South-South geo-political zone. Secondly, there is no doubt that the South-East has a right of agitation and as the South-East has a right of agitation, the North-East has also continued to make claims to the Presidency because from the records available, both the North-East and South-East have not been able to go ahead and produce a President in this country as at today.\u201d\n\nThe governor said, \u201cThe Northeast feels they are entitled to presidency, the Southeast feels they are entitled to presidency, and both are right. If when we were talking about the issues of the Presidency, even PANDEF, not even PANDEF of the Middle Belt, Afenifere of the southwest and Ohanaeze in the collective voice insisted that it must be from the southeast.\n\n\u201cBut the real truth is that they were just asking for a southern presidency without trying to situate it where ordinarily it should be. So, also are those who are also asking for presidency in the North have one reason or the other. If you ask question too, they will tell you since 1999 in the number of years till 2023, the South has more presidency than the north. People have opinions and the tendencies are different. The tendencies are different depending on the argument you are bringing in.\n\n\u201cBut, as at today, the real truth is that the North-East and South-East have continued to lay claims it is their turn to have the presidency and I think that those claims are not wrong. They are obviously not wrong. But under the circumstance we find ourselves as vice-presidential candidate of the former President, Atiku Abubakar who is from the Northeast in our convention, that have situated by God\u2019s grace when we win in 2023 to the Northeast.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Miftaudeen Raji\n\nAfter two years of intense hostility, former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode and his ex-beauty queen wife Precious Chikwendu have finally settled their rift.\n\nThe controversial couples resumed a renewed marital relationship on Saturday after a long-running marital crisis which broke out in 2020 and followed by legal battles.\n\nIn the heat of the crisis, Precious was docked in a Federal High Court (FHC), Abuja for the attempted murder of her then former husband, Fani-Kayode following charges of attempted culpable homicide, before Justice Inyang Ekwo.\n\nPrecious and three others, were charged for alleged attempt to stab Fani-Kayode with a kitchen knife on Nov. 24, 2018, at Asokoro, within the court jurisdiction.\n\nOthers arraigned alongside Precious include Emmanuel Anakan, Prisca Chikwendu and Osakwe Azubuike as 1st, 3rd and 4th defendants respectively, while others are said to be at large.\n\nIn a 13-count charge dated and filed on Jan. 7, the defendants were also alleged to have committed offenses bordering on cybercrime, intimidation to kill Fani-Kayode by use of the Internet, threat to kill one Lauretta in order to cause her to leave her relationship with Fani-Kayode.\n\nBut surprisingly, on Thursday Fani-Kayode issued a statement, describing their reunion as a truly surreal and historical moment.\n\nFani-Kayode said: \u201cFor the first time in two years, totally unexpectedly and out of the blue, and after she took our sons Aragorn, Ragnar, Aiden, and Liam out for yet another beautiful outing, Mama Aragorn came to the house to visit with us.\n\n\u201cFor two years she and I had not seen or spoken to one another but on Saturday afternoon we spent no less than four hours together in which we talked, laughed, and shared some beautiful moments.\n\n\u201cIt was touching to see members of my household and staff receive her and, led by our first son Aragorn who held her tightly by the hand, usher her through the gates and into the compound as I watched in utter disbelief and surprise from the balcony.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cMoments earlier I had seen them walking down from the top of the road through the CCTV cameras and from the same balcony.\n\n\u201cIt was a small crowd, led by Aragorn and his mother. They walked slowly with radiant smiles and laughter whilst a convoy of cars followed them from behind.\n\n\u201cIt was the dramatic return of a great and beautiful queen who was simply resplendent and who shone as brightly as the morning star.\n\n\u201cThere are some moments that words cannot capture or express and this was one of them. After two long years of contentious silence and acrimonious separation, she graced us with her presence and came home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress chieftain further said, \u201cIt was joy all around to see the return of this great lioness. Every single one of the 60 people that live and work in our home was happy to see her and some even shed a few secret tears of joy.\n\n\u201cMama Aragorn displayed such courage, grace, dignity, and class. This was a moment that I shall cherish for many years. This was a triumph for all lovers of peace and sons and daughters of righteousness.\n\n\u201cThis was the day that the power of God was made manifest, that joy came to Zuma close, and that the Lion of Aso Drive roared in glory, victory, power, and strength.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment that proved beyond all reasonable doubt that patience, restraint, understanding and peace bring nothing but joy and blessings.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment when light overcame darkness and when the secret prayers of four handsome little Princes were answered.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment when love, mutual respect, truth, and mutual forgiveness triumphed and Satan was put to shame.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThanks for coming, Mama Aragorn. We love and appreciate you. Always did, always will. And though we have gone our separate ways the bond and cord that exists between us through our four beautiful boys can never be broken.\n\n\u201cI also offer my thanks to my loyal and faithful wife and a true Daughter of Zion, Mama Remi, and to Mama Folake, Mama Arwen, my beautiful daughters Folake and Remi, my son Nicholas and my entire family and household for their collective and unconditional love, understanding, resilience, loyalty, support, and patience.\n\n\u201cYou stood firm, strong, and bold and you kept encouraging me even through the raging storm and darkest moments. Love conquered all and saw us through and so it shall continue to be.\n\n\u201cFrom generation to generation our circle of love, our fellowship, our family, our children, and our loved ones shall rise and go from strength to strength.\n\n\u201cIn every situation and circumstance, we shall prevail and the God that we serve shall never forsake us.

The distribution of ITN has been completed in Katsina state but is currently ongoing in Delta and Kaduna states, while the programme is pending in the remaining five states.\n\nAddressing a media parley in Kaduna ahead of the flag-off of distribution of ITN in Kaduna State, a representative of the National Malaria Elimination Programme, Mr. Omo-Eboh Mamudu said, \u201cmalaria is the most common preventable public health problem in Nigeria, yet it takes a lethal toll on 97% of Nigerians especially children under the age of five and pregnant women.\n\n\u201cWe want to eradicate malaria in Nigeria.

Simultaneous household registration and distribution of nets will commence from the 7th -18th July 2022.

          "text": "The Federal Government yesterday disclosed that it sealed 358 pharmacies and patent medicine shops in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in four days.\n\nIt stated that the sealing of the pharmaceutical premises for various offences, including operating without registration, fake licenses, dispensing ethical products without the supervision of a pharmacist, poor storage and sanitation, etc, was in line with its mission to ensure that medicines consumed by Nigerians are safe, effective and of good quality as they transit from one level of the distribution chain to another.\n\nThe Registrar of the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria (PCN), Pharm Ibrahim Ahmed, who made this known in Abuja while addressing journalists, revealed that four patent medicine vendors have been arrested and are being prosecuted.\n\nHe further disclosed that since 2018 till date, its national enforcement team had visited more than thirty thousand pharmaceutical premises and sealed more than twenty thousand across the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe proliferation of unregistered medicine shops has remained a major obstacle in the actualization of the National Drug Distribution Guidelines (NDDG). Many of these premises involved in sale of medicines to the public do not have appropriate storage facilities thereby exposing medicines to harsh environmental factors like high temperature and humidity.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the current enforcement exercise in FCT (between Monday to Thursday this week), a total of five hundred and eighty four (584) premises were visited. This comprises one hundred and eighty five (185) Pharmacies and three hundred and ninety nine (399) Patent Medicine Shops.\n\n\u201cA total of three hundred and fifty eight (358) premises made up of ninety (90) Pharmacies and two hundred and sixty eight (268) Patent Medicine Shops were sealed for various offences, some of which include operating without registration with Pharmacists Council of Nigeria, failure to renew premises license, dispensing ethical products without the supervision of a pharmacist, poor storage and sanitary conditions among others, while five (5) Pharmacies and Patent Medicine Shops were issued compliance directives.\n\n\u201cFour patent medicine vendors were arrested. Three of them were arrested for breaking PCN seals and one for displaying fake patent medicines vendor licence in his shop.\n\n\u201cSince my assumption of duty as Registrar on 10 June 2022, I have taken a look at the entire operations of the PCN and I intend to strengthen the national enforcement team and also reposition the Pharmaceutical Inspection and Patent and Proprietary Medicines Vendors Committees in the states to enhance monitoring, inspection and enforcement nationwide. This current enforcement in FCT is part of this effort.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, efforts are ongoing to ensure that all medicine dealers in open drug markets in the country are relocated to Coordinated Wholesale Centres (CWCs) in line with the National Drug Distribution Guidelines.\u201d\n\nRegarding ensuring that foreign trained pharmacists coming into the country to practise are competent, Ahmed said: \u201cThe assessment of foreign trained pharmacists is supposed to be a source of concern for regulatory bodies. However, in PCN, we don\u2019t only wait for them, especially countries that bring in a lot of graduates from their schools down to Nigeria. We go to those countries; ensure that we assess the training in those institutions. Any institution that we are not satisfied with, we will not admit their student into our own programme.",

It also appeared that the same faith might have befallen the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, as he could not also make the list\n\nHowever, reacting to the development while appearing on a television political programme, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said the commission is not obliged to publish the name of candidates that did not emerge from validly conducted party primaries.\n\n\u201cIf a political party submits to the Independent National Electoral Commission the name of a candidate that did not emerge from party primaries or did not emerge from valid party primaries, the commission is not obligated to publish the name of such a candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye however clarified that the commission has not published the final list of validly nominated candidates, emphasising: \u201cthe final list of validly nominated candidates will be published by INEC on September 20, 2022. And that is for presidential and National Assembly candidates.\n\n\u201cWhat the commission has published, as of today, complies with Section 29(3) of the electoral act which says that the moment political parties comply with the provision of Section 29 (1) of the electoral act in terms of the submission of its validly nominated candidates, that the commission shall publish the personal particulars of such candidates in the constituencies where the candidates intend to contest election.\n\n\u201cIn other words, for instance, for a senatorial candidate, if a senatorial district covers four local governments, we will publish the personal particulars of such a candidate in the four local governments.\n\n\u201cSo that is exactly what we have done. And we published the personal particulars of candidates that emerged from valid party primaries. And that\u2019s what the law says we should do.\n\n\u201cSo, if the name of any candidate was not published, or if the personal particulars of any candidate was not published today, the implication is that such a candidate did not emerge from valid party primaries,\u201d Okoye quipped.",

          "text": "Founder of Household of God Church, Oregun, Lagos, Rev Chris Okotie has warned that Nigeria will collapse if he\u2019s not allowed to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. He said to avert a national catastrophe, he, Okotie would have to head an interim government.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the pop star-turned cleric said the current political system in Nigeria, including the National Assembly, state assemblies and other government structures must be dismantled, noting that an interim administration headed by him would then midwife a brand new political system for the country.\n\nWhat informed this strange talk about an interim government after Buhari that must be headed by you?\n\nWe are in a juncture in our political evolution that it becomes the logical and the next step to take. The presidential system of government that we have been operating for so many years now has failed woefully. We redefined democracy to be government of the party by the party for the party. To that extent, they excluded Nigerians from the entire process and that is why things have degenerated to the level that we see today. To bring democracy back to the people; to re-establish the parameters in which we operate as a federalism, to rekindle brotherhood, to avoid war, segregation, the interim government is the only next logical step to take.\n\nWhen Chief Afe Babalola recently called for an interim government, he received knocks from across the country. Don\u2019t you think Nigerians might stone you for calling for what some could be described as a \u2018civilian coup\u2019?\n\nNot at all. What I\u2019m proposing is inspiring a conversation in the country where all our people begin to talk about the problem that we face right now. When those conversations have been collated, I will send them as a transcript to the president and to the National Assembly so that they can energise the process that can lead to a transition, not from a regime to a regime, but from this regime to an interim government because Nigeria should be fixed.\n\nAs a lawyer, you know an interim government has no place in our constitution. So how do you implement this system?\n\nThat is what I have just told you. The legislators and the president are Nigerians. Man was not made for the law, but the law was made for man. If the will of the people is that we have problems in the nation today (it is very clear, go to the streets and ask people, there is disillusion everywhere, resentment, anger), and there is the need to do something very drastic for our sake. Democracy is the ascent of the people. If the people say this process is not working, we need to do something urgently; that is why the National Assembly is there. They will now make a law signed by the president for transition into an interim government so that Nigeria can be fixed. I don\u2019t think that there is any difficulty in that.\n\nHow do you think the National Assembly would agree to throw away their jobs and support an unconstitutional arrangement?\n\nI expect that that they are patriots. There comes a time when a man must prioritise the needs of other people than himself. They were sent there as representatives of the people; the government is representing the people. So, if you find out that there is a political system that is not practicable to bring harmony in our society, it is the responsibility of these people to rectify that situation; it is a patriotic duty. I believe that with the scenario we have in the country today where things are really dilapidated, there is enmity (these politicians play the card on religion and ethnicity), we are so polarised , balkanised, I feel that they must recognise that as the only solution and therefore will rise this time as patriots and do the right thing. There comes a time in the affairs of men when you recognise that if you do not do the right thing, it would be catastrophic and cataclysmic and therefore, as intelligent people, lovers of this country, I believe that they would be galvanised by the circumstances to rise to the occasion of this reality. I also believe that the president has been kept by God in the means of all the debilitating illness that he had so that he can do something to protect this country before he leaves, and I believe that this could be his greatest legacy.\n\nDon\u2019t you think a sovereign national conference would address these problems that you have identified?\n\nNo. It is impossible because no subsisting or extant government can give that kind of latitude. It is an interim government where you do not have political considerations that usually work against that which is conducive for harmony and the wellbeing of the people. It is an interim government that can do that because it has no political agenda of its own; it is a corrective mechanism to salvage the political process, otherwise there may be great catastrophe and calamity. That is why none of these confabs has succeeded because an existing political institution like government cannot take that kind of responsibility. That is why it is inevitable at the moment that we move with the interim government for the sake of the corporate existence of our nation.\n\nMany Nigerians would no doubt consider this interim proposition a joke\u2026\n\nNot at all! You can see the signs; you can see how divided Nigeria has become; how polarised we have become. The politicians themselves have divided our nation so that they can rule. But I\u2019m saying, as a patriot, it is my responsibility to proffer solutions. The interim government would correct all of these. For instance, our democracy has been hijacked by elitism, mysticism, Satanism. Our democracy is no longer government of the people by the people for the people. It is now, government of the party by the party for the party. It is an aberration, a terminological inexactitude. So, we need to come back to democracy. That is why I\u2019m saying that this interim government will give an opportunity to proffer a solution. It is what I call, Aborigine democracy. For instance, we don\u2019t need the legislature; we can eliminate the legislature from this tripartite system of government where you have the executive, judiciary and the legislature. So the legislature is totally unnecessary. We can take power and give it back to the people because what the legislature does is to run committees; participate in committees to discuss issues that are already in existence in our polity. You have the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASSU), etc. These are institutions that are already there, you should involve them in lawmaking instead of getting people who do not understand the mechanism or dynamics of situations that confront the Nigerian people.\n\nMy suggestion is eliminate the legislatures, give the power to these institutions so that when it comes to lawmaking, go to them; they are part of the people. It is what I call, the concept of gregarious socialisation, where lawyers binding with lawyers, doctors binding with doctors, journalists binding with journalists, market women binding with market women. They understand the realities within their own firmament. If you want to make a law on health, you don\u2019t go to senators, but you go to the NMA or the affiliate, they can tell you what is necessary in their society; they emerge from that society. In this way, the financial burden that this nation has been trying to maintain will be eliminated. I call it Government of National Reconciliation and Reconstruction.\n\nWhat do you mean by this system of \u2018elitism, mysticism and Satanism?\n\nThe elites belong to echelon politics. There are those people who have a certain intellectual capacity; they are trusted by their people and have deceived them along the way because they have been in kaput with the rich men, the Plutocrats, the oligarchs, the hegemonies and they come to their people and say, this is the direction because the culture of our people is to follow people we consider to be leaders. Many of them are technocrats who are politically inclined but they pretend that they are democrats, but they only represent their masters. I call it political ventriloquism (somebody who throws his voice at a distance). When they open their mouths to speak, you hear their masters\u2019 voice. They have systematically oppressed the Nigerian people, deceived the Nigerian people and established their own personal agenda for self aggrandizement. They are problem number one. Problem number two is mysticism. These are people who call themselves juggernauts; \u2018without me, nothing will happen.\u2019 They have acquired their money, acquired everything. I call it social irredentism, where everything belongs to me \u2013 I bought this, I bought that, I have everything, I have all the money stored somewhere for the day of reckoning. These ones must be demystified. Problem number three is the Satanism. These are the ones who bring chaos; if my party doesn\u2019t win there is a state of emergency and then there is chaos and there is anarchy. This is the tripartite coalition; diabolical coalition that has militated against the democracy of our nation. But that would end when we have a government that understands its responsibility. One of the things in this interim government is that we would no longer have political parties. It is not necessary. In the definition of democracy, you will never find any reference to political parties mentioned. Political parties were engendered by the rich as a mechanism to suppress the poor, and to keep the rich in the place of power. You don\u2019t need political party system for democracy, what you need is ascent.\n\nAn example. In 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari polled over 15 million votes to become the president. What happened to other millions of Nigerians who didn\u2019t vote? But it didn\u2019t stop him from becoming the president, as long as those people agree that whoever polls the largest votes becomes the president. That ascent is democratic. If you look at the football mundial, you find out that when they were about to pair teams at a particular time in the competition, they put them in a box and people will just come and draw; they say Nigeria will play Brazil. There has never been any quarrel about it because it is a democratic process. So, we don\u2019t need political parties. As we don\u2019t need political parties, we don\u2019t also need ministers or commissioners because the civil service structure has been running for ages. They are political appointees that have no relevance; they are just there as part of the victory charm for their political parties to do whatever they want to do with those positions. If we curtail all of these political excesses, Nigeria will be better for it, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting.\n\nWhat you are saying, for instance, is that the NMA should be given the power to make laws on health?\n\nYes, that is what I\u2019m saying. Let the constitution enable these people who are within the society; you don\u2019t need other people representing them, let them represent themselves so that if you want to make a law you go to those establishments. For instance, NUT was established in 1931, NBA was established in 1933, NMA was established in 1951, they predate all these political parties; even ASUU was established in 1978. If we are truly practising democracy, then go to the people themselves, why asking people to represent people when the people can represent themselves and they are not paid? All that cost of spending billions on an institution that is a replication of what we already have will not be there again. If you empower these institutions, they will give us laws that are more appropriate and very relevant to them. That would be true democracy; it could be a presidential system devoid of an institution that is unnecessary.\n\nHow long will the interim government last if it is set up?\n\nIt depends on the responsibility and the terms of reference and terms and rules of engagement. The important thing that we need to understand is that you cannot ask a man who is debilitated by some ailments to run a race; you have to fix him first. Nigeria cannot run the race of joining the comity of nations when we are incapacitated, when we are fractured and polarised, it is not possible. We need to fix the nation first before we start talking of the political process.\n\nLook at the party primaries and the things that we have seen in the political arena, it is disheartening and it\u2019s done with so impunity right in your face and that is because we lost sight of what truly democracy is and that is why we need to pause; there has to be a hiatus. Some of our great politicians have qualified for the next election as flag bearers \u2013 Their Excellencies Atiku Abubakar, Bola Tinubu, Peter Obi and others. These are Nigerians first of all and they understand as patriots that this nation is greater than anybody and if they love this nation and I believe they do, they must align themselves with the current situation that something must be done outside what has transpired for so many years. We cannot proceed to the polls, it is a journey in futility and elusive, it is like trying to embrace an elusive phantom. Nothing is going to come out of it and we are back to square one. So, an interim government is the only way forward.\n\nBut these presidential flag bearers are saying that they are well aware of these problems and are prepared to tackle them and reposition the country.\n\nThey may have such intentions, but the concept of the political system that we are operating is faulty ab initio. It is not a question of saying that I will do this and that. I\u2019m saying, the reason we have these problems, which are symptoms of a major pathological situation that we have not addressed, is because we are always addressing symptoms. What are they going to do about the definition of federalism; how are they going to do that because the constitution that we are using doesn\u2019t support federalism. How are you going to change that; how are you going to change that fundamental issue of what is it that holds us together as a nation?\n\nSo, you have to get a new constitution and you cannot do as a sitting government; it is not possible because of political interests. You need a mechanism that is not connected to any political party; that doesn\u2019t have that kind of interest and can sit down dispassionately and say, this constitution is faulty; we need a democratic constitution and not the one that was handed over to us by the military. We need to address issues that affect our relationship. What is federalism to us? What is resource control to us? What is regional xenophobia to us? What are the forces militating against the unity and coherence of our federalism? These are things that must be done dispassionately outside the political parties.\n\nWhere and when did this rain start to beat Nigeria that we got to this level that you are talking about?\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time, but we have the tendency to sweep things under the carpet. Our political ancestors, the patriots that handed over democracy to us, made frantic attempts to bring unity to our country, but it was not that possible. Going back to Independence, you will still find out that Nigeria was balkanised along ethnic lines. It was already there and I believe that the patriots were hoping that with time, our people would rise to a place where these cleavages would diminish to a superficial laceration in terms of national integration. But it didn\u2019t happen. Then the military came in and the country became more divided. So, as we progressed, instead of sitting down and stopping the entire process, and say, let us get a holistic approach to governance, people were more eager to be involved in political offices for self aggrandisement and have nothing to do with the nation. So it has steadily degenerated; a downward spiral and that is why we are here today. Thank God that we still have another chance to rectify these aberrations and put things in proper perspective, and that is why I\u2019m here. That is why I\u2019m speaking at this time, asking our people to join hands so that we can take Nigeria back to a place where healing can occur, where we can ameliorate the opinion of the people and they can rise and say, \u2018ok, we still have faith\u2019. It can only be done with an interim government.\n\nIf political parties are not relevant, what will be the vehicle to throw up leaders?\n\nThat is the example I have given you from football situation. For instance, if we don\u2019t have political parties and we don\u2019t have ministers, you don\u2019t have commissioners, what offices will they be running for? There is only one office you can run for, which is that of the president. There will be no governors. What we will have will be people who are elders, tetrarchs ,who are about 80 years old, who are volunteers, vested in the affairs of a particular state. You look at their qualifications, you look at their antecedents; how much they served the country, you collate their names, put them into a box and there is a draw. They are working with the civil service, professional associations who have now been empowered and given legislative powers. Their role is purely supervisory. That way, politics is no longer business. Anyone who is looking for service will be these people in that age or joining an association to make sure that they promote the cause of that association. If we do so, there is no access to the money, and a lot of these people who are in politics today will have to find another profession because politics is the biggest business to them. More so, our political conscience has not been developed enough to follow an American model; that is why we are where we are. We must evolve a system that caters to the cultural sensibilities of our people; understanding how our people are, and knowing that if you give access to funds, governmental monies, you are going to breed more corruption and we are intelligent enough and that is why I\u2019m suggesting this mechanism. If we follow this suggestion you will find out that the people are in charge of their destiny and no one person will come and tell them what to do with the money of a state or how they want to dispense these monies. It will be the responsibility of the people themselves.\n\nWhy must you be the person to run this \u2018interim government\u2019?\n\nI\u2019m the person to run it because you cannot know a product better than the manufacturer. It is a concept I evolved; therefore, you cannot understand it better than I do. Secondly, I have never been a part of this problem; a part of any major political party. If I wanted a political career, I would have joined APC or PDP, but I evolved a political party so that I would have a podium to talk to Nigerians about the future of our country, not for political office. Many of these people whose names are being touted today were neophytes when I ran for president in 2003. The concept of national leadership has not even registered in the metrics of their political thoughts. If I had joined PDP or any other party at that time, I would have been a chieftain by now, but I wasn\u2019t looking for a career, I was looking for a solution for a nation that was gradually disintegrating. That is why I have sat back, prayed about it and came out with a solution. Thirdly, I have paid my dues, denominated in resilience and tenacity; I\u2019m a known face. I\u2019m successful at what I do and Nigerians need someone who has not been a part of this system, who has that compassion and intellectual capacity and understands the pain of the people. I have never been drawn into the vortex of partisan politics, and that is why I believe that I can handle the job.\n\nNow if Nigerians, the legislators and the presidency don\u2019t buy into this your proposal, what does it portend for the country?\n\nIt will bring disaster, catastrophe, calamity and tragedy. You can see where we are headed; the indicators are very clear that if we do not do something now while we have the time, this nation will break into fragments. It could even lead to war because there is so much anger, there is so much resentment. The politicians have divided us into ethnicity and religion. That is why we must do something at this point in time. Only a credible leader can have the kind of support from Nigerian people for this kind of project because they themselves know what is going on. Things are so bad. I have been a pastor for about 35 years, and I work with people and I know the pain, their anguish, the resentment that is growing in the polity; we must do something to assuage the situation. Those who know Chris Okotie know that I only stand on the truth. I believe that as I begin to expatiate and elucidate this concept, our people will listen because they know that is the only way forward. If not we are back to square one. We don\u2019t need a regime change; we need a system change. Nigeria must change its system of operation. That is the only way we can have peace, unity and prosperity.\n\nYou ran for president three times and failed. With this interim government proposal, people would ask, aren\u2019t you trying to get political power now through the backdoor?\n\nIt\u2019s such a jejune \u2018infantility\u2019; that is such a political naivety. If Buhari had run on the platform of Fresh Democratic Party, would he have won an election? No. If former President Olusegun Obasanjo had run on the platform of Justice Party, would he have won the election? No. If former President Goodluck Jonathan had run on the platform of Fresh Democratic Party, would he have won? No, because they understand that politics is a game of numbers. If I wanted a political career, I would have become a member of the dominant parties. Anybody who is making that kind of statement, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is totally illogical. Some people cannot decipher the Chris Okotie enigma and sometimes they articulate incoherent inconsistency because it is not logical. You cannot beat PDP on a platform of a political party that does not have structures. I didn\u2019t go into politics for a political career; I went into politics to teach, to demonstrate to the people that it is possible to be patriotic, to have a nation that understands nationalistic sentiments. That is why I didn\u2019t join those parties. So anybody who makes that kind of statement is na\u00efve. Why are they all struggling to be the flag bearers of APC and PDP? It is for obvious reasons that in today\u2019s politics people don\u2019t vote for personalities, but they vote for parties.\n\nGive us a glimpse of this interim government arrangement?\n\nWe are going to offer the world a new concept of democracy, which is people-oriented, which is a mechanical externalisation of the true definition of that concept. When the Greek called it democracy, they were speaking from two words: Demos \u2013 people and Cratus \u2013 invisible power. That is, when you look at governance, what you see is people and their power. But in Nigeria what you see is the party and that is not democracy. What we are going to do is to bring back the true definition of democracy by giving power to the people. The only way you could do that is to eliminate the legislature. Once we put that into practice, other parts of the world would begin to adopt it. If you take a look at the world today, politics is dominated by the rich. The party concept of politics was introduced by rich men to hoodwink the people into thinking that they were involved in the democratic process. What I\u2019m proposing will demystify this and bring democracy back to the people.\n\nBy the time this your concept is applied, what system of government do you call it \u2013 presidential, parliamentary?\n\nI call it Aboriginal Democracy because it goes back to the roots. This is government from the people for the people with the people. It will be a new concept completely; you have an executive, the judiciary and the people. If you want to become part of the lawmaking process, you join your union or association, but if you want to run for an office you don\u2019t need to join a political party, you just go by the mechanism that would be set up, maybe by the Ministry of Justice or Internal Affairs. If you qualify, your name will be put into a box and a draw is organised. You don\u2019t need to campaign.",

          "title": "Kwara Debt: Dancing Naked in the Market \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Wahab Oba\n\nPainting is an incredible work of art. With expert dabbing of brilliant colours, it easily transforms an otherwise horrible environment to one of outstanding spectacle. Only those who knew the environment before the artist worked on it can truly say what it was before the transformation.\n\nAs a painter, Rafiu Ajakaiye, chief press secretary to the Kwara state governor, tried his best bet to dab bright colours on the drab administration for which he is the spokesperson. Comparing the reality on ground with what he scribbled about his government and the debt debate, he should ordinarily take his stand with the Picassos of this world. Only that the true artist reflects society as it ought to be, without pretending; without lying, unlike what the CPS has done.\n\nThere are several issues in his response to the alarm raised by Alh Shuaibu Yaman, PDP\u2019s gubernatorial candidate, on the rising debt profile of Kwara state. An unassailable fact in his response, however, is that Ajakaiye in the entire epistle only confirmed what Yaman cried out about: the AA administration is driving Kwara towards a financial precipice and this is a clear evidence of poor grasp of public financing by a man touted as a wizard in that field.\n\nAjakaye only confirmed the position that his boss has increased the state domestic debt to over N100 billion in just a period of three years. \u201cThis\u201d, Yaman has said, \u201cis incredibly alarming\u201d and urged AbdulRahman to speak with Kwarans, as his party promised during campaigns towards his election not to take loans in running the affairs of the state. Mallam Ajakaye, is the governor too big to explain to Kwarans why his loans did not follow established legislative processes? Is he too nervous or scared to answer questions from Kwarans directly? When last did he personally and directly dialogue with the state? Is he waiting for elections to buy their votes? Kwarans are wiser.\n\nAgain, Ajakaye failed to tell the public that N17billion bond collected by Dr Bukola Saraki has been fully paid off as at Sept 2014 by the administration of Dr Abdulfatah Ahmed. Also, that the N17billion bond projects can be seen across the state generating more revenues into the purse of the state even as at today. Thus, Kwara State University, KWASU, Malete, Aviation College, Ilorin, Shonga farms, Diagnostic Centre and others are not only generating immense resources to the purse of the state, but contributing to national and global recognition of the state. I challenge AA to name just one similar project from the over N50bn accumulated as domestic debt alone.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt and intellectual honesty, we must be able to remind and tell the public that the N17bn bond has been paid and not included in the state\u2019s current debt profile. That can be confirmed online or with Debt Management Office, DMO. But rather than paying off debt, this government is only accumulating additional debt for the state and embarking on projects that can not generate revenue to net it off.\n\nLet it also be on record that the short term loans collected by the administration of Dr Abdulfatah Ahmed to augment the shortfalls in the revenue of the state, were fully paid back before the expiration of the administration as a result of the foresight and financial reengineering of the state revenue sources. In those eight years, he initiated far reaching projects that changed the face of governance in Nigeria and enhanced the fortune of the people of the state. Ajakaye, have you forgotten Kwara State Internal Revenue Services, KWIRS, Infrastructure Development Fund, IF-K, the School of Engineering in KWASU, Ajasse-Ipo International Vocational Centre and Kwara State Land Administration Secretariat, KWLAS, a one stop shop for land related matters? What about Light Up Kwara Project planned to illuminate the whole state which your government unfortunately aborted?\n\nAnd again, can Kwarans ever believe you after all your lies of those era? Yes, your lies. You lied about N2bn being collected every month by Saraki; you lied about ownership of Shonga Farms; you lied about ownership of harmony holdings; you lied about ownership of Aviation College, and your friend and ally lied about sales of Emir\u2019s palace and Yidi prayer ground. Until you apologised for all your lies about the Offa robbery, you ever remain an intellectually dishonest folks.\n\nLet\u2019s now address more substantive issues that the painter obviously wants to cover up. Number one is the historical reality that Alhaji Yaman was with the O To Ge group in 2019. He left the house because he saw the ravaging bull in the house. Several other champions of the movement had since left. Somehow, the painter wants to dab colours over this reality. But those of us who knew how the house of O To Ge was, know the truth. And we are in the majority in Kwara who understand that Ajakaiye is only covering up a sordid environment with colours of different hues. But no matter what, the ugly reality will not go away.\n\nSecondly, it is gratifying to note that our artist drew our attention to the reality that today the N17bn bond of 2009, then estimated at $113m, is the equivalence of N67.8bn in today\u2019s monetary rate of 600 naira per dollar. Let us remind Ajakaiye that also the price of cooking gas in 2009 was probably less than N300 per kilogram but today it is N1000. Also that the price of diesel at that same 2009 was far less than what it is today. Same for kerosene. Same for aviation fuel. Same for air tickets. Same for road transportation. Same for rice and other food items.\n\nWe should, therefore, ask who brought the present evil on us. The Yoruba have a profound way of telling a supposed helper to go away whenever they realise he has come to add more to their burden than relief them. They say, \u201cOrisa bi o le gbe mi, se mi bi o se da mi\u201d. Leave me as I was before you came on the scene if you are not capable of helping me out. That is the song on the lips of Kwarans today having realised that, yes indeed, the O To Ge episode was a misnomer and grand deception. And they are asking the rudderless leadership of that era to leave them and allow them make the right decision for their well-being. Any attempt to justify the current debt profile of this administration is tantamount to dancing naked in the village market.\n\nA prosperous Kwara is possible.\n\n*Wahab Oba, former NUJ.Chair, Lagos State Council, writes from Ilorin.",

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for former Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai in Abuja.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00pm and 12:00am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Recently, there have been uproars on and off social media about Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president and his wife, Beatrice, who were arrested by the United Kingdom Police over alleged child trafficking and conspiracy to harvest an organ of a child.\n\nOrgan trafficking sometimes known as transplant tourism describes the commercialism that drives the illegal organ trade.\n\nThe United States National Organ and Transplant Act of 1984 list human organ as the human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, bone marrow, cornea, eye, bone and skin or any subpart thereof and any other human organ or any subpart thereof, including that derived from a fetus. A report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) stated that children in extremely low-income families are particularly vulnerable to organ transplants, including in countries in West Africa, making up one of every three victims worldwide\n\nAccording to the United Network for Organ Sharing, Organ trafficking is defined as the purchase of a transplanted organ abroad while bypassing laws, rules or processes of any or all countries involved.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), organ trade is the buying and selling of organs outside of national medical systems and for profit. Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimates that 10 percent of all organ transplants including lungs, heart and liver, are done via trafficked organs.\n\nHowever, the most prominent organs that are traded illicitly are kidneys, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that 10,000 kidneys are traded on the black market worldwide annually, or more than one every hour.\n\nRead also; NYSC DG solicits support of stakeholders for its health initiative\n\nIn Nigeria, the most trafficked organ is the kidney. From the year 2015 to 2020, a total of 651 kidneys were transplanted illegally from the country, Global Database on Donation and Transplantation reported.\n\nIt is estimated that the illegal organ trade conservatively generates approximately $840 million to $1.7 billion annually, according to Global financial integrity.\n\nGFI estimates that prices paid to individuals for their organs vary significantly. For kidneys, payments reportedly range from hundreds of dollars to individuals from less developed countries to up to $20,000-$30,000 in more developed countries.\n\nIn 2020, the Global Database on Donation and Transplantation said 129,681 organs were transplanted annually. From the total sum, 36,125 were harvested from deceased donors and 15 transplants were done per hour.\n\nMost countries forbid the sale and purchase of organs except Iran. The middle eastern country is the only place in the world where citizens are allowed to buy and sell their organs legally.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, \u201corgan trafficking may be facilitated by corrupt officials or criminal groups and may include brokers or other middlemen who connect individuals providing the organ with prospective recipients, negotiate the price, and identify medical facilities where the transplant can occur\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, even with the estimated flow of funds crossing $1 billion annually, it is difficult for both the law enforcement agents and anti-money laundering professionals to detect related financial activity, according to a report by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS).",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government, through African Network for Economic and Environment Justice (ANEEJ), on Thursday, said that the $322.5million recovered Abacha loot, has been shared to 1.9million poor and vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nThe said funds were stolen by former Military Head of State, Gen Sani Abacha and were recovered between 2018 and 2022.\n\nBefore making the disbursement, the money accrued an interest of $11 million where it was deposited.\n\nExecutive Director of ANEEJ, Rev. David Ugolor made this disclosure while briefing Journalists on, in Abuja.\n\nHe said an interest of $11 million accrued from the money where it was saved and it was disbursed to around 1.9 million poor Nigerians selected without political bias.\n\n\u201cNo politically motivated data was used in selecting the beneficiaries; the National Social Register was used to determine those who will benefit and the register is updated regularly to remove those who have died,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cthe Abacha loot that was recovered have been exhausted, we have a responsibility to inform Nigerians and then to make sure to tell them what the money was used for.\n\n\u201cIt is a very controversial issue that people sit down at home and begin to point fingers that Abacha\u2019s money has been stolen. What we have done with this monitoring is very ground breaking.\u201d\n\nUgolor, however, expressed concern that when the federal government stopped disbursing the funds to the beneficiaries in 2021, four states which are Kebbi, Ondo, Edo and Enugu were excluded .\n\nHe said updates on the disbursement of the Conditional Cash Transfer showed that four states had been left out since 2019 due to technical reason.\n\nHe said: \u201cfour states have not been benefiting from the distribution of these N5,000, so we started an advocacy and the advocacy yielded the results and the government responded through the National Cash Transfer Office (NCTO) and we have since paid all these four states. The four states are Edo, Ondo, Kebi and Enugu.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, Switzerland returned USD322.5 million of stolen funds (illicitly acquired by the late General Sani Abacha\u2019s family) to the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Finance, however, requested that the funds be used to finance the $500 million IDA-financed National Social Safety Net Program (NASSP) in the form of Conditional Cash Transfers to poor and vulnerable Nigerians, which is one of the poverty alleviation programmes under the National Social Investment Programme.\n\nA Swiss court in March 2015 ordered that the funds be repatriated on the condition that the World Bank monitors their use. Consequently, a Memorandum of understanding was entered into between the Nigeria government, the Swiss government, and the World Bank, which also identified Network on Asset Recovery (NAR) made up of civil society organizations led by ANEEJ as an independent monitor for the purpose of providing an independent report on the use of the funds.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Justice then developed and finalized terms of reference for civil society organizations monitoring the $322.5million recovered Abacha loot and recognized ANEEJ as one of the CSOs representing the NAR in interactions with the Federal Government of Nigeria. The task was to monitor and report on the use of the funds to targeted beneficiaries.\n\nIn 2018, ANEEJ commenced the monitoring exercise under the Monitoring of Recovered Assets in Nigeria through the Transparency and Accountability (MANTRA) project. Through the MANTRA project, ANEEJ worked with six regional partners, and engaged a total of 35 CSOs and over 500 monitors for the exercise in six geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nThe exercise produced the first disbursement report of the $322.5million covering the August/September 2018 payment round to beneficiaries in 19 States.",

          "text": "Femi Fani-Kayode, former aviation minister, has celebrated the \u2018return\u2019 of his ex-wife, Precious Chikwendu, describing the moment as truly surreal.\n\nChikwendu whose separation from the ex-minister in 2020 over alleged domestic violence, heralded months of intense hostility, including court cases, accusations and counter accusations, visited him on Saturday.\n\nOn Thursday Fani-Kayode issued a statement, describing their reunion as a truly surreal and historic moment.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in two years, totally unexpectedly and out of the blue, and after she took our sons Aragorn, Ragnar, Aiden, and Liam out for yet another beautiful outing, Mama Aragorn came to the house to visit with us,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cFor two years she and I had not seen or spoken to one another but on Saturday afternoon we spent no less than four hours together in which we talked, laughed, and shared some beautiful moments.\n\n\u201cIt was touching to see members of my household and staff receive her and, led by our first son Aragorn who held her tightly by the hand, usher her through the gates and into the compound as I watched in utter disbelief and surprise from the balcony.\n\n\u201cMoments earlier I had seen them walking down from the top of the road through the CCTV cameras and from the same balcony.\n\n\u201cIt was a small crowd, led by Aragorn and his mother. They walked slowly with radiant smiles and laughter whilst a convoy of cars followed them from behind.\n\n\u201cIt was the dramatic return of a great and beautiful queen who was simply resplendent and who shone as brightly as the morning star.\n\n\u201cThere are some moments that words cannot capture or express and this was one of them. After two long years of contentious silence and acrimonious separation, she graced us with her presence and came home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress chieftain further said, \u201cIt was joy all around to see the return of this great lioness. Every single one of the 60 people that live and work in our home was happy to see her and some even shed a few secret tears of joy.\n\n\u201cMama Aragorn displayed such courage, grace, dignity, and class. This was a moment that I shall cherish for many years. This was a triumph for all lovers of peace and sons and daughters of righteousness.\n\n\u201cThis was the day that the power of God was made manifest, that joy came to Zuma close, and that the Lion of Aso Drive roared in glory, victory, power, and strength.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment that proved beyond all reasonable doubt that patience, restraint, understanding and peace bring nothing but joy and blessings.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment when light overcame darkness and when the secret prayers of four handsome little Princes were answered.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment when love, mutual respect, truth, and mutual forgiveness triumphed and Satan was put to shame.\n\n\u201cThanks for coming, Mama Aragorn. We love and appreciate you. Always did, always will. And though we have gone our separate ways the bond and cord that exists between us through our four beautiful boys can never be broken.\n\n\u201cI also offer my thanks to my loyal and faithful wife and a true Daughter of Zion, Mama Remi, and to Mama Folake, Mama Arwen, my beautiful daughters Folake and Remi, my son Nicholas and my entire family and household for their collective and unconditional love, understanding, resilience, loyalty, support, and patience.\n\n\u201cYou stood firm, strong, and bold and you kept encouraging me even through the raging storm and darkest moments. Love conquered all and saw us through and so it shall continue to be.\n\n\u201cFrom generation to generation our circle of love, our fellowship, our family, our children, and our loved ones shall rise and go from strength to strength.\n\n\u201cIn every situation and circumstance, we shall prevail and the God that we serve shall never forsake us. So it is and so it shall be. God bless you all.\u201d",

Impact investments can deliver measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns in our economies. Hence, we are looking for social entrepreneurs who are running commercially viable businesses that deliver profit as well as social and environmental impact to apply for the programme. We want solutions that can scale from community to community, enriching lives as they go,\u201d she added.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the host organization, Sterling One Foundation, CEO of the Foundation, Olapeju Ibekwe, highlighted that a better framework for sustainable financing is one of the key anticipated outcomes from the Summit, and the Deal Room is a snapshot into how the framework will function.\n\n\u201cThe Deal Room session will show the different players exactly how homegrown solutions can be backed with impact investment and the right partnerships to help our continent recover from the negative effects of COVID-19 and continue to grow\u201d, she said.\n\nEntrepreneurs who wish to apply must have been running their businesses for at least a year, and meet other eligibility criteria as stated on the application portal \u2013 www.theimpactsummit.org/dealroom",

          "text": "The Supreme Court has struck out a suit by President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami SAN seeking to void the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIn a judgment on Friday, a seven-member panel of the apex court, headed by Justice Musa Dattijo Mohammed, was unanimous in holding that President Buhari, having participated in the making of the law by assenting to it, could not turn around to fault its provisions.\n\nThe court upheld all the grounds of objection raised by the National Assembly, through its lawyer, Dr. Olukayode Ajulo, against the competence of the suit marked: SC/504/2022.\n\nThe President and the AGF had through their Lawyer, Lateef Fagbemi SAN argued among others, that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act was made in excess of the constitutional powers of the National Assembly and therefore, unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, agreed with Ajulo that the suit is not one of such cases in respect of which the court\u2019s original and additional jurisdictions could be invoked under Section 23(2)(1) of the Constitution and Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002.\n\nThe court faulted the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the suit was informed by the National Assembly\u2019s failure to give effect to President Buhari\u2019s request that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act be deleted for allegedly offending the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe apex court held that the President lacked the constitutional or legal rights or power to request or compel the National Assembly to amend or make an Act.\n\nIn the lead judgment, Justice Emmanuel Agim noted that the suit touched on the essence of the powers given to the President by Section 58(4) of the 1999 Constitution, which he exercised by participating in the making of the E. A. 2022.\n\nJustice Agim held that since the President aided the creation of the Act, with the support of the AGF, both plaintiffs could not turn around to query its legality.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Constitution did not provide for the involvement of the court by the President after exercising his powers under Section 58(4) of the Constitution one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI agree with the argument by the counsel to the National Assembly (Ajulo) that this suit is reprobation of what the first plaintiff (the President) had approbated, and this cannot be allowed in law.\n\n\u201cHaving assented to the Electoral Bill 2022 and thereby accepted that it has become law, he cannot, therefore, bring a suit, contending that the actions resulting from his assent is not constitutional, desirable and justifiable, thereby detracting from his assent.\n\n\u201cAs it is, one of the cumulative requirements in Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002 for the invocation of the additional jurisdiction of this court to entertain an originating suit between the President and the National Assembly does not exist.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have no legally enforceable legal right or power that gives life to questions raised for determination in the originating summons, and that can be protected or enforced by the reliefs claimed for.\n\n\u201cThe dispute, in this case, does not involve any question or include the existence or extent of any legal right to the plaintiffs. Therefore, this suit cannot be entertained by this court in the exercise of its additional jurisdiction under Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002\n\n\u201cEven the original jurisdiction vested in this court by Section 23(2)(1) of the 1999 Constitution to determine disputes between the federation and the state or between states cannot be invoked unless the dispute involves any question on which the existence of a legal right depends.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of the Constitution that makes the exercise of the legislative power of the National Assembly subject to the direction and control of the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe first plaintiff\u2019s (the President) written request to the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act 2022 by deleting Section 84(12) therein, is a violation of Section 4(1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis suit, which was filed in response to the refusal of the National Assembly to grant the said request is an employment of the judicial process to help realise the said violation.\n\n\u201cThe court cannot be engaged in this kind of unconstitutional and illegal enterprise. The suit is, therefore, an abuse of the judicial process,\u201d Justice Agim said.\n\nHe further agreed with Ajulo that the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and added that there was no useful purpose to be served by determining the case on the merit.\n\nOther members of the panel \u2013 Justices John Okoro, Amina Augie, Mohammed Garba, Abdu Aboki and Ibrahim Saulawa \u2013 agreed with the lead judgment.",

          "text": "A consultant working in a NHS hospital refused to remove a vital organ from a 15-year-old allegedly trafficked to London from the streets of Lagos by the former deputy president of the Nigerian Senate and his wife, a court has heard.\n\nThe doctor at the Royal Free in Camden became suspicious about whether the alleged victim was aware he was the donor of the kidney and whether he was 41 as his passport claimed.\n\nIke Ekweremadu, 60, and Beatrice Ekweremadu, 55, are accused of taking the homeless youngster to the UK from Nigeria to transplant his organs into their daughter who is suffering from kidney failure.\n\nThe 15-year-old was given the passport of a 41-year-old in order to get into the UK, but did not know he was there to donate a kidney until he went on a hospital appointment in London, a court heard on Friday.\n\nAfter he arrived in the capital in February he had a string of medical appointments about kidney donation, but a consultant at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London, became concerned about the boy\u2019s real age and if he knew he was there to donate an organ, it is alleged.\n\nMr Ekweremadu has been an elected senator at the Abuja-based parliament since 2003 after moving into politics after years as a lawyer. His wife, five years his junior, is an academic and doctor and also a major public figure in Nigeria. They are believed to have four adult children. Both deny trafficking the boy.\n\nProsecutor Damla Ayas told Uxbridge Magistrates Court yesterday: \u2018The victim was 15. In Nigeria he was approached by both defendants. He was homeless on the streets of Lagos. They deceived him and promised him a better life in the UK. He was given a passport for a 41-year-old. The passport was illegally obtained by these defendants.\n\nHe was provided with a medical travel visa saying the purpose of the travel was to provide medical treatment for the defendants\u2019 daughter who was undergoing dialysis in relation to a number of health issues.\n\n\u2018It was premeditated, it was planned. Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he travelled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u2018He was taken to several medical appointments in particular a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u2018The consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital\u2019.\n\nPolice were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery laws last month.\n\nEkweremadu has been in the UK for at least the past fortnight having met with members of the Nigerian community in Britain in Lincoln around ten days ago.\n\nHe tweeted: \u2018It was a pleasure and an honour to receive a letter of appointment by the University of Lincoln, UK, as Visiting Professor of Corporate and International Linkages. I also got a highly treasured gift \u2013 a copy of the Magna Carta. It was created in 1215, about 807 years ago\u2019.\n\nThey arrested the couple two days ago at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey \u2013 where it was suggested that the procedure could take place \u2013 the court heard.\n\nEkweremadu, 60, is said to have had \u00a320,000 on him at the time of his arrest, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe child is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police, officials say.\n\n(Dailymail)\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

The miss would knock hard seven minutes later, when Abdulramane Ouedraogo, also with a header, equalized for Burkina Faso.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half, Abdullahi got his second and Nigeria\u2019s second, taking the Golden Eaglets to a 2-1 lead. However, 12 minutes later, he should have made it a hat-trick and Nigeria\u2019s third but he lost the opportunity.\n\nThat loss could once more have proved costly, as the Stallions broke forward, only to see Nigeria goalkeeper Richard Odoh come up with a magnificent save.\n\nIn the 67th minute, Ebube Okeke rocked the crossbar from 25 yards, but there were to be no more goals and Nigeria collected a second regional diadem at youth level five weeks after the U20 boys defeated neighbours Benin Republic in the final to win the WAFU B competition in Niger Republic.\n\nNigeria goalkeeper Richard Odoh was selected the Man-of-the-Match.

In this case, the president gave his assent,\u201d Agim ruled.\n\nHe added that the request by President Buhari to the National Assembly to delete the provision amounted to Constitutional violation.\n\n\u201cThe president has no power to request or compel the National Assembly to amend any part of the Act of the National Assembly in which he has participated in its making. This suit cannot be entertained by this court under Section 1(1) (a) of the Additional Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court Act. \u201c\n\nOther members of the panel consented to the lead judgement; they are Dattijo-Muhammad, John Okoro, Amina Augie, Lawal Garba and Ibrahim Saulawa.\n\nPresident Buhari and Malami had argued that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 was inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), as well Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and People and Peoples Rights.\n\nThey were seeking an order of the court to strike out the Section of the Act which, they said, was inconsistent with the nation\u2019s Constitution.\n\nThe Clause reads, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nIn March, both chambers of the National Assembly rejected the president\u2019s request to amend the clause in the electoral act.\n\nSubsequently, the Attorney General boasted that the federal government would consider all other options available before taking a position on the matter.\n\nIn the suit marked SC/CV/504/2022, Buhari and Malami were seeking an order of the court to strike out the Section of the Act.\n\nThe National Assembly, however, asked the Supreme Court to strike out the suit instituted by Buhari and Malami (SAN) over Section 84 (12) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2022.\n\nPresident Buhari had, on February 25, signed the electoral bill into law with a caveat that the Section should be deleted in order to deepen democracy in the country.\n\nBut the National Assembly in March threw out the president\u2019s request and insisted that serving political appointees must resign before contesting elections.\n\nMalami, who also opposed the lawmakers\u2019 decision, vowed that the federal government would explore other means, including the court, to ensure the provision that he said offended other sections of the Constitution, was expunged from the amended Act.\n\nReps\u2019 reaction\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives has hailed the Supreme Court judgement.\n\nThe spokesperson of the House, Benjamin Kalu, gave the commendation while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Friday in Abuja.\n\nThe court on June 24 said the president lacked the power to direct the National Assembly to amend or enact an Act, adding that it violated the principle of separation of powers.\n\nKalu said the lower house was happy with the Supreme Court judgement, adding that the House was not expecting anything less because the judges were erudite scholars.\n\n\u201cThese are people who have followed the trend of event and understand the separation of power and the mandate of each arms of government. They understand that the separation of power is one of the tools of democracy and each arm focuses on the responsibilities of their mandate,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the mandate of the House was law-making with the intention of breaching a gap created in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that was not captured, adding that the House of Reps could only do this by looking at Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Amendment Act.\n\n\u201cAlthough, many of you thought that it was either self-serving or targeted at individuals, the law is made to advance our democracy, especially to increase the competitive elements in our democracy for credible election.\u201d\n\nHe added that the competitive element was necessary to advance the country\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cThis judgement is unequivocally embracing and heart-warming; it is not a victory for the House of Representatives, but victory for the advancement of our democracy and the rule of law.\n\nAccording to him, the judgement is a victory for the supremacy of law-making and the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cLet us celebrate this victory; the judiciary has added its own quota to the advancement of democracy. The Electoral Act, nation-building is a joint task.\u201d\n\nCHOGM 2022: Buhari congratulates Patricia Scotland on re-appointment, lists expectations (2nd)\n\nBy Abdullahi M. Gulloma\n\nAbuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Baroness Patricia Scotland, on her reappointment as Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.\n\nLeaders of the Commonwealth meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on Friday reappointed Scotland by consensus for a further two years to complete the balance of her period in office.\n\nIn a congratulatory message by his spokesman, Mr. Femi Adesina, on Friday in Abuja, the Nigerian leader commended the purposeful leadership of the Dominican-born barrister and diplomat in the last six years.\n\nHe lauded her for championing the values of the association in the areas of youth, women and childcare, trade, among others.\n\nThe president expressed delight that under her tenure the organisation is alive to its responsibilities in promoting shared commonwealth values and aspirations.\n\nHe said such aspirations aimed at supporting collective interventions in health, climate change, environment, sustainable energy, ocean protection and blue economies, small and vulnerable island states, good governance, rule of law and democracy.\n\nBuhari also welcomed the various Declarations presented for consideration and adoption during CHOGM 2022 namely; the Declaration on Sustainable Urbanisation; the Commonwealth Living Lands Charter; and the Kigali Declaration on Childcare and Protection Reform.\n\nHe said the letter and spirit of those declarations were relevant to the common desire and aspirations to promote international peace and security, sustainable economic growth, development and the rule of law, good governance, democracy, respect for human rights and gender equality.\n\nThe president wished the secretary-general a very successful term in office, thanking her for being very supportive of Nigeria during her term in office.\n\n\u201dMy firm belief is that the Commonwealth will survive and thrive for as long as the principles of justice and equity remain the cornerstone of our political, economic and social contract.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote, stated this at the 2nd Nigerian Women in Oil and Gas Conference.\n\nWabote said that the Board would work on the policy and communicate same to the industry as soon as possible.\n\nThe conference was organised by the NCDMB in partnership with the Diversity Sectorial Working Group of the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF, which was set up by the NCDMB to advise it on policy directions.\n\nSpeaking on the $40m Women in Energy Fund which the NCDMB set up in partnership with the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, NEXIM Bank, the Executive Secretary indicated that 15 applications have been received and three have been approved and the disbursement of funds would soon start.\n\nHe added that the online portal for the fund was launched two weeks ago, and this would speed up the process and reduce human interface in the application and processing.\n\nHe commended the performance of women in various roles in the oil and gas industry and canvassed for their inclusion in the administration of the various Trusts and Funds that were established by the Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, 2021, notably the Host Community Development Trust, Host Community Development Trust Fund and Environmental Remediation Fund.\n\nSpeaking further, the NCDMB boss confirmed that the Oil and Gas Industrial Parks in Bayelsa State and Cross River state are getting ready for completion and will commence operations next year.\n\nHe noted that the Board had started inviting applicants for allocation of plots to set up manufacturing outfits in the park and encouraged women-owned businesses with workable proposals to apply as they will be given special consideration as part of the Board\u2019s commitment to mainstream women into the oil and gas industry.\n\nProviding an update on the administration of the Women in Energy Fund, the Managing Director of NEXIM Bank, Mr. Abba Bello explained that applicants would need to meet set criteria before they can access the fund.\n\n\u201cIt is a loan and not a grant and applicants have to meet the conditions, so we can achieve the intended purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nRepresented by the Head Specialised Products at the Bank, Mr. Mohammed Aumiz, the NEXIM Bank boss explained that it takes only 22 days for an application to be processed and an offer letter issued if the company met the criteria.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva commended the NCDMB for inaugurating the Diversity Sectorial Working Group under the NCCF as provided in Section 58 of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development, NOGICD Act.\n\nHe noted that women make up 48 percent of the global labour force, but they only account for 22 percent of the labour force in the oil and gas sector.\n\nQuoting a recent study by Global Energy Talent Index, the Minister said women occupy about 50 percent of non-technical positions at entry-level compared to only 15 percent of technical and field role positions, hinting that gender diversity and inclusion decreases with seniority, with only a tiny proportion of women in executive positions.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of women in the industry drops from 36 percent to 24 percent between the middle and executive level,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe confirmed that the Nigerian government has been deliberate in introducing gender-friendly policies aimed at increasing access to funding, award of contracts and support for research and development in the interest of women operators in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Minister harped on the need to be deliberate in getting more girls into Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics, STEM, which was a pathway to careers in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe also advised women in the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry to work together towards increasing participation of fellow women in the industry by engendering growth, building capacities and capabilities, identifying opportunities, mentoring and coaching.",

          "text": "US lawmakers broke a decades-long stalemate on firearms control Friday, passing the first major safety regulations in almost 30 years, less than 24 hours after the Supreme Court bolstered the right to bear arms.\n\nGun regulation is a touchstone issue for both conservatives and liberals in the United States that has consumed national politics amid multiple mass shootings in recent years.\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to rubber-stamp a bipartisan Senate gun bill that \u2014 while modest \u2014 amounts to the first significant piece of legislation to regulate firearms since 1994.\n\nFourteen Republicans defied their leader Kevin McCarthy to cross the aisle and approve the 80-page package, which advanced from the evenly-divided upper chamber with cross-party backing late Thursday.\n\nThat vote came hours after the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority had struck down a century-old New York law requiring permits for concealed-carry handguns.\n\nThe gun legislation includes enhanced background checks for younger buyers and federal cash for states introducing \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow courts to temporarily remove weapons from those considered a threat.\n\nBillions of dollars have been allocated to crack down on \u201cstraw purchasers\u201d who buy firearms for people who are not allowed them and to curb gun trafficking.\n\n\u2018Long-sought triumph\u2019\n\nThe deeply-divisive issue of gun control was reignited by two massacres in May that saw 10 Black supermarket shoppers gunned down in upstate New York and 21 people, mostly young children, slain at a school in Texas.\n\nThe Supreme court had voted along party lines, with the six Republican appointees in favor of bolstering the constitutional right to bear arms and the three Democratic appointees dissenting.\n\nThe ruling was hailed by campaigners for boosted gun rights, but took the shine off what was expected to be a day of jubilation for weapons control activists.\n\nLiberals had been celebrating the congressional action despite disappointment at the limited scope of the legislation, which doesn\u2019t include universal background checks and omits any ban on semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines.\n\n\u201cThis decision won\u2019t stop our grassroots army from doing what we\u2019ve done for a decade: fighting to keep our families safe,\u201d added Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said after the Supreme Court ruling was announced.\n\n\u201cJust as we\u2019re breaking the logjam in Congress, we\u2019re going to work day-in, day-out to mitigate the fallout in New York and any other states impacted by this decision and elect gun-sense lawmakers up and down the ballot.\u201d\n\nEric Tirschwell, chief litigation counsel at legal non-profit Everytown Law, said the Supreme Court had misapplied fundamental constitutional principles, and added that the group was \u201cready to go to court\u201d to defend restrictions.\n\nTop Republicans celebrated the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a long-sought triumph for lawful gun owners across America, it is a victory for all citizens and our constitutional order itself,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcCarthy hailed the ruling as a victory that \u201crightfully ensures the right of all law-abiding Americans to defend themselves without unnecessary government interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision comes at an important time \u2014 as the Senate considers legislation that undermines Second Amendment freedom,\u201d Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis decision unequivocally validates the position of the NRA and should put lawmakers on notice: no law should be passed that impinges this individual freedom.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Millions of women in the US will lose the legal right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling that legalised it nationwide.\n\nThe court struck down the landmark Roe v Wade decision, weeks after an unprecedented leaked document suggested it favoured doing so.\n\nThe judgement will transform abortion rights in America, with individual states now able to ban the procedure.\n\nHalf of US states are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans.\n\nThirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. A number of others are likely to pass new restrictions quickly.\n\nIn total, abortion access is expected to be cut off for about 36 million women of reproductive age, according to research from Planned Parenthood, a healthcare organisation that provides abortions.\n\nThe Supreme Court had been considering a case, Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, that challenged Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nBut the conservative-majority court ruled in favour of the state by a vote of six to three along ideological lines \u2013 effectively ending the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n\u201cWe therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion\u2026 and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives,\u201d part of the judgement read.\n\nThe ruling amounts to a wholesale reversal of the Supreme Court\u2019s own legal precedent \u2013 an extremely rare move \u2013 and is likely to set up political battles that divide the nation.\n\nIn states where opinions on abortion are closely split \u2013 such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 the legality of the procedure could be determined on an election-by-election basis. In others, the ruling may set off a new round of legal battles, including over whether individuals can go out of state for abortions or order abortion drugs through mail services.\n\nDemocratic governors of several states including California, New Mexico and Michigan have already announced plans to enshrine abortion rights within their constitutions if Roe v Wade is overturned.\n\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris also met with the Democratic attorney-generals of seven states on Thursday to discuss how to defend abortion rights, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case saw the Supreme Court rule by a vote of seven to two that a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\n\nThe ruling gave American women an absolute right to an abortion in the first three months (trimester) of pregnancy, but allowed for restrictions in the second trimester and for prohibitions in the third.\n\nBut in the decades since, anti-abortion rulings have gradually pared back access in more than a dozen states.\n\nBBC",
          "summary": "Millions of women in the US will lose the legal right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling that legalised it nationwide.\nThe court struck down the landmark Roe v Wade decision, weeks after an unprecedented leaked document suggested it favoured doing so.\nThe Supreme Court had been considering a case, Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, that challenged Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortion after 15 weeks.\nDemocratic governors of several states including California, New Mexico and Michigan have already announced plans to enshrine abortion rights within their constitutions if Roe v Wade is overturned.\nThe landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case saw the Supreme Court rule by a vote of seven to two that a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.",
