          "title": "ASUU strike: Students protest in Lagos, Benin, vow to block N\u2019 Assembly, airports",
          "text": "STUDENTS from various tertiary institutions in Edo State on Monday barricaded the gate of the Benin Airport, along Airport Road, in protest against the three-month extension to the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The resulting gridlock forced motorists to divert into the Government Reserved Area in search of alternative routes.\n\nASUU President, Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, had in a statement, after a meeting of its National Executive Council at the University of Abuja on Monday, announced the extension of the strike for another 12 weeks with a view to giving the Federal Government enough time to satisfactorily resolve all the outstanding issues between them.\n\nWhile the Federal Government through the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, stated that the government would resume talks with the lecturers this week, the union insisted that it was yet to get any official communication as regards the meeting.\n\nThe protesting students from the University of Benin; Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma; and Edo State Polytechnic, Usen, were also at the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Edo State Council, to register their grievances.\n\nThe President of UNIBEN\u2019s Students Union Government, Foster Amadin, said at the NUJ secretariat, \u201cWe are appealing to whosoever is concerned to help resolve this issue. We have also come to the NUJ secretariat as wise students who know the importance of the media to express our displeasure over the lingering ASUU strike.\u201d\n\nAlso, students of the University of Lagos, Akoka, staged a protest against the ongoing ASUU strike.\n\nThe students displayed placards, and banners, calling on the Federal Government to wade into the crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of Nigerian Students has condemned the strike extension, saying the failure of the government to reach an agreement with ASUU underscored its lack of concern and empathy towards the plight of average Nigerians who could not afford private universities.\n\nIt however called on students across the country to occupy all federal roads for a minimum of three hours on Tuesday, saying this later include the disruption of party primaries and total blockage of the National Assembly complex and access to all airports.\n\nNANS President, Sunday Asefon, in a statement titled \u2018ASUU strike extension: The silence of the government and the ruling class; the nation must feel the heat\u2019 in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, said having exhausted all windows for constructive engagement with the government, NANS had declared national action from Tuesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe National Action is tagged \u2018Operation Test Run\u2019. It shall be held in all the 36 states of the federation. Federal roads across the 36 states shall be occupied for a minimum of three hours. The operation shall be a precursor to a total shutdown that will be decided during our senate meeting/pre-convention on Saturday, May 14, 2022. Our decision from the pre-convention shall be binding.\n\n\u201cOur proposal to congress on May 14 shall be the total blockage of the airport roads across the country and total disruption of political party primaries, blockage of the National Assembly until they are committed to passing legislation banning public office holders from sending their children to universities abroad.\u201d\n\nHe warned those he described as \u201cdivisive elements or paid agents of government\u201d to steer clear of the students\u2019 actions while calling on the Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress and civil society organisations to join the students to salvage public tertiary education.\n\nStriking lecturers, not our workers \u2013 Ngige\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has said enquiries about the ongoing strike by ASUU should be directed to the Federal Ministry of Education and the National Universities Commission, noting that his ministry is not the direct employers of the striking lecturers.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have appealed to SSANU, NASU and NAAT to get back and open the universities so that when ASUU members come back, they will have a place to work. In the Ministry of Labour and Employment, we are conciliators and arbitrators.\n\n\u201cThose on strike are not our workers. Their direct employers are the universities and the Federal Ministry of Education. Any further queries on the ASUU strike should go to the Federal Ministry of Education and if possible, the National Universities Commission, who are their direct employers. We are here to conciliate them whenever either the employers or employees report to us that there is a breakdown in negotiations.\u201d\n\nStrike extension in the interest of students says ASUU\n\nSpeaking on the extension, the ASUU president said the decision of the union was in the interest of students and a way of rescuing the university system from further decay. The union has however asked its branches to hold congresses to deliberate on the next line of action.\n\nHe told one of our correspondents in an interview, \u201cWe also have students in school; Nigerians are not considering the plight of lecturers. A lecturer in Nigeria earns less than $600 a month whereas their counterparts in the United States earn almost $6,000, and you expect the other person to come and teach and believe everything is alright.\n\n\u201cWe started this strike three months ago. They have held my salary all along. Am I not thinking about a family? This fight is for the students. If our colleagues in the press and Nigerians take up this struggle, we will go back to class. Our universities are dying and we are trying to rescue them. If fellow Nigerians say they are not interested, academic staff are interested and we will not allow the system to die the way primary and secondary schools died.\u201d\n\nASUU stressed in the statement that the strike came on the heels of the government\u2019s failure to satisfactorily implement the Memorandum of Action it signed with the union in December 2020 on the renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU Agreement; deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution; Earned Academic Allowances; funding for the revitalisation of public universities; proliferation and governance issues in state universities; promotion arrears; withheld salaries; and non-remittance of third-party deductions.\n\nMinister counters union\n\nThe Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, faulted claims by the union that the government had been idle as regards meeting the demands of the union. He said the union could continue negotiations without being on strike, adding that the Ministry of Education was not the direct employer of the striking lecturers.\n\nNwajiuba, in an interview with one of our correspondents, said, \u201cLike I said in one of the videos trending, the Ministry of Education is not the direct employer of ASUU, every university has what is called a governing council. It is the council that employs you and when you are employed, you are transferred to the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cNow, you want us to convince the government to transfer your salaries from IPPIS. Even as a minister, I am paid via IPPIS but you are saying you have a system and you want the government to pay you via that platform.\n\n\u201cThis is my question; can you not continue negotiations without being on strike? Surely you can continue negotiations without a strike. There isn\u2019t a rational thought or logic when people are angry. No employee would abuse a so-called employer the way ASUU has been abusing us.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Despite form denial, Jonathan meets Adamu, prepares to run on APC ticket",
          "text": "Soni Daniel, Abuja\n\nAmidst attempt by loyalists of former president Goodluck Jonathan to stop him from running on the All Progressives Congress ticket, the former president, has formally met with the National Chairman of the ruling party in Abuja, apparently to clarify some grey areas regarding his candidacy.\n\nFormer President Jonathan, who was reported to have rejected a N100 million nomination form procured for him by some Fulani pastoralists, later met behind closed doors in Adamu\u2019s house.\n\nA source close to the former president said that the meeting, whose details were not made public, lasted between 9pm and 10 pm in a bid to sort out some grey issues regarding Jonathan\u2019s bid to fly the party\u2019s presidential flag in next year\u2019s poll.\n\nIt was learnt that the confusion that trailed the purchase of the form for Jonathan arose because of the spirited efforts by his core loyalists in the People Democratic Party, PDP, to dissuade him from joining the APC and running on its platform, saying that such would be detrimental to opposition party and belittling of his image.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nJonathan has not committed himself to 2023 race; buying forms in ex-President\u2019s name, an insult \u2014 Aide\n\nAccording to a reliable source, the former president had concluded plans to accept the nomination form and meet with the APC leadership since Sunday morning but was strongly prevailed upon by those seen as his \u2018inner caucus friends\u2019 to shelve the move and remain in the PDP even without being active in the party.\n\n\u201cThese people have been pressurizing Jonathan until the very last minute not to accept to run on the APC ticket no matter how tempting the conditions may be. That was why the former president did not present himself to the APC National chairman on Sunday when the form was to be formally presented to him by the Almajiri who want to show him appreciation for what he did for them during his tenure by building schools and rehabilitating them,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cThe main argument of those opposed to Jonathan running on the APC ticket is that it would be belittling to his image and standing in the world for him to do so given where he had been and what he represents as a former president of Nigeria. But the point is that the deadline for picking the form is this week and if he does not accept the form, the window would be closed and the opportunity lost,\u201d one source explained.\n\n\u201cThat was why the former president had to meet Adamu last night and their meeting was very productive as both men came out happily at the end of the one-hour meeting in Adamu\u2019s house in Abuja,\u201d the source explained.\n\nIt will be recalled that following the purchase of the form for Jonathan, his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, had described the action as insulting and unacceptable to Jonathan, saying that he was not consulted.\n\nBut a close source confirmed last night that Jonathan was moving ahead with the plan to run on the APC ticket.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has called for prayers and support of Nigerians to enable him succeed on the task ahead of him\n\nAdamu, represented by the Speaker of Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi, at the APC Stakeholders valedictory session in Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone harped on unity of party members noting that that APC would provide a level playing ground for all its aspirants at the forth coming primary elections.\n\nThe APC chairman urged aspirants to accept the outcome of the forth coming primaries in good faith, unite and work for the success of the party beyond 2023, assured that the party will provide a level playing ground for all.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to all aspirants to accept the results of the primary election in good faith and not to leave the party but stay to build it to succeed and rule beyond 2023. There is surely a reward for every loyal party member.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nHealthcare professionals have called for massive awareness and management of rheumatoid arthritis to prevent disease progression, stating that early diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment improve clinical outcomes for patients with the disease.\n\nThe autoimmune experts who spoke during a virtual media roundtable hosted by Pfizer Biopharmaceutical on the \u2018Prevalence and Social Burden of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Nigeria\u2019 said the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, is ideally done as soon as the patient starts with disease symptoms in order to get the disease into remission or have minimal signs and symptoms.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small joints of the body. Patients with the disorder present with pain, stiffness and warmth of the affected joints and the disease may lead to disability or premature death, if not treated early and appropriately.\n\nSharing medical insights on the condition, a Consultant rheumatologist, Dr Hakeem Olaosebikan, at the Lagos State University College of Medicine, explained that early management and treatment would decrease the progression of joint disease as the disease process can cause progressive damage to joints with resultant loss of function, which in many patients, will mean that they are unable to fulfil work obligations or cope with activities at home.\n\nHe said adequate treatment is also important to try to prevent or lessen the severity of co-morbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease, a major cause of mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \u201cApart from treating the rheumatoid disease, the patient should ideally be treated by a multidisciplinary team to address many other associations of this disease which range from psychological help with anxiety and depression to guidance with physical therapy by physiotherapists or biokineticists and help with activities of daily living by occupational therapists.\u201d Olaosebikan said it had become imperative to raise awareness about rheumatology, as well as, enlighten the public about the management of rheumatoid arthritis as the commonest autoimmune arthritis in Nigeria.\n\nHe disclosed that one or two patients are diagnosed weekly with the disease in most tertiary hospitals.\n\nHe said the disease poses physical, psychological, and economic burdens for affected patients, their families and the healthcare system. Olaosebikan urged the government to focus on the disease, stressing the need to evolve and pass patient-friendly legislatures.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to reduce calorie and salt intake, maintain a healthy weight, avoid smoking and ensure regular exercise to strengthen joint mobility.\n\nSpeaking, a Rheumatologist from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH, Dr. Uyiekpan Ima-Edomwonyi, said data has shown that the burden of rheumatoid arthritis would increase in most developing countries like Nigeria.\n\nHe said along with the increase in non-communicable diseases in developing countries, an increase in Rheumatoid arthritis occurrence could stress medical services to an extent that they may be unable to cope with the fast-changing patterns of disease distribution seen in Africa currently.\n\nThe Country Medical Director, Pfizer East and West Africa, Dr. Kodjo Soroh, stated that RA remains one of the most common rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the region.\n\nHe said there was hope as Pfizer is committed to raising awareness around the treatments available.\n\n\u201cWe want to work closely with the healthcare community to ensure early diagnosis, increased patient access and medication adherence. There is Project Afya, a patient assistance program aimed at improving access to life-saving medications and boosting cancer care and autoimmune disease management.\n\nIn partnership with IQVIA, the platform is helping to reduce therapy costs for eligible patients as Rheumatologists identify patients for enrolment into the programme\u201d.\n\nIma-Edomwonyi said that factors that would drive the disease burden include lifestyle, weight, smoking and alcohol consumption which predisposed to musculoskeletal disorders.",

We have to stage primaries before one becomes the candidate. You are very important to me for that. I come to unite Nigeria and not to divide Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnybody can run for the presidency but not everybody can be the President. I am extremely different from other candidates who promise fake agenda. If I become the president, I will take care of all the abandoned projects for the economic development of the country.\n\n\u201cI am contesting to change the country for good and I say you will never regret giving me your support.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, while speaking on the occasion said: \u201cthe problems of Nigeria, though many can be conquered,\u201d stating that the APC National Leader has the leadership capacity to help Nigeria overcome them.\n\nIn his words: \u201cthe world is full of history of many countries, leaders, who came saw and conquered. So, it is doable. It is possible but we have to have the right leader to do that and l I am sure of Asiwaju. His credentials speaks for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe many people he has brought into this party, were what we used to call his own boys of 20 years ago but today they are leaders calling the shorts in various fields.\n\n\u201cHe is the first to come to us. Many will come. We are going to receive and listen to them as members of APC because at the end of the exercise, we want APC to move as one solid force to deliver in 2023, from the state to the federal. We will welcome everybody. We will talk to them but we know where we are.

Indeed, your developmental strides needs to be replicated in Nigeria.\n\nWith these qualities alone, you have our blessings, cooperation and support ahead of the forthcoming National party primaries to make you come out successful and as a gift for Nigerians come 2023.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I will say welcome home the Asiwaju of Lagos, the Jagaban of Borgu and congratulations in advance his Excellency, the incoming president, Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

This was not the way things used to be I must tell you. We are tired of this hardship. What is it? Is this what they promised us in 2015?\n\n\u201cWhat was the price of petrol before the present administration came on board? They keep deceiving us, giving us empty promises.

          "text": "Airline Operators of Nigeria, AON, on Monday, accused the management of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of withholding 25,000MT of aviation fuel in disregard to the directive issued by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, the airline operators stated that President Buhari directed that aviation fuel should be sold to them at landing rates with a view to ameliorate the losses they incurred over the months.\n\nThe AON Vice President and Chairman, Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, disclosed that the Association was invited by management of Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority (NMDRA) to notify them of the President\u2019s gesture, and the need for them to nominate trusted and established oil marketers to take delivery of the 25,000 MT and sell to them at the landing rate.\n\nHe said having nominated 10 established oil marketers to take the product, he, in the presence of his members called the NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari informing him of the President\u2019s gesture and that their selected marketers would be in touch regarding the product, but he(Kyari) vehemently said no.\n\n\u201cWe were invited by the Midstream and Downstream Authority and we were told that the president approved 25,000 metric tonnes for us as a palliative to help us. We were very grateful to the president. It was not free. We were happy.\n\n\u201cWe were told to nominate marketers that would market this product for us. We were told to have a meeting with these marketers. We called all the marketers. We held a meeting with them.\n\n\u201cWe decided the logistics, so they would take their logistical costs and everything and at the end of the day that fuel was getting to them. They told us at N335, so we put everything together and it would be getting to less than N400 for the cost and we said even if they sell to us at N450 it would be okay.\n\n\u201cWe were told that a week later that is when the consignment would be arriving Nigeria and when this happened, the next we got to hear from the marketers was that they had already been given the consignment that we were all jostling for. So we waited thinking that they would sell as agreed. They never are.\n\n\u201cI actually called the MD of NNPC, in the presence of our members. We wanted to hear from him. He answered that there was no way they would leave us to get direct products that were dangerous.\n\n\u201cBut I said no, that the marketers you are going to give are the same marketers that would handle it for us. He (Melee Kyari) said he did not want any crash or anybody adulterating it.\n\n\u201cI said how could they adulterate it because they are the same marketers. We are not taking it on our own. Long and short of the story is that this product was not given to us and we noticed that it continued rising and rising,\u201d Onyema said.\n\nAlso speaking, AON President, Abdulmanaf Yunusa who doubles as Chairman of Azman Air explained that the Airline Operators begged the NNPC GMD to give the allocation approved by the President for them to the nominated marketers.\n\nIn his response, the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari said there are considered safety issues involved in releasing aviation fuel directly to operators, or even marketers, saying that not everyone can handle ATK.\n\n\u201cRt Hon Speaker it is more complex than they say. Somebody must handle aviation fuel. We cannot surrender the safety of Nigerians to just anyone. It is not every marketing company that can handle ATK including",

          "text": "The embattled member of the House of Representatives, Farah Dagogo, has accused the Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, of bias following his claims on circumstances that led to his arrest and detention.\n\nEboka, on a television programme, narrated the circumstances that led to Dagogo\u2019s detention.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn April 27, during screening for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for House of Assembly and House of Representatives, about 30 boys stormed the venue with weapons like daggers, cutlass, axes, and they were singing cult songs. Some of them were saying no Farah, no screening, no Farah, no PDP.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting indiscriminately. Our men on ground had to chase them and about 15 were arrested. Their behaviour that day and the fact that they were mentioning Farah made the governor declare him wanted.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of their (Wike and Farah) political differences. We are not here for politics. We are fighting crime and criminality. We cannot watch people come to a gathering and start shooting indiscriminately, disrupting the process.\n\n\u201cThe following day, Farah came to the same venue; he was identified and arrested based on what happened the previous day. We invited him, told him what happened, but he refused to make any statement. He also refused to call his lawyer. We then prepared charges and took him to court the following day.\u201d\n\nBut Dagogo\u2019s media aide, Ibrahim Lawal, countered Eboka\u2019s account, insisting there was no incident by any member of the public on April 27 as the screening went smoothly and was concluded the next day.\n\nLawal said the sporadic gunshots witnessed on that day were fired by the policemen who were harassing and molesting party faithful who came to support the aspirants.\n\nHe said: \u201cDr. Farah Dagogo is a governorship aspirant and was never at the venue for the screening of National and State Assembly aspirants. The 15 persons the CP claimed were arrested as cultists have since been interrogated and charged to court, our lawyers are privy to their statements.\n\n\u201cNone of them mentioned Dagogo as the one who brought them to the secretariat. They explained their presence to the police in their statements that they are party faithful, who went there to support their aspirants. Again, Farah Dagogo is not an aspirant for those positions.\u201d\u201d\n\nLawal also said Eboka didn\u2019t invite Dagogo, and challenged him to present proof of the invitation. He said Eboka did not disclose the fact that he had a telephone conversation with Dagogo few minutes before he went to the screening venue, and that he told the lawmaker that Governor Nyesom Wike had no powers to declare him wanted.\n\nThe media aide asked Eboka to provide evidence to justify his claims that the 30 boys stormed the venue with weapons.\n\nHe appealed to the Inspector-General of Police to begin investigation into the circumstances that led to Dagogo\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u201cDr. Dagogo\u2019s health condition is now perilous. A request from the personal physician to the lawmaker for a referral to another medical facility was thwarted by the the Rivers State government through its Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice. Dr. Dagogo is a responsible lawmaker and he is entitled to adequate medical care,\u201d he added.",

This us the way to decentralise power sharing for equity and justice.\u201d\n\nThe governor spoke on insecurity in Imo, maintaining that the violence has political connotations.\n\nHe said the insecurity in the state was being fuelled by political opponents who have an axe to grind with his administration.\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for lending assistance to his administration to tackle the crises.\n\nUzodinma said it is not every time states should run to the Federal Government for solutions to local security matters.\n\nHe added: \u201cStates,as component units of the federation shoukd be able to deal with local security challenges, although the police, the army, Navy, airforce and other security agencies belong to the Federal Government. But, President Buhari is trying for us.\n\n\u201cThe inter-agency cooperation in Imo ranks among the best. It should be emulated by other states. We want to prevent killings. No more compensation. It will not help. No compensation can equal the life of a person. Who benefits from the compensation? Not those killed. Therefore, we want to prevent killings.\u201d",

A9, LFN, 2004, which guarantees the right of every Nigerian to free access to participate directly in the government of the country.\n\nThe relevant sections of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) clearly outlined the criteria for qualification to contest for various elective political offices in Nigeria either at the Federal or State level, and nothing in those provisions requires payment of nomination fees by candidates or authorises political parties to levy any fees on aspirants for procurement of nomination forms.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the sponsorship and nomination of candidates for election though being a matter seemingly within the purview of a political party\u2019s internal affairs, the court has the jurisdiction to strike down such exercise of a party\u2019s right when it violates the law and/or the Constitution.",

          "text": "Former Sokoto State Commissioner for Finance, Hon. Abdussamad Dasuki, has formally handed over the Ministry to the Permanent Secretary, Dahiru Balarabe Abbas.At the handover ceremony were the Accountant General, Umar B. Balarabe; Deputy Accountant General, Musa Mohammad Maccido; Director Debt Management, Murtala Umar Dogondaji; and Director Funds, Aliyu Abubakar Dange.\n\nDasuki who took over the affairs of the Ministry in 2019, had earlier tendered his resignation in March in compliance with the Electoral Act. He recently returned from a foreign trip to formally hand over to the permanent secretary.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, the former commissioner extolled Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal\u2019s sterling leadership, which has placed Sokoto in good stead for rapid growth and development.\n\nDasuki, who is the Santuraki of Sokoto, said with the prudent management of the resources of the state by the Tambuwal administration, the laudable reforms executed by the finance ministry and the various Legacy projects across the state, Sokoto was better positioned to compete favorably for investments and to meet the aspirations of its people.\n\nThe former commissioner said he feels fulfilled that he was handing over a reformed ministry that played a key role in the various reforms executed by the Tambuwal administration. He said with the reforms initiated and executed, the Finance Ministry was adequately prepared to continue to lead the way in the development agenda of the state government.\n\nHe recalled that at the inception of the Tambuwal administration, government finances were at the lowest ebb due to low FAAC Inflow, weak Internal Revenue Generation, abandoned and unpaid capital projects, and gratuity liabilities.\n\n\u201cIt was these and many others that the government had to grapple with at inception,\u201d he said, adding that the Ministry of Finance, whose sole responsibility is the management of public finance, disbursement, execution of financial policies and management of public debt and securities, was consequently saddled with the responsibility of reversing this ugly trend.\n\n\u201cFaced with these challenges, he said the Tambuwal administration came up with strategies to reform the public finance to ensure prudent management of resources, blocked loopholes in the state payroll and instituted a regime of transparency and accountability in public finance.\n\nDasuki said those reforms boosted the state\u2019s cash inflow and paved way for the provision of developmental projects across Sokoto.\n\nHe said the reforms of the state finances also received recognitions from major institutions, including a grant of $33m in three years and expecting another $22m before the end of 2022 from the World Bank for the commitment to the implementation of the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability (SFTAS) programme following its impressive score in the SFTAS ranking so far, placing it among the top three states in the country to achieve such ranking.\n\nSokoto also emerged first among the 36 states and FCT in the paying taxes column of the Subnational Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Baseline Survey as announced by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC).\n\nHe also listed the enactment of the harmonized Consolidated Revenue Law of 2019, which has helped the state to raise its IGR by 97 per cent.\n\nOther achievements of the ministry, according to Dasuki, include: continued automation of revenue processes; establishment of revenue codes for the state and all the 23 local governments; establishment of Single Treasury Account (TSA); Adoption of Cash Management Strategy; Adoption of Monthly Debt Arrears Clearance Framework on Contract and Gratuity payments; Establishment of SFTAS Secretariat; provision of utility vehicles, motor cycles, office furniture, ICT facilities and equipment; and construction of an ultramodern Revenue House and Complex.\n\nOthers include harmonizing state civil service database; sanitizing the state civil service salary and pension by linking BVN to personnel management data; provision of adequate manpower and ICT facilities for the salary department; training and retraining of staff for better output and performance; and implementations of N18,000 and subsequently N30,000 minimum wage and CONPCASS salary scale of tertiary institutions for civil servants, thus emerging as the only state in the Northwest that has been consistent with the payment of new minimum wage and with zero salary and pension arrears.\n\nDasuki also listed the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Agency Law 2020 and constitution of its board; migration from Cash Basis Accounts to IPSAS Cash and later Accrual Basis ISPAS; and monthly payment of subsistence allowance to both foreign and local students and also cleared arrears of tuition fees.\n\nThe former commissioner thanked Governor Tambuwal for the opportunity to serve at the helm of affairs of the finance ministry for three years, adding that he is confident that the achievements recorded by the ministry has placed Sokoto on the front row of states that has reformed their finance sector for optimal performance.\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am most glad because he is from the North-east, the only zone alongside South-east that is yet to produce president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained an unambiguous stand that for justice, equity and fairness in our country, the next president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari should come from the South-east or the North-east.\n\n\u201cI have also told Nigerians that I would only run for president if the two major political parties (APC and PDP) zone their tickets to the South-east.\n\n\u201cThat is why I was disappointed with our southern brothers who are talking about fairness and equity but has zero tolerance for the same fairness and equity in the South.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a South-easterner being president of Nigeria in 2023, I have my full support for a North-easterner. This is because it would be the closest to the equity, fairness and justice everyone is talking about.

          "text": "\n\n*In apparent double standard, activists, Akeredolu, PDP, Tambuwal, Ezekwesili, others keep mum as Adesina fails to resign after his proxies purchased forms for him\n\n*Action Alliance, group fault calls for Emefiele\u2019s sack\n\n*Insist CBN governor has not breached any law\n\n\n\nGoddy Egene in Lagos, Sunday Aborisade and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nSome African leaders have mounted pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to anoint President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election, THISDAY learnt at the weekend.\n\n\n\nA reliable source told THISDAY that leaders in West Africa, including the presidents of Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, might have spoken to Buhari on behalf of the AfDB president. The West African leaders are meeting Buhari in Abidjan today and tomorrow, at a two-day conference organised by the United Nations, on the future of land, regarding desertification, drought, degradation, rights, restoration and implications for national and world economies.. Their mission? To try and persuade him to consider Adesina. This, it was gathered, was what encouraged a coalition of support groups to purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms for the president of the continental bank.\n\n\n\nHowever, analysts described as double standard the calls on Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to resign over the purchase of the N100 million APC nomination and expression of interest forms on his behalf by his supporters, while keeping mum on the purchase of the forms for Adesina.\n\n\n\nThe analysts specifically accused the Governors of Ondo and Sokoto States, Rotimi Akeredolu and Aminu Tambuwal; the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Oby Ezekwesili, and other activists who have been calling on Emefiele to resign, without demanding same from Adesina who superintends over a continental bank.\n\n\u201cThe APC forms have been purchased for Adesina, why are they not calling for his resignation as well?\u201d the analyst who pleaded to remain anonymous wondered.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu had while reacting to the purchase of the N100 million All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination and expression of interest forms on behalf of Emefiele for the 2023 presidential election, last Friday, said the CBN Governor should resign his position or be sacked.\n\n\n\nOn her part, Nigeria\u2019s former Minister of Education, Ezekwesili as well as some activist on Twitter and other social media platforms had also called on Emefiele to resign.\n\nThree different groups, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Friends of Emefiele and Emefiele Support Group, had last week, purchased the forms for Emefiele.\n\n\n\nThey noted that the apex bank\u2019s boss was the only responsible and responsive person to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari at the 2023 general elections, hence their decision to purchase the forms for him.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of Action Alliance (AA), Kenneth Udeze, has disagreed with Akeredolu, over his call for the sack of Emefiele.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, the Ideas Nigeria Movement (INM), a group of Nigerians with focus on national unity, innovation and capacity also described as baseless, calls by various persons and associations for Emefiele to resign his position.\n\n\n\nResponding to the calls for the CBN governor to vacate his position, Udeze, in a statement yesterday, in Abuja, alleged that Akeredolu\u2019s anger against Emefiele was beyond the issue of the purchase of form.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany participants and watchers of the democratic space must have been taken aback by the speed and audacity at which the Ondo State Governor came down hard on Emefiele.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is more surprising that Akeredolu spoke at a time when Emefiele has not even come out to declare that he has interest and he will be running.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the groups that felt that the CBN Governor will do well as the president purchased forms for him but he has not made any declaration.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, Nigerians will naturally want to ask the Ondo Governor on which basis is he asking for Emefiele\u2019s sacking?\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cFor the discerning minds, Akeredolu\u2019s call is beyond politics or national interest. It is purely personal.\n\n\u201cI am however advising Nigerians to beware of desperate politicians who will be presenting their personal interests as national interest as we move closer to the general election.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a related development, the INM, in a statement issued by its Executive Secretary, Mallam Nadodo Abubakar, yesterday, stressed that Emefiele has not breached any law, especially the constitution, hence should not resign.\n\nThe INM wondered why some persons were still calling on Emefiele to resign even when he had rejected the form and was yet to declare his intent to run, stressing that, \u201cEmefiele as at today has not breached any extant law of the land.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe statement added: \u201cEven by his own admission, the CBN Governor has not formerly declared his intent to contest for the Presidential ticket of any party, yet certain persons are already calling for his head or his resignation while some are threatening to shut down the nation through protests.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe dare say that these reactions are baseless, ultra vires and of no effect as they are based on hearsay and the actions of some Nigerians (not Emefiele) who are working at convincing Emefiele to join the presidential race.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore wrong and unjustifiable for critics of Emefiele to continue to demand for his resignation when the man, himself, has not officially declared his intention to run.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe admit that several groups including professional bodies have since mounted pressure on Emefiele to contest the Presidency, such persuasions were only vicarious and do not represent his opinion or intendment. Even so, these groups were only persuading Mr. Emefiele to exercise his constitutional rights and liberties.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the INM faulted critics who were referencing the Public Service Rules, CBN Act and the 1999 Constitution to advance their argument, adding that quoting laws would not be enough, but showing proof of how his \u201caction or inaction offends any of the statutes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is clear on the matter of who should resign and when to resign in the case of appointees seeking election to political offices. While ruling on the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State capital, held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution. \u201cThis ruling renders nugatory any other law, rule or Act of Parliament stipulating that appointees must resign ahead of the primary elections of their preferred party.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven if we assume, though not conceding, that Emefiele is running, he has not contravened any of the afore-listed canons often quoted by his traducers. For the avoidance of doubt, Emefiele has not breached any law.\n\n\u201cHe has not shown any partisanship, neither has he mounted any rostrum nor undertaken any tour across the land to woo delegates of any political party.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery perceived political activity being linked to Emefiele was done by different groups who merely made persuasive efforts to compel him to run for Presidency on account of his antecedents as someone who believes in promoting a production economy as opposed to a consumption economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is no brainer that Emefiele remains the best CBN governor who has genuinely placed the nation on the path of economic diversification through a revolutionary turnaround of the agriculture ecosystem. Little wonder, farmers were the ones who enthusiastically purchased Form on his behalf but which he has rejected, according to his tweet.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe reaffirm that Emefiele should not resign because he has not flouted any law. We recall that the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia has effectively struck out Section 84(12) of the newly amended Electoral Act,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\n\nThe group stressed that it was \u201cshocked that a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, should join the anti-Emefiele mob to demand for his resignation based on blatant falsehood and hearsay.\n\n\n\n\u201cEmefiele has openly told the world that he has not consented to the request of some patriots especially Nigerian farmers to run but would rather prefer to be Divinely guided on the matter, which he referred to as a \u2018serious decision.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe urge Emefiele to stay focused on the good job he is doing at CBN where he has guided the nation\u2019s economy out of two recessions, navigated the economic landmines of Covid-19 pandemic which consumed stronger economies in the advanced West,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCoalition: N100m Presidential Form Purchased But Adesina Not Persuaded\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of support groups that purchased the presidential nomination form for President of the African Development Bank, Akinwunmi Adesina, has lamented that it has not been able to convince him to contest the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary election.\n\n\n\nAt the weekend, the coalition of 28 support groups had paid for his presidential nomination form.\n\nWhile addressing journalists in Abuja, yesterday, the President of One Nigeria Group, Mohammed Saleh, said their quest to seek a solution to the myriad of challenges confronting the country informed their decision to drag him into the race.\n\n\n\nHe described Adesina as a man of proven integrity and experience, saying he performed well for Nigeria as Minister for Agriculture.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has solved the problems of so many farmers, created so many jobs by solving the corruption in the agricultural sector. Particularly the fertilizer, which he brought the e-wallet for fertilizer which the farmers are enjoying now, and it has created a lot of jobs,\u201d Saleh explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has also helped millions of farmers in Nigeria, which they are still benefiting from and also as president of African Development Bank, he has brought a lot of initiatives that solve Africa\u2019s food security problem. So, we will like him to come back home and apply it here in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn how Adesina would woo delegates to vote for him, he noted that the most important thing for the group now was to get Adesina to agree to join the race.\n\n\u201cWhen we get there, we\u2019ll cross that bridge, don\u2019t worry about that. First and foremost, the most significant thing is for us to get him to agree and come and collect the form, sign it for us and then join the race. That is the most significant thing at the moment,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cIssues of delegates and everybody I know all Nigerians apart from not even the delegates even you, everybody in Nigeria knows that Adesina has the capacity to bring Nigeria back from the brink.\u201d\n\nAlso, the leader and founder of the Youth Arise Movement, Babatunde Ademola, said he was one of the group leaders working tirelessly and consulting across the country and even outside the country to ensure that they get him to come and obey the clarion call.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will tell you significantly that we have tried to reach out to him. We have sent messages. We have not gotten any definite response from him,\u201d explained Ademola. \u201cWe need Dr Adesina to come and solve Nigeria\u2019s problem, and because of this, we have put our resources together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to gather N100 million, but we have ensured that we gather as many people as possible. So we are calling him to come out and accept this form from us,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIs a gift to serve this country and solve our problems. We are calling Adesina because it\u2019s a call to save Nigeria, and I think he is going to accept.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "\u201cThe future will have no pity for those men who, possessing the exceptional privilege of being able to speak words of truth to their oppressors, have taken refuge in an attitude of passivity, of mute indifference, and sometimes of cold complicity.\u201d\u2014Frantz Fanon.\n\nThe transmogrification of Nigeria into a captive state, a century-long process embarked upon prior to the fusion of the northern and southern protectorates appears to have reached its plastic point in recent years. In physics, the plastic point is one wherein an elastic wire would cease to return to its original length upon stretching. With the spate of unabated killings and stomach politicking, nationals await the miracle their leaders would deplore to remove Nigeria from the parlous position it currently occupies.\n\nFrom Nigeria down to Zimbabwe, India through Pakistan, the notoriety of the British never to forget to leave a problem in every country she colonized for them to chew until eternity continues to remain a formidable platform upon which the cracks in those nations manifest. Sadly for Africa, the actors who fought under the siege of Black Nationalism reclaimed their lands only to replace white supremacy with tribal bigotry, a volte-face amongst these scorched-earth creatures whose touted intelligence, sophistication and power of reasoning cease to function once the double-faced weaponry of religion and ethnicity is bandied right to their very faces!\n\nModiu Olaguro Their diverse nature, rich histories and alluring cultures\u2014powerful combos whose nuances ought to be recognised, respected and brought together to forge an indomitable front have but become the major fulcrum upon which all manner of division and hate is spewed, an unfortunate reality which signals to the correctness of the words of the black existentialist philosopher and pragmatic revolutionary, Frantz Fanon that \u201cnational consciousness is nothing but a crude, empty fragile shell. The cracks in it explain how easy it is for young independent countries to switch back from nation to ethnic group and from state to tribe\u2014a regression which is so terribly detrimental and prejudicial to the development of the nation and national unity.\u201d\n\nIt is this rapid switch to our parochial instincts that has reduced the country to a big-for-nothing giant, a condition exacerbated by our embrace of a \u201clootocratic\u201d form of government as against a flourishing one, with very little to show for the massive wealth buried beneath the soil, rarities on top of it and most damning, the brilliant ideas within the skull of the people. With a switch so inimical to national progress and the spirit of Pan Africanism, character, merit and justice have got to make way for federal character and all what's not, creating an atmosphere wherein persons whose belief system bars them from loving life deny others their fair share of it.\n\nWhile the masses keep bickering amongst themselves over the terror of the herdsmen, fellow nationals from northern Nigeria whose detest for criminality is an open book have since been in a fix over the questioning of their loyalty as they grapple with an emotional nation which has succeeded, to the dismay of logic and reason, at reducing the glaring failure of leadership and an over-centralization of security apparatuses to an act of ethnic expansionism! With this mindset, the masses deny themselves core sympathizers on the other side of the divide at best, and at worst, play into the hands of an overt bigot, whose trifling use of \u201cmy fellow citizens\u201d is at variance with his sectional outlook and a lack of appreciation of the richness in people beyond his parochial subconscious, with neither age nor ascension to the highest office to preside over the affairs of a multifarious nation having any effect on his person.\n\nWith Nigeria, one cannot be too surprised on the sound of a barrel or the sight of a club. But recent events, which culminated in the making of the middle belt into a vast morgue and the rest of the country, a hellish abode have further thrust the nation on the brink of collapse. These further reinforce my position that should Nigerians not wake up from their collective slumber by first recognizing that the only enemy they have got are the characters that make up the rank and file of the leadership cadre, redefine their country and situate their place in it, our slip into anomie would only intensify.\n\nA place to begin is the kind of country we all desire to live in. It is the propounding of such a vision that has made the American, America; the French, France; and the Russian, Russia; with these nations having sons and daughters who embody in totality, the aspirations and yearnings of their respective lands\u2014not hesitating whatsoever to live or die for their countries in the furtherance of such noble ideals.\n\nOne clarity in the Nigerian state is the rarity of statemen\u2014men and women whose duties lie, strictly, in the promotion and propagation of the common good. From the north down south, through the trenches of delta, the nation longs for a father. It is this absence of a national patriarch that has made way for all manner of charlatans and opportunists to abrogate such tasking responsibility to themselves, audacious among them being ex-president Obasanjo, the impish general whose continued relevance in the public space is tied to the chronic affliction of collective forgetfulness amongst the people on one side, and the very position the country occupies as a failed state on the other.\n\nWith the call for restructuring exceeding the desirable decibels since the days of the inept and corrupt administration of Goodluck Jonathan and raging with fire and brimstone since the pretentious and complicit presidency of Muhammadu Buhari, the debate on the sustainability of the Lugardian project has never been this visible on the spot. The nation more than ever needs brave men who are certain of their convictions to put forward viable alternatives and defend their arguments with uncommon bravado.\n\nRestructuring or otherwise, it would not require much from men with convictions to recognise that irrespective of the structure or system of government we adopt as a people, our entanglement with the hefty baggage of official corruption and treachery would remain until the masses realise their place within the space they call theirs, fashion their country in line with the vision so conceived and put structures in place for the sustenance and continuation of such.\n\nThe shirking away from this noble venture of statehood stands as the greatest stumbling block against our longing to make a nation from Nigeria, with everyone caught up in the web of hate and individualism while the unfortunate, albeit succinct words of the respected premier of the defunct western region, Chief Awolowo of Nigeria not being a country but a mere geographical expression continue to remain as the most fitting descriptor of our nation several decades later.\n\nUntil the masses themselves realise, paraphrasing Kwame Ture, that there is a higher law than the law of a hypocrite named Obasanjo, a higher law than the law of a bigot named Buhari, and a much higher one than those made by the tools in the national assembly, the leadership space would continue to remain an abode for self-acclaimed democrats whose motive for venturing into politics is strictly to steal, kill and destroy.\n\nWith 19% (16 million) of the total workforce unemployed and 21% (18 million) underemployed according to the Q3 2017 Employment By Sector Report of the National Bureau of Statistics; 1 in 5 children dying before the age of five according to the World Health Organisation and an unacceptable fatality rate amongst child bearers, Nigerians must stop being accomplices to the subjugation of their existence by their fellow citizens.\n\nGoing by the level of rot and the very fact that the nation keeps going adrift, hope appears to have eluded this generation. Will the people throw their hats in the ring to salvage the next?\n\nModiu Olaguro can be reached on [email protected]",

          "title": "Reps ask NNPC to provide 6m litres of aviation fuel to airline operators",
          "text": "The house of representatives has asked the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to provide six million litres of aviation fuel to marketers chosen by the airline operators.\n\nIt was part of the resolutions reached after meeting with the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) and other stakeholders on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) announced plans to shut down operations from Monday over the high cost of aviation fuel.\n\nThe group complained that aviation fuel, also known as Jet A1, has reached an all-time high of N700 per litre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of the resolutions, it was also agreed that, as a long-term solution, the airline operators must commence, the process of securing a license for the importation of aviation fuel to avoid suspicion over the landing cost of the product and other associated logistic issues.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, Allen Onyema, vice-president of AON, said the scarcity can be addressed if airliners are allowed to purchase aviation fuel directly.\n\n\u201cWe were told here at that last meeting that fuel would be sold to us at N500 which we protested that it was still on the high side because even when fuel was selling at N200 or N250, the operating cost was about 40 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt rose to N400 and N450, and that was when we were alarmed, and you noticed that everybody tweaked his inventory when we now raised our base fare to about N50,000, which did not address the matter.\n\n\u201cWe were invited to the house, and when we came here, it was reached that they would give us fuel at N500 within three days. That never happened. We continued writing, and nothing happened.\n\n\u201cMuch later, we were invited by the midstream and downstream authority and we were told that the president approved 25,000 metric tonnes for us as a palliative to help us. We were very grateful to the president. We were happy. We were told to nominate marketers that would market this product for us.\n\n\u201cWe were told to have a meeting with these marketers. We called all the marketers and held a meeting with them. We decided the logistics, so they would take their logistical costs and everything, and at the end of the day that fuel was getting to them, they told us at N335, so we put everything together, and it would be getting to less than N400 for the cost, and we said even if they sell to us at N450 it would be okay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were told that a week later that is when the consignment would be arriving in Nigeria and when this happened, the next we got to hear from the marketers was that they had already been given the consignment that we were all jostling for. So we waited thinking that they would sell as agreed. They never.\u201d\n\nOnyema said the matter was reported to Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cI called the MD of NNPC in the presence of our members.

That never happened. We continued writing, and nothing happened.\n\n\u201cMuch later, we were invited by the midstream and downstream authority and we were told that the president approved 25,000 metric tonnes for us as a palliative to help us. We were very grateful to the president. We were happy. We were told to nominate marketers that would market this product for us.\n\n\u201cWe were told to have a meeting with these marketers. We called all the marketers and held a meeting with them. We decided the logistics, so they would take their logistical costs and everything, and at the end of the day that fuel was getting to them, they told us at N335, so we put everything together, and it would be getting to less than N400 for the cost, and we said even if they sell to us at N450 it would be okay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were told that a week later that is when the consignment would be arriving in Nigeria and when this happened, the next we got to hear from the marketers was that they had already been given the consignment that we were all jostling for. So we waited thinking that they would sell as agreed. They never.\u201d\n\nOnyema said the matter was reported to Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cI called the MD of NNPC in the presence of our members.

          "text": "Tunde Bakare, serving overseer of The Citadel Global Community Church, says the N100 million paid for the All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination and expression of interest forms was from his account.\n\nBakare, who made an official declaration on his presidential bid on Monday, picked the forms on May 5.\n\nSpeaking on Monday in an interview with Channels Television, the cleric said he didn\u2019t expect the forms to cost more than N50 million, but said he understood that the price is part of efforts to make the party \u201cformidable\u201d.\n\n\u201cTalking of the cost, there is a price to pay for everything. I was not part of the decision making process, but if I\u2019m going to apply for anything and they say this is the way to go about it, the price has to be paid. It is like going to a school or university; you pay a fee,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo I consider that fee or cost very cheap? Not at all. Not in the least. Just as everything in life that is highly valued comes with a price, that was the price the party fixed and those who want to join will have to pay the same price.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, we paid without having to borrow or beg. God Almighty, who had provided, is still providing and He will continue to provide. And it is not money thrown away; this is part of the investment in a party that needs resources to actually be a formidable party.\n\n\u201cI remember sharing with some people that in 2015, when the president contested the first time, the form was about N30 million. This time around, PDP fixed N40 million; I was expecting that the form would not be more than N50 million, but when they doubled the price, whatever is worth it because this is the time to step in and begin to make a difference. We had to comply by paying the price.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBakare also said his interest in the presidency is based on personal conviction about his capability to serve Nigeria well if he is elected.\n\n\u201cThere was a former senator from Kaduna state who said Bakare has gone quiet since N100 million is mentioned because he could not afford it. I don\u2019t trade insults with people. I just did what I needed to do \u2014 spoke against \u2014 but had to comply until we make a difference,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLook at the price Christ paid. He left the whole of heaven and the glory of heaven to come to the earth to pay a huge price in order to save mankind. To birth a new nation, to serve in a way that will raise standards and at the same time make life more comfortable for others, you will have to go through pain.\n\n\u201cMoney is the easy thing to trade. Yes, by the grace of God, we paid. Don\u2019t forget that there are so many people who are even willing to pay on our behalf and so many people will give towards it and have given towards it. But whatever was transferred to the party\u2019s account came from my account.\u201d",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nLast Saturday, I saw Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. And the Scarlet Witch\u2019s \u2014 Wanda Maximoff \u2014 desire reminds me of how far we can go to accomplish something if our desires or interests are strong enough.\n\nEven though desires or dreams are important, action is even more crucial because they make our dreams a reality. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll know that Wanda worked hard to make her dream a reality \u2014 or not.\n\nSo, let\u2019s act! Yes, I understand the importance of money. However, in some cases, you can start with the resources you have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may be doing something, and it appears that the world isn\u2019t paying attention \u2014 which can be discouraging \u2014 but believe me when I say that the world is. The universe is taking notice, and if you remain consistent, your efforts will be rewarded. So, this week, do more and speak less.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFred Agbata\u2019s appointment in South-East Nigeria\n\nIncrease in call, data and SMS rates\n\nWhatsApp\u2019s new features\n\nFred Agbata\u2019s appointment in South-East Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Governor of Anambra State in Nigeria, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, recently announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year term.\n\nWhat will he be doing? He\u2019s expected to use his experience to assist the government in realising its plans to build a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and helping state-based technology startups.\n\nWhy? Agbata has over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in various roles in the media and startup space, which he believes will serve him well as he embarks on a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIs this possible? For more information, click here: Can Anambra State spearhead a digital revolution in South-East Nigeria with Fred Agbata\u2019s appointment?\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nIncrease in call, data and SMS rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelecom companies, under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), have proposed an increase in call, data and SMS tariffs.\n\nWhat does this mean for Nigerians? Essentially, Airtel, MTN, Glo, and 9mobile customers should expect a 40% increase in call and SMS rates.\n\nWhy? ALTON complained that the cost of doing business in the country had risen by 40%.\n\nBesides, it claimed that a 2020 economic downturn and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war have financially and negatively impacted the telecommunications industry.\n\nBut, how did the Russia-Ukraine war affect the industry? ALTON claimed that the war increased their operating expenses by 35% due to higher energy costs.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the new price? The set price for calls will be raised from \u20a66.4 to \u20a68.95, while the price cap for SMS will be raised from \u20a64 to \u20a65.61.\n\nAnyway, this development occurred as business organisations continued to devise ways to survive the country\u2019s harsh economic conditions.\n\nRemember that Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO) \u2014 in order to survive the country\u2019s harsh economic conditions \u2014 reduced its operational hours from 5 p.m. to 4 p.m. in March 2022.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, May 7, 2022, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) dismissed telecom companies\u2019 request to raise call, data, and SMS tariffs by 40%.\n\nWhy? The Commission stated that there would be no cost review in the telecom sector until empirical studies are conducted to determine whether cost increases are necessary.\n\nWhatsApp has some new features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, May 6, 2022, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s CEO, announced in a Facebook post the launch of WhatsApp\u2019s Reaction feature.\n\nWhat does this mean for WhatsApp users? This means that users can respond to messages with emojis. However, this could take several days or even weeks for the feature to become available to all users.\n\nPeople will be able to respond with six different emojis: \ud83d\udc4d, \u2764, \ud83d\ude02, \ud83d\ude2f, \ud83d\ude2d and \ud83d\ude4f.\n\nAlso, on Thursday, May 5, 2022, the company announced that the maximum size of group chats would be doubled. This increases the default maximum size of group chats from 256 to 512.\n\nAlso, users can share files up to 2GB in size, a significant increase from the previous limit of 100MB.\n\nPer a WhatsApp blog post, larger groups are being \u201cslowly\u201d rolled out, while emoji reactions and increased file size limits are making their way into the app\u2019s current version.\n\nHave we seen something like this before? Yeah. You\u2019ve probably seen the Reaction feature on Slack and Telegram. And if you\u2019re not familiar with the platforms, I believe you\u2019re familiar with other Meta platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. The feature will function similarly to Instagram and Facebook Messenger.\n\nHow can you use the feature? Just like on Instagram, you can use it by long-pressing the same message and changing the emoji or by simply clicking on the same one to remove it.\n\nYou can only add one reaction per message, and you can\u2019t hide reactions or reaction counts. Also, reactions to disappearing messages will vanish when the message vanishes.\n\nFurther, recipients may see your reaction before you remove it or if removing it fails. If removing a reaction fails, you will not be notified.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that WhatsApp announced in April 2022 that it will be rolling out a slew of new features for its users, including \u2018Community\u2019 and changes to \u2018voice call.\u2019 The voice call feature of the Facebook-backed app is already available, but the Community feature is still in development.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese three Nigerian creators Soliudeen Ogunsola, Gbadebo Bello, and Ajibola Akelebe have actively created digital content that people have used globally. Soliudeen Ogunsola is a product designer who writes down his design ideas, creates design templates, and publishes them online. Gbadebo Bello, a software engineer, expresses himself as well as the entire technical approach in his articles, which thousands of people have read. Finally, Ajibola Akelebe regards himself as a creative Visual and Brand Designer who has earned his stripes in the creation of digital content. These creators all had one thing in common \u2013 they all created content that reached global audiences in their respective niches. They also shared a stronger bond \u2013 the desire to monetize their creative works without their location being a restriction.\n\nFidia started because of the bond these three creators shared, which led to a research conducted and more creators being contacted to confirm the severity of the problem and gain a better understanding. This entire journey resulted in the creation of a long-term solution, which is now known as Fidia.\n\nExisting Solutions\n\nWith the number of startups, tools and new creators churned out regularly, the creator economy\u2019s exponential growth has never been in doubt. Due to the presence of startup giants building aggressively for some creators in this space, creator monetization isn\u2019t completely alien. With \u201csome\u201d emphasised in the previous statement, it begs the question of who are the creators not catered for in the creator economy, and why are these creators not catered for.\n\nThe sidelined emerging market of the creator economy\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that this emerging market has not been intentionally isolated, and individuals building in this space have been generous enough to make their platform as accessible as possible. But the infrastructure on which these platforms are built is the major limitation. These structures unintentionally exclude a larger portion of creators in emerging markets from using these monetisation tools, and because Stripe and Paypal do not operate in most parts of Africa, platforms built on these payment infrastructure exclude creators from the region. With African creators based in Africa accounting for a sizable portion of the creator economy, the next best option is to build a platform that is more generic and does not have the limitations that other platforms do. Fortunately, several platforms have emerged, but Fidia is one that could have a long-lasting impact on creators and bring about the long-awaited revolution.\n\nFusion, Solution and Revolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIDIA\n\nRecall the bond shared by Soliudeen Ogunsola, Gbadebo Bello, and Ajibola Akelebe \u2013 the desire to monetize their creative works without their location being a restriction. There was a fusion of interest amongst the three founders which led to the design of Fidia, Soliudeen Ogunsola, the Chief Executive Officer, described Fidia as \u201ca one-stop shop for creators to make money from what they love doing\u201d.\n\n\u201cImagine a place where creators can monetize their passion\u201d Soliudeen inferred, \u201cThat\u2019s Fidia!\u201d. Gbadebo Bello, the CTO and co-founder of Fidia, stated explicitly in an article, that \u201cFidia provides creators with a suite of toolkits aimed at empowering them.\u201d and that \u201cFidia\u2019s goal is to help creators make a living from their work.\u201d\n\nThese statements bring us to the solutions provided by Fidia, which consist of unique offerings that address most of the challenges faced by creators.\n\nThe possibility of creators receiving payment and financial support from anywhere in the world, irrespective of the creator\u2019s geographic location, with the introduction of Fidia payment links.\n\nThe ability of creators to create a one-page link-in bio website that allows them to quickly create an instant portfolio of their creative work. Fidia named this feature \u201cThe creator profile\u201d which is designed to accommodate creators\u2019 diverse interests and fan bases while also allowing them to showcase all of this in the most creative way possible.\n\nAllowing creators to support one another is another way to foster relationships among creators, Fidia successfully hacked this with the transfer feature, which is solely for cash transfers between Fidia creators.\n\nSelling digital products as a means of monetization on the platform provides creators with a way to not only showcase their work but also earn money while doing so.\n\nFidia intends not only to provide tools for creators, but also to investigate other avenues of support for creators and their creative businesses. With major plans in the works to financially support creators, these offerings are only the beginning of what this organisation has in store for the future. Though the founders\u2019 hopes for the creator economy have not been realised because it is still a work in progress. We can still imagine what this revolution will look like in the coming years, with many new platforms aggressively building and Fidia taking a step further into not just building for creators to earn money but also for them to showcase their creative works and grow their creative businesses. This clearly demonstrates that no level of creator is left out, and that the platform is as inclusive as possible. It is safe to say that the creator economy\u2019s future is bright, and that the long-awaited revolution may be just around the corner.\n\nTo find out more about Fidia, send an email at support@getfidia.com or visit https://getfidia.com/You can also follow @getfidia on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more investors embrace digital assets as a way to diversify their portfolios, Mushe (XMU), Mist (MIST) and Highstreet (HIGH) are the three cryptocurrencies that investors should consider acquiring right now. Why these three digital currencies? To start, all three tokens have experienced a good time in the market within the past couple of weeks. Mushe had the most significant price jump, with its tokens increasing by more than 400% since its presale launch on April 18. When it first hit the market, the tokens were priced at $0.005 per token. However, the price continues to rise as the date of its full launch on July 4 approaches. Both MIST and HIGH have also performed well, showing increases in the first week in May before the market-wide dips across the crypto industry.\n\nWhy you should invest in small-cap cryptocurrencies\n\nThe best time to purchase any asset is when it\u2019s low. Like stocks or properties, you buy low and either sell high or hold. With the low entry cost for small-cap cryptocurrencies like XMU, MIST and HIGH, investors can expect enormous returns as the price of the tokens continue to rise. What qualifies as a small-cap cryptocurrency? Well, these are crypto that may be brand new or have not shown their market sturdiness. This is advantageous for investors. Whereas more well-known crypto, such as Bitcoin, have been around for years, the price of owning a token is too high for the average investor. Plus, holding a fraction of a large cryptocurrency usually does not result in the same returns as owning several affordable small-cap cryptocurrencies. With small-cap tokens, investors can sell as soon as the price increases beyond their target to garner a profit or hold onto their investments for the long term.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about Mushe, MIST, and HIGH is that the tokens can be used in the metaverse. MIST Metaverse is an open-world, action, role-playing game built on the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. It is a block-chain based action RPG game centred around NFTs, staking and farming. Players can use the MIST token, the in-game utility token, for multiple functions, including purchasing NFTs or farming inside and outside the gaming universe. The NFTs in MIST are not the typical \u201ccollectable card\u201d NFTs found with other crypto but are, instead, usable and functional NFTs that can be inserted into the game and become special in-game items.\n\nHighstreet is another Play-to-Earn (P2E), open-world metaverse that incorporates shopping, gaming, NFTs, traditional brands and crypto brands within the role-playing game. Users can shop within the virtual universe using Highstreet\u2019s native token HIGH. The tokens can be used for game progression, access to special events, purchase of real estate or purchase limited-edition products in the Highstreet marketplace.\n\nBut not to be outdone by these innovative cryptocurrencies, XMU has its own suite of products offered by Mushe World to entice gamers and investors. These products include Mushe Wallet, MusheSwap (DEX) and the MusheVerse. Users will be able to use XMU tokens for all Mushe products. A bonus is that Mushe tokens are compatible with other blockchains, making them beneficial to investors, crypto enthusiasts and gamers who want to use the tokens to buy, trade, or sell in the metaverse. MusheVerse will be built on the Solana network taking advantage of its speed and scalability.\n\nHow you can invest in small-cap cryptocurrency today\n\nMushe has sold more than 49,000,000 of 116,550,000 tokens available in stage 1 of the presale. A massive success for a cryptocurrency that has been available to the public for less than a month. It is expected that the tokens will continue to gain traction ahead of its July 4 full launch. Mushe is built on the Ethereum network but will be migrating over to the Solana and Stellar networks in the near future.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration: https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "title": "Ukraine: Nigeria targets Europe gas market with Nigeria-Morocco pipelines",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nNigeria is on course to produce 1,780 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the current year, up from 1,450 billion feet in 2021, setting new prospects to supply Europe, according to report. The latest African Energy Chamber\u2019s (AEC) Q1 2022 Outlook stated that the country, with this development, is expected to be part of a potential supplier to meet demand in Europe.\n\nThis is coming at a time Russia and many other investors have expressed interest in investing in the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline project that has been on the cards since 2016, according to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva. But Russia may be a double loser as sanctions continue to applied against it, and the likely ban on its oil and gas by Europe from June 2022.\n\nNigeria and Morocco first signed the agreement on the project when King Mohammed VI visited President Muhammadu Buhari in December 2016. Besides linking the two countries, the 5,660 km (3,517 miles) pipeline is also expected to connect some other African countries to Europe.\n\n\u201cExisting producing projects and the projects currently under development in Nigeria are expected to ensure a resilient supply through 2025\u201d, the AEC Q1 2022 Outlook said.\u201cWith this portfolio, Nigeria has an advantage for Europe to look up to the West African country as a potential supplier.\u201d\n\nAddressing reporters on Monday in Abuja, Sylva reportedly said, \u201cThe Russians were with me in the office last week. They are very desirous to invest in this project and there are lots of other people who are also desirous to invest in the project.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a pipeline that is going to take our gas all through a lot of countries in Africa and also, all the way to the edge of the African continent where we can have access to the European market as well.\u201d\n\nSylva said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government hoped to, at least, kickstart the project before leaving office in May 2023.\n\nStrategic but late\n\nEnergy experts said the Russia and Ukraine conflict has shown that the conceptualized Nigeria\u2013Morocco Gas Pipeline (NMGP) project could strengthen Nigeria\u2019s economy as many European countries are shying away from Russia\u2019s energy supply.\n\nAnalysts believe that with the NMGP, Nigeria will be at an advantage with the current volatile movement in the energy world occasioned by the Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions on the former by the United States and some of its European allies.\n\nA partner at Price Water Coopers (PwC), Pedro Omontuemhen, stated that many European countries will be looking to get their gas supply elsewhere if Russia is no longer dependable. He also sees the NMGP as a national project that is good for Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserve and foreign income.\n\n\u201cTherefore when the economy is right then the project should be supported by any government that comes into power irrespective of parties, politics, and policies.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bala Zakka, Technical Director-Drill Bits, Template Design Limited wondered why it took both countries so long to \u201csee the light.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alliance between Nigeria and Morocco as far as the gas pipeline is concerned is long overdue,\u201d he stressed, adding that \u201cit is actually coming at the wrong time except if it is for future mutual benefits outside the immediate gas sales opportunities that the Russia-Ukraine crises have created.\u201d\n\nHe said both countries could have gained immensely if this project had been conceived earlier.\n\n\u201cWith the scuffle going on between Russia and Ukraine, European countries would have turned to Nigeria in particular if she had gone ahead with her Trans-Saharan gas pipeline project vision which was conceived more than four decades ago.\n\nHe however, concluded that \u201cthe Nigeria-Morocco alliance to come up with a gas pipeline project is worthy of praise and encouragement because it will spur positive changes going forward.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there is a growing concern on actions to take as the country\u2019s gas demand is majorly supplied by Russia. In her article for foreign policy: Germany Should Look to Africa for Gas, Not Russia, Vijaya Ramachandran argued that Africa is the country\u2019s best bet for an alternative source for gas.\n\nShe said Germany has boxed itself into a corner with its energy policies, especially the replacement of nuclear power with Russian gas, and does not have a lot of options. Her position supports the recent threat by Alexander Novak, Russia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, to stop natural gas exports to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\n\u201cSourcing much more gas from Africa \u2013 while also helping African countries to meet their own development goals \u2013 is something Germany and the rest of Europe can no longer ignore,\u201d she said.\n\nIncreasing supplies\n\nLast month the federal government decried the speed at which Europe has been pushing back against investment in fossil fuel, stressing that the Russia-Ukraine war has thought the world a big lesson, especially in the energy sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems we have in the sector has been investments. In the last 10 years, over $70 billion worth of investments came to Africa. But sadly less than $4 billion came to Nigeria, which is surprisingly the biggest country in Africa. If we cannot attract investments to Nigeria, you know where we are heading,\u201d Sylva told a delegation of the European Union (EU), who paid a visit to his office in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking during the courtesy call by EU ambassadors led by Samuela Isopi, Sylva said Nigeria was ready to step in as an alternative gas supplier to Europe but urged the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, Total Energies among others to scale up investments in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed at which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels. We warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy. You can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister told the delegation that the absence of fresh investment was stunting the growth of oil and gas in Nigeria and called for a change of attitude if the requests by the EU to increase supplies to Europe are to be realised.\n\n\u201cYou have been our longtime friend. As of today, our gas reserve is one of the biggest in the world. We have a proven gas reserve of 206 tcf, and if we focus on gas exploitation we can get up to 600 tcf. Nigeria is, arguably, the best territory to invest in.\n\n\u201cWe are already building gas infrastructures such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project, which is expected to take gas to Algeria, and the West Africa Gas Pipeline project designed to take gas to Morocco.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can see we are already building infrastructure that will take gas to Europe. All we need is investments. We acknowledge that there are challenges in the sector but we should partner to help solve the problems,\u201d Sylva pleaded.\n\nThe NMGP project is an offshore and onshore gas pipeline project that aims to transport Nigerian natural gas resources to Morocco via West and North Africa. As a continuation of the existing West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) between Nigeria, Benin, Togo, and Ghana, it is intended to deliver Nigeria\u2019s natural gas resources to 13 countries in West and North Africa. The project will be spread over a 25-year period with an initial estimate of over $25 billion.\n\nFindings reveal that Morocco has started providing financing or secured external funds.The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) agreed to fund 50 percent of the NMGP project\u2019s Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) Study. The multilateral development finance institution focused on Islamic finance will support the Moroccan contribution and contribute $15.5 million to the project\u2019s financing through the \u201cService Ijara\u201d operation.\n\nFor Nigeria, the IsDB will contribute $29.7 million to the FEED study, which aims to prepare the necessary studies for the gas pipeline and assist in making the final investment decision for the infrastructure project by 2023.Also, the OPEC fund for international development in September 2021 approved a $14.3 million loan to Morocco for the project.",

Farah Dagogo, before a Chief Magistrate Court in Port Harcourt, has been adjourned till May 23, 2022\n\nThe development followed the inability of the Nigeria Police, which is holding the lawmaker in custody since April 29, 2022, failed to produce him in court.\n\nAddressing journalists outside the courtroom, the state prosecutor, Chidi Eke, said he has filed fresh charges against the governorship hopeful, at the Rivers State High Court.\n\nMeanwhile, the detained PDP governorship aspirant, Hon. Dagogo, has accused Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, of plotting to nail him with falsehood.\n\nDagogo, in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt by his media aide, Ibrahim Lawal, alleged that the charges against him, which he described as trumped-up, were allegedly well calculated and masterminded by the governor and his co-conspirators, to put him away and scuttle his governorship ambition.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cGovernor Nyesom Wike, during a Thanksgiving Service in Church, confirmed our concerns and fears that the trump-up charges levelled against Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo by the governor is a well calculated attempt, masterminded by the Governor and his co-conspirators to put Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo away, and out of circulation and scuttle his governorship aspiration.\n\n\u201cAt the Thanksgiving Service, the governor admitted in public, what was being rumoured in private, that he wield lots of influence in the judiciary and as such would frustrate and prevent any bail application for Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo. We want to believe that the Judiciary remains the very hope for a fair adjudication and the coming days will tell us more.\n\n\u201cHe equally justified his illegal declaration of Hon. Dagogo as a cultist and a criminal\u2019 in conformity with his attempt to tarnish the image of the Federal Lawmaker.\n\n\u201cContrary to the misinformation the Governor peddled in the House of God, Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo is not a criminal, he has never been charged as one, neither has he been convicted of such an offense. His record remains unblemished.\n\n\u201cThe story of the Niger Delta agitation and struggle is in the public domain, and Hon.

I\u2019ll release a comprehensive video of everything that happened and the answers to questions.\n\n\u201cThat it was other pastors and politicians that wanted to bring him down. How come no name was mentioned.? I only did that cos the pressure was too much and everyone had left me to suffer alone. No support. I had to give up at that moment to have the opportunity for reinforcement,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nReacting to the trending story on Twitter, Suleman said he tweeted about \u2018End ASUU strike\u2019 on Sunday and that on Monday, he was trending.\n\nHe said his antagonists had continued to employ the same strategy at all time.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cI tweeted \u2018End ASUU strike\u2019 yesterday Sunday and today Monday I am trending on twitter.. una well done!\n\n\u201cSame strategy all the time. You guys should had done this at least a week later to avoid traces. END ASUU STRIKE!\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday, Otobo said Suleman did everything to stop her music music career, as he was scared that she would be influential.\n\nShe alleged that Suleman even poisoned her, paid her friends to set her up and bribed some members of her family to assassinate her.\n\n\u201cHe lured me to come make false confession at his church in Auchi that I lied against him. Apostle Johnson Suleman tried using police to shut me up because I visited Nigeria to do feature Timaya in a song. I already paid Clarence Peters for the visuals of the song before oga arrested me, cos I refused to obey him to go back to Canada. He wanted me to amount to nothing.\n\n\u201cSome people kept on wondering why I came out exposing Apostle Johnson Suleman, and why I haven\u2019t let go ever since. The truth is that, I never planned to. He pushed me to the wall and the only way I could fight back was to cry out and made everything known. The devil smiles,\u201d she alleged.\n\nOtobo also released a rising dick which she claimed was that of Suleman\n\n\u201cIf the dick pic isn\u2019t his, what is he gonna say about the scar oh his left thigh? His wife can\u2019t deny that scar. How did I know he has a scar on his left thigh if we we didn\u2019t have intimacy? Lol. If he\u2019s denying, he should open up his thigh let\u2019s see. His nails too says it all.\n\n\u201cIf these screenshots were fake, how did I get his pics that aren\u2019t public pics at the first place and how come I\u2019m the first to release this kind of pics of him? He has changed his hairstyle twice since I came out to speak up with receipts. He has done a lot to appear different,\u201d she alleged.",

Remember that it is about food and nutritional security, the well-being of our farmers, improved income and less use of chemical sprays for environmental sustainability,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the safety of the improved PBR Cowpea, the director-general, National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, assured Nigerians the crop is safe for both human consumption and the environment.\n\nHe stressed that the PBR, genetically-modified with a non-harmful substance sourced from the soil (Bacillus Thuringiensis) that resists insect attacks and infestation of the staple food, was subjected to several rigorous risks analysis and safety tests by the Federal Government before approval for public consumption.\n\nAlso, the country coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology OFAB, Nigeria chapter, Dr. Rose Gidado, said Nigeria has etched her place in the comity of nations with the commercialisation of the PBR Cowpea. Nigeria\u2019s action, she said, has caused other African nations to come learn from her success. She stressed there is no difference between the conventional cowpea and the modified one. \u201cApart from being resistant to insects, they share the same characteristics in taste, colour, texture etc.\u201d",

The general public is therefore advised to disregard it.\u201d\n\nA coalition of northern groups purchased the APC presidential nomination form and the expression of interest form at the International Conference Centre in Abuja, informing journalists that it was for Dr Jonathan.\n\nSporting fez caps with the inscription \u2018run Jonathan run\u2019, members of the coalition said the former president is the most qualified person to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn rejecting the forms, Dr Jonathan kept his plans close to his chest.\n\nThe purchase of the forms was the latest move in efforts by people who identify as his supporters to get him to contest.\n\nIn April, a crowd of supporters had held a rally, calling on him to join the race.\n\nAddressing them he said, \u201cYes, you are calling me to come and declare for the 2023 presidency, yes I can\u2019t tell I am declaring; the political process is ongoing, just watch out,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIf elected as President again, Jonathan can only serve for one term of four years, according to the constitution.\n\nHe was first elected in 2011 after completing the tenure of Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nPresident Buhari defeated Jonathan in the 2015 presidential elections.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nNo fewer than 51,000 repentant terrorists and their families have surrendered to troops serving in various theatres of operation in the North East, the military has said.\n\nThe Commander of Operation Hadin Kai, Major General Chris Musa, disclosed this to Channels Television during the latest edition of News Night which aired on Monday.\n\nHe explained that residents in the region have been helpful to the military, especially in the area of intelligence gathering despite the communication barrier in some localities.\n\nREAD ALSO: UN Chief Visits Borno IDPs, Says Reintegrating Repentant Terrorists Critical For Peace\n\n\u201cWe get information as quickly as things are happening,\u201d the commander said. \u201cSometimes, the challenge might probably be the way to communicate because we do not have network everywhere; but as soon as they get to where they can send messages across to us, they let us know.\n\n\u201cThat has assisted us greatly in subduing the insurgents to such an extent that we have so much peace. We have over 51,000 insurgents and their family members that have surrendered to us.\u201d\n\nNothing To Fear\n\nWhile many individuals and groups perceive the laying down of weapons by insurgents as a sign that the security forces are winning the war, others remain skeptical about the intention of such persons.\n\nGeneral Musa, on his part, believes Nigerians, especially residents in the North East have nothing to fear as the military will continue to ensure they are well protected from criminally-minded persons.\n\nAccording to him, the Nigerian Armed Forces has managed situations as such in the past in other countries, and replicating the same approach will be no different this time.\n\nThe Operation Hadin Kai chief in his words, \u201cNormally there will be some concerns and I don\u2019t blame the public for that, but I just want to assure them that we are professionals and we have done this before \u2026 in other countries where we had issues of disarmament.\n\n\u201cWhat goes on here now is that as soon as any of them is willing to surrender, he reports straight to the closest military location. The commander on the ground has his troops ready to disarm them, take over their arms, search them and profile them.\n\n\u201cThen the state government provides buses to move them to the camps already provided. The state government takes care of the management and administration, what we do is ensure that the perimeter is secure. So, we want to assure members of the communities that they are well secured and that they (repentant terrorists) will not pose any threat to anybody.\n\nWhy Surrender Now?\n\nMusa, who revealed that the population of repentant terrorists and their families in the military\u2019s custody was recorded in less than a year, gave an insight into what could have prompted the decision to surrender at this time.\n\nA lot of them, according to him, were tired of the fight and wanted to come out to lay their arms but could not do so because of the fear of being killed for disloyalty.\n\nHe added that the leadership tussle within the terrorists\u2019 camp following the death of their leader \u2013 Shekau, also created an avenue for willing insurgents to surrender to troops.\n\n\u201cI know everybody is asking why are they even surrendering now? For us, the surrendering started since July 2021 and for them to have been there (in the camps) to date shows you some level of commitment and why are they surrendering,\u201d the senior military officer explained.\n\n\u201cThe death of Shekau has opened a lot of opportunities because while he (Shekau) was there, he was very brutal; anybody who attempts to escape will be killed. They were scared of him (Shekau).\n\n\u201cBut they knew we would treat them professionally; by the laws of war, once your enemies surrender, you are duty-bound to receive him and treat him humanely until the process of the legal system takes its course, and that is what we are doing.\u201d\n\nGeneral Musa also faulted the claims that the military was pampering the repentant persons who played various roles in the over-decade-long insurgency that claimed thousands of lives.\n\nRather, he said, \u201cWe are not pampering them; we are just being in line with the statutory laws on the ground and that is why we ensure that all those ones that have been profiled are brought in and kept secure. Out of the over 51,000, 11,000 are males but not all of them are combatants.\n\n\u201cAmong the males, we have some that were enslaved, those that were born there, and those that were conscripted. Gradually, those are going to be sorted out, and then the legal system will take its course.\u201d",

          "text": "The trial of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) driver, Andrew Nice Ominnikoron, has begun at a Lagos High Court sitting at Tafawa Balewa Square, with the testimony of the first prosecution witness, Nneka Maryjane Odezulu.\n\nOminnikoron was arraigned on March 22 before Justice Serifat Sonaike on four-count charge bordering on rape, conspiracy and murder of his passenger, Bamise Ayanwola.\n\nAt the proceedings on Monday, the Lagos State, Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, who led the prosecution, informed the court that his office had amended the charge against the defendant and added additional proof of evidence against the defendant.\n\nREAD ALSO: Usifo Ataga: Policeman Testifies As 9th Witness, Tells Court How Chidinma Was Tracked\n\nPursuant to Section 155 and 251 (3) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State, he urged the court to let the defendant retake his plea.\n\nThe five-count amended charge was then read to the defendant and he pleaded not guilty to all the counts.\n\nThe prosecution swiftly called its first witness, Odezulu who proceeded to narrate to the court how the defendant raped her after tearing her clothes.\n\nWhile answering questions from the AG, the witness told Justice Sherifat Sonaike that before the defendant raped her, he slapped her and held her neck such that she couldn\u2019t breath again, she also said he tried to strangle her after which he tore her clothes.\n\nOdezulu, aged 29, described herself as a sales representative and a mother.\n\nShe said that on November, 25, 2021, after closing from work, around 8pm, which is the time she normally closes, she stood at Alesh Hotel Bus Stop, Ajah, where she saw the BRT bus parked.\n\nShe said that she approached the driver (the defendant) and asked him if he was going to get to her bus stop in the Jakande area of Lekki. After he answered yes, she asked how much the fare was and he said N100, so she boarded the bus and sat at the back.\n\nThe witness stated that shortly after, a man approached the defendant and asked him if he was going to Oshodi and he said yes then they started arguing about the price but later the man didn\u2019t enter the bus.\n\nOdezulu said, \u201cWhen I entered the BRT, the lights were on, but on getting to Lekki Conservation, Lekki-Ajah express way, he stopped the motor and brought out one medicine. He took the medicine with one bottle water, so I did not bother myself because I thought it was a medication.\n\n\u201cAfter that, he asked me to come to the front seat that why am I sitting at the back seat. Then I stood up and went to sit at the front. Then he started asking me questions what is my name, how old I am, who do I live with. In the process of asking me questions, he brought out his phone, and discussed with the person on the other end, about two transactions.\n\n\u201cWhen he concluded, he turned to me and said let\u2019s go and park somewhere and discuss. I said sir, I am coming back from work and I am tired and I need to go and pick my daughter from after school care, that was when I noticed that his manhood was up,\u201d the witness testified.\n\n\u201cThen I brought out my big phone, I wanted to call somebody and record what was happening, he was like what I\u2019m I doing, who do I want to call with my phone? He got up from the driver\u2019s seat and collected my phone from me.\n\n\u201cHe held on to a small knife and dragged me to the back and said I should pull off my clothes, I was like why will I pull off my clothes, do I know you before?\n\n\u201cWe started dragging and he said I should remove everything because I was not a baby. He slapped me and held my neck and wanted to strangle me. I couldn\u2019t breathe again, then his face changed and he said that if he kills me now, nothing will happen and nobody will know where I am that I should respect myself.\n\n\u201cHe pushed me down at the back seat, I held the seats and was begging him. He held the knife, tore my clothes and raped me from the back.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I told him to stop me that I want to come down. He said I told him that I was going to Jakande that he will drop me at my bus stop. On getting to my bus stop, I asked him to please give me my phone and open the door for me, and then he started apologising that he was sorry for everything that happened.\n\n\u201cHe said I should give him my account number. I told him, I don\u2019t need his money, and then he said that I am being stubborn that I don\u2019t want to give him my account number. So I gave him my account number and he sent N3000 and said I should use it to buy pain killers.\u201d\n\nThe witness further said, \u201cHe asked me to give him my phone number, I gave him before he gave me back my phone and then opened the BRT door. Then I used my big phone to record the plate number from the back.\n\n\u201cFew hours later, he called me and said he was sorry, and asked me if I had gotten home, have I picked my daughter from after school. I did not answer any of his questions then I ended the call. He called me back the next day and subsequently but I did not pick his calls.\u201d\n\nShe also said, \u201cAfter the incident, whenever I\u2019m coming back from work and see any BRT Bus, I use to look inside to see if it was him. I have seen him like four times at that Chevron Tollgate when he passed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she reported the rape case at the police station, she said no that she has had a bad experience with the police, at Jakande and that if she had reported they would have insulted her.\n\nThe witness showed the court the stripped dress she wore on the day she was raped, by the defendant, after which the prosecution sought to tender it in evidence as an exhibit.\n\nThe defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr Abayomi Omotubora, raised objections to some of the question answered by the witness.\n\nHe also raised objections to the admissibility of the dress sought to be tendered as an exhibit on the grounds that it was not stated in the proof of evidence. Citing Section 221 (1) (3) 2011 and 36 (6), 1999, of the Evidence Act to buttress his argument, he urged the court not to admit the exhibit in evidence.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Serifat Sonaike, overruled the objections of the defence counsel and admitted the exhibit in evidence.\n\nShe subsequently adjourned the case till Tuesday, May 10 for continuation of trial.\n\nAndrew Nice Ominnikoron is facing a five-count charge bordering on rape, conspiracy, felony, sexual assault, and murder preferred against him by the Lagos state government.\n\nThe prosecution said that the defendant on November 25, 2021, allegedly raped a 29 year -old lady Nneka Maryjane Odezulu, without her consent.\n\nIt said that the incident took place at about 7pm, at the Lekki- Ajah Conservation centre off the Lekki Ajah expressway in Lagos.\n\nThe DPP also told the court that Andrew Nice conspired with others now at large and forcefully had sexual intercourse with his 22-year-old passenger, Oluwabamise Ayanwole, a fashion designer without her consent after which he murdered her.\n\nDr Martins said the rape incident happened on February 25, 2022, at about 8 pm, on the Lekki-Ajah Conservation expressway.\n\nHe said that the defendant and others still at large on February 26, 2022, unlawfully killed Oluwabamise Ayanwole by throwing her out of a moving bus at Cater bridge after having sexual intercourse with her without her consent.\n\nAccording to the prosecutor, the offences committed is contrary to and punishable under Sections 411, 223, 260 and 165 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.\n\nWhen all the counts were read to the defendant, he pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.",

Abdulahi Adamu-led NWC and the Progressive Governors Forum.\n\nMEETING EXCERPTS\n\nAPC National Chairman, Sen. Abdulahi Adamu:\n\n\u201cThey have agreed to work together for the success of our great party. We have informed the President of the progress that we are making and I am grateful to the Almighty God that we have been able to reach an accord between the former governor, current governor and their esteemed followers. We have every reason to thank God and believe that the 2023 General Election in Zamfara State is a given for the APC.\n\n\u201cMy advice is that we should be careful not to go back to where we are coming from. We must learn to respect one another, respect the views of our party followers who are our greatest assets. To the former and current governor, you have a duty to sustain the spirit of understanding, togetherness and teamwork. On behalf of my colleagues, I commend this very useful agreement that we have reached.\u201d\n\nZamfara Governor, Bello Muhammad Matawale:\n\n\u201cChairman, you have played a fatherly role to all of us.

So many things have happened and which we have decided to put behind us. We dont have any other State aside Zamfara. We have a lot of work to do and by Gods Grace, seeing our intention, He will make it easy for us. We have to do the right thing for the good of our people and our state. We have come to an understanding to meet our people and tell them that the state is bigger than any of us, therefore any interest must see the state as number one.\u201d\n\nGovernor, Kebbi State and Chairman, Progressive Governors Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu:\n\n\u201cI am glad that both of them, very strong believers have demonstrated faith by knowing that Satan has done his bit but their faith remained unshaken and today we are witnessing this reconciliation. And I pray that God continue to elevate both of them. We are very glad that two people who should be working together are indeed working together and I am sure our party will be better for it, Zamfara State will be better for it and our Country will be better for it.\u201d",

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday adjourned till May 12, the decision to grant a restraining order requested by the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, against the Independent National Electoral Commission and the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on his presidential bid.\n\nEmefiele had through his counsel, Mike Ozekhome SAN applied for an order of status quo ante bellum to be made against INEC and AGF so that he would not be made to resign from office until 30 days to the general election.\n\nIn an ex-parte application argued on Monday, Emefiele denied being a political appointee but a public servant not caught by section 84 (12) of the new Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe CBN governor asked the court to invoke section 318 of the 1999 Constitution to bar the defendents from asking him to vacate office until 30 days to the February 2023 presidential election.\n\nEmefiele expressed apprehension that sale and submission of presidential nomination form would expire on Wednesday and that unless the INEC and AGF are ordered to maintain status ante bellum as at May 5 when he filed the suit, he would be made to vacate office before his form would be accepted by the appropriate authority.\n\nHowever in a brief ruling, Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed refused to grant the order but instead, ordered Emefiele to put the defendants on notice and also serve court processes on the defendants.\n\nJustice Mohammed ordered the defendants to appear before him on May 12 and show cause why the request should not be granted.",
