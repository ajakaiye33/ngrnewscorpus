          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday, asked the Economic Community of West African States parliament to address the prevalence of terrorism and irregular migration affecting member states.\n\nLawan also lamented the spate of insecurity and cross-border crimes such as banditry and kidnapping.\n\nHe described the criminal activities as severe threats to the stability and economic progress of most countries within the West African sub-region.\n\nThe Senate President said this, according to a statement by his media office, at the 2021 First Ordinary Session of the Economic Community of West African States Parliament.\n\nHe identified insurgency, drug trafficking, and ceaseless ethno-religious struggles as problems that continue to interfere with the freedom of citizens to move between member nations as guaranteed under the ECOWAS protocol on Free Movement of Persons and Goods.\n\nHe, therefore, called on ECOWAS Parliamentarians to seek out interventions aimed at tackling the lingering problems which are predominant features among member states.\n\nLawan added that doing so would ensure regional economic growth, besides tackling unemployment and stimulating economic multipliers within the sub-region.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhile the ECOWAS protocol on Free Movement of Persons and Goods remains a prized policy, for instance, insecurity, instability, and conflicts are matters requiring continuous attention.\n\n\u201cThe freedom to move between member nations is helpful to sub-regional economic growth, besides increasing the attendant benefits like job creation, reduction in underemployment, stimulation of economic multipliers, and better wellbeing.\n\n\u201cThis can hardly happen in an atmosphere of strife, cross-border crimes like banditry, insurgency, drug trafficking, and ceaseless ethno-religious struggles, amidst others.\n\n\u201cAs parliamentarians, we must examine the dimensions associated with these occurrences towards appropriate interventions.\n\n\u201cAn accord of purpose between member nations creates the needed synergy for the actualization of uniform visions.\n\n\u201cThe fostering of this uniformity partly rests with us and I am confident we can accomplish this, despite the limitations of institutional empowerment.\n\n\u201cIt is possible through consistent advocacy, and the broadening of understanding on our objectives.\u201d\n\nLawan said the First Ordinary Session for the year 2021 was projected to help lawmakers chart the way forward in the months ahead, particularly in engendering cohesion in eliminating terrorism, all forms of extremism, and the better implementation of trade agreements and protocols.\n\nHe also stressed the need to focus on irregular migration often leading to needless sorrows, pains, and deaths; the fight against diseases, drought, and the requirement to entrench transparency and accountability in our governance systems.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am additionally assured that we are well prepared to make our inputs from our individual appreciation of the issues, towards finding lasting solutions to the challenges.\u201d\n\nIn attendance at the forum were the Speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament, Rt. Hon. Sidie Mohamed Tunis; President of the Republic of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo; Vice President of the Republic of Liberia, Dr. Jewel Cianeh Taylor; and President of the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice, Honourable Justice Edward Amoako Asante.",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n.Says country on the verge of collapse\n\n.2023 polls threatened\n\n..Gives panacea for stopping secession agitations\n\n.As Olanipekun advocates true federalism, judicial reform\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nThe human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, has expressed fear and worry over the level of impunity in Nigeria, saying peace will continue to elude the country without a proper people\u2019s oriented constitution.\n\nAlso, former President of the Nigeria Bar Association, Wole Olanipekun, SAN, has advocated true federalism, immediate reform in judicial system, among others.\n\nThe duo made the remarks on Thursday, at the final sitting of the Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution, South West, Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Zonal Public Hearing, Lagos Center, held in Ikeja, under the chairmanship of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, representing Lagos Central.\n\nHowever, participants at the hearing reiterated calls for a total review of the constitution to reflect fiscal federalism; implementation of the Child Rights Act and Disability Act in states, local government autonomy, judicial autonomy, and police reform.\n\nWhile making a presentation, Falana made a large case for the poor and vulnerable, insisting that it was important to give secession agitators in the country the confidence of peace and sense of inclusion if they must remain as indivisible entity.\n\nCondemning the rate of impunity in the country, Falana stressed, \u201cOur country is ruled by rule of the rulers and not rule of law. People commit all manner of crime and get away with it because there are no sanctions. This must change. The Social Security Bill must also work so that jobless people can get stipends pending when they will get full employment.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat can we do very quickly to save this country which is on the verge of collapse.? If you don\u2019t want people to break away from Nigeria, we must give them confidence and sense of belonging, don\u2019t declare a war.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for the constitutional amendment to be fruitful, for us to have genuine outputs from this meeting, peace must reign. We must address Nigeria\u2019s problem frontally. We must also give people the confidence of peace and inclusion if we must kill the cries for secession. Don\u2019t declare a war.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in some parts of the country, the 2023 elections are already in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cINEC offices are being burnt, police stations are being burnt. In that kind of atmosphere, we cannot pretend that there is political stability in our country.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I am making a case for the poor, the masses of our people who are generally not represented in fora of this nature which are most times for the elites and privileged among our people.\n\n\u201cChapter two of the constitution guarantees the right to education, health, living minimum wage, good adequate housing, unemployment benefits, among others, but members of the ruling class conspired and agreed, regardless of political affiliation, that these provisions shall not be enforceable or made justiciable. But unless we are prepared to make these provisions justiciable and enforceable, this country will know no peace.\n\n\u201cWhatever constitution will come forth after now must make justiciable the fundamental objectives and directive principles of state without which there will be no political stability in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer also advocated that the Child Rights Act enacted in 2003, and the Disability Act, be domesticated and implemented in states if the constitution review must make meaning to the common man.\n\n\u201cWe are submitting that the Child Rights Act enacted in 2003 be made applicable throughout Nigeria, we have to work it out.\n\n\u201cAs of today, only 25 states have adopted the law, but even then, not fully implemented. Unfortunately, it is states where banditry, kidnapping and terrorism thrive that have refused to adopt or domesticate the law, and that is where banditry, terrorism, and kidnappers recruit daily.\n\n\u201cWe also advocate a 50/50 representation for men and women in government. We should emulate other African countries where women even take a larger percentage in government affairs.\n\n\u201cRight to employment: all citizens, without discrimination on any group whatsoever, [shall] have the opportunity for securing adequate means of livelihood as well as adequate opportunity to secure suitable employment (s.17(3)(a); Conditions of work: \u201cGender-sensitive rights \u2013 Right to equal pay: for equal work without discrimination on account of sex, or on any other ground whatsoever (S.17(3) (e); Right of the child: children, young persons and the aged are [entitled to be]protected against any exploitation whatsoever, and against moral and material neglect (S. 17(3)f); Right to public assistance in conditions of need (S. 17(3)(g),\u201d he stated.\n\nFalana also advocated police reform, proposing a change of name from the Nigeria Police Force, NPF to the Nigerian Police Service, NPS to reflect reality of modern-day policing. He also advocated for the upward review of police salary.\n\nOlanipekun, represented by his son, Oladapo, advocated that judicial outcomes be respected and adhered to so that the common man can feel protected and their rights protected.\n\nAccording to him, the Electoral Act should be amended to allow governorship election cases to terminate at the Supreme Court. This, he said, is important to stem the tide of conflicting judgments arising from Appeal Courts.\n\nOlanipekun also advocated that more judges be appointed into the Supreme Court to reduce the workload of judges.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

We find nanotechnology to have applications in virtually all other technologies, including space, artificial intelligence, and robotics as it concerns improved productivity and reduction in size and cost.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said that the Federal Government was determined to improve funding of Science, Technology, and Innovation to actualize its set objectives.\n\n\u201cMr. President announced that 0.5% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), will now be used to fund STI in the country, though the African Union (AU), recommended 1% of GDP to be utilized for Science and Technology in all countries of the continent, the 0.5% is an improvement over what we had in the past.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said that efforts are on the ground, to ensure that Nigeria is prepared for a post crude oil era, adding that Nigeria has 187 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and has the highest natural gas reserves in the world and 9th highest in the world.\n\nDr. Onu said that the Ministry of Science and Technology is introducing Methanol to the nation\u2019s economy, as it can be used to produce as many as 1000 different products that can be used in our homes, schools, offices, hospitals, farms, and factories.\n\nHe said; \u201cThe production of methanol will help us to stop gas flaring in the country. Since natural gas is the major feedstock for its production, this will increase the demand for natural gas and hence initially reduce and finally help stop gas flaring in the country\u201d.\n\nThe Minister added that Methanol fuel technology will be fully domesticated in the country, noting that Nigerian professionals can fully grasp the technology and be in a position to export the technology to other countries in the near future.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Science and Technology, Barr. Mohammed Abdullahi called for close collaboration among the Federal, States, and the Ministry\u2019s agencies to enhance the effective domestication of the National STI roadmap 2017-2030.\n\nHe further said that state governments should create the needed governance structure that will facilitate the deployment of STI in fast-tracking economic development in the states.\n\nBarr. Abdullahi advocated that the forum should initiate a mechanism for joint R &D programs between the Ministry and states that have a comparative advantage in certain fields of research.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Willie Obiano placed high premium on health, security and welfare of the people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe keynote address was delivered by Dr Nosa Orhue, a Consultant Public Health Physician, who spoke on the theme \u201cCareer Pathway for Doctors: Addressing the Needless Controversies and Way Forward\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe OGM was declared open by Obiano, who was represented by Dr Vincent Okpala, the Commissioner of Health in the state.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met on Thursday with security formations in the country, urging them to put an end continued attacks on its facilities nationwide.\n\nThe Commission warned that the attacks will disrupt the electoral process, undermine Nigerian democracy and destabilise the country.\n\nINEC Chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu issued the warning in Abuja during the emergency meeting with the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES).\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nWhile lamenting that the last few weeks have been very challenging for the Commission, he noted that the spate of arson and vandalism targeting the Commission\u2019s facilities and property has become a major threat to its scheduled activities and the entire electoral process.\n\nHe said that a preliminary assessment so far indicates that the Commossion has lost 1,105 ballot boxes, 694 voting cubicles, 429 electric generating sets and 13 utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux).\n\nYakubu, however, expressed confidence that by working together with the security agencies, the attacks and wanton destruction of critical electoral assets could be stopped.\n\n\u2018No doubt, the last few weeks have been very challenging to the Commission. The spate of arson and vandalisation targeting the Commission\u2019s facilities and property has become a major threat to our scheduled activities and the entire electoral process. In the last two years, the Commission has recorded a total of 41 incidents involving deliberate attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities,\u2019 the INEC Chairman stated.\n\n\u2018Nine of these incidents happened in 2019 and 21 cases in 2020. In the last four weeks, 11 offices of the Commission were either set ablaze or vandalised. Two of these incidents were caused by Boko Haram and Bandit attacks while 10 resulted from thuggery during election and post-election violence.\n\n\u2018However, the majority of the attacks (29 out of 41) were unrelated to election or electoral activities. In fact, 18 of them occurred during the EndSARS protests in October last year while 11 attacks were organised by \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d and \u201choodlums\u201d.\n\n\u2018Although the Commission is assessing loss of materials during recent attacks, our preliminary assessment so far indicate that we lost 1,105 ballot boxes, 694 voting cubicles, 429 electric generating sets and 13 utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux). By working together with the security agencies, we can stop these attacks and the wanton destruction of critical electoral assets.\n\n\u2018These attacks, which initially appeared as isolated and occasional actions, have now become more frequent and systematic targeted at demobilising and dismantling critical electoral infrastructure in the country.\n\n\u2018This will not only undermine the Commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and other electoral activities but will also damage the nation\u2019s electoral process and democracy. Indeed, these attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities should now be treated as a national security emergency.\n\n\u2018Under the auspices of ICCES, we should ramp up our activities to curtail these unjustifiable acts of aggression. This will entail not only drawing on our separate and collective resources within ICCES, but also increased collaboration with citizens, communities and all stakeholders. I must place on record the support to the Commission from communities we serve across the country.\n\n\u2018Among many other things, they have donated land to locate many of the Commission\u2019s facilities, provided voluntary assistance during electoral activities like registration of voters and even donated materials such as chairs and shelter during elections.\n\n\u2018Even in the context of recent destruction of INEC facilities, some of these communities have offered to rebuild our offices and to help protect them going forward. We should tap into this goodwill in finding solutions to the present situation,\u2019 Yakubu noted.\n\nSpeaking further, the Chairman said: \u2018As a Commission, we have been undertaking our own internal review of the situation and seeking answers. Only last week, the Commission met with (RECs) and received briefings about these rising threats.\n\n\u2018We are presently compiling the useful suggestions from the meeting and other internal review, which we hope to share with this body in due course.\n\n\u2018I understand that the security agencies are doing their own individual assessments. Beyond Election Day security, we look forward to creating a framework for an all-year round, end-to-end protection of electoral facilities under the auspices of ICCES. To disrupt the electoral process is to undermine our democracy and destabilise the country.\u2019\n\nIn his reaction, the National Security Adviser and Co-Chairman of ICCES, Babagana Mungono, charged key intelligence agencies to unravel those behind the attacks.",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure; Noah Ebije, Kaduna; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Lukman Olabiyi; Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto; Sola Ojo, Kaduna; Stanley Uzoaru, George Onyejiuwa Owerri and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution (As Amended) began public hearing yesterday, in the various geo-political zones across the country, with renewed clamour for creation of additional state in the South East, state police and power devolution among other demands listed by the State governors and other stakeholders.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai and his Delta and Plateau counterparts, Ifeanyi Okowa and Simon Lalong, respectively, top the list of governors calling for power devolution and true federalism\n\nEl Rufai argued that devolution of powers is necessary because the current structure overburdens the federal government with too many responsibilities which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nThe governor further recalled that the APC Committee on True Federalism, which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly can more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\n\u201cThe power to hire and fire police officers should revert fully and totally to the Inspector General of Police, under the supervision of the National Police Council, as envisaged by the Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Asaba, Delta state capital, which hosted the public hearing Delta, Bayels and Edo states, Over Ifeanyi Okowa said there should be \u201cacceptable and legitimate division of powers among different tiers of government; a written constitution delineating such division; the coordinate supremacy of the levels of government with regard to their respective functions; and a considerable measure of autonomy \u2013 fiscal, legislative and judicial \u2013 of the Federal Government and the federating units.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was represented by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, advocated that revenues collected by the Federal Government through the parastatals of NNPC, NLNG, CBN, NIMASA, FAAN and other similar agencies should be remitted into the federation account.\n\n\u2022We want amendments that\u2019ll enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity, prosperity \u2013 Ugwuanyi\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi declared his administration\u2019s support for constitution amendments that will enhance the nation\u2019s unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail\u201d.\n\nThe governor enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and entire Enugu state citizenry to avail themselves the opportunity of the zonal public hearing to participate in the national conversation.\n\n\u201cI, particularly, acknowledge the leader of the team and Senator representing Enugu West Senatorial District in the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Distinguished Senator Prof. Ike Ekweremadu, CFR. I also recognise in a special way, Distinguished Senator, Chuka Utazi, who represents me and the people of Enugu North Senatorial District in the Red Chamber of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues from Enugu, Anambra and Ebonyi states, the Speaker of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi, assured the people of South East geo-political zone that the state legislature will first seek their opinions before adopting the outcome of the constitutional review by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Speaker, who maintained that constitution alteration is a continuous exercise, commended the 9th National Assembly for taking up the task again and thanked governor Ugwuanyi for providing the enabling atmosphere for the event.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, Senator Ekweremadu, also applauded governor Ugwuanyi, who he described as \u201cInsurance Guru\u201d, for his immense contributions towards the hosting of the zonal public hearing in Enugu.\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu pushes for special status for Lagos\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who declared the Lagos centre of the public hearing open, yesterday, demanded a special economic status for the state, saying the progress and prosperity of Nigeria is inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State.\n\nSanwo-Olu also demanded for a State Police and entrenchment of true fiscal federalism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of State Police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly, for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a Special Economic Status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited land mass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this Special Status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me, at this point, to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Constitution reference point of democracy \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nSokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, represented by his Deputy, Alhaji Muhammadu Manir Dan Iya, described the Constitution as the reference point of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in the 22 years of Nigeria\u2019s experience in government by representation, our gains have more than justified our challenges.\n\n\u201cAll constitutions are, therefore, work in progress, because they are subject to the changing needs and aspirations the people, at different times.\n\n\u201cAnd constitutional reviews are the processes for ensuring this guiding document plays that function.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu noted that, the exercise is coming at the time of Nigeria\u2019s life when more dialogue is in dire need.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportune time to, therefore, collectively brainstorm on how to discuss these issues, for the country to move forward in unison, by having a more robust constitution.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 Constitution outdated- Senator Uba Sani\n\nThe Senator representing Kaduna Central Zone, Uba Sani noted that the 1999 was outdated with some contentious issues that needed to be addressed, hence, the need to review it.\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna Sani noted that the Constitution was last reviewed 22 years ago which had brought crisis into governance.\n\n\u2022UN Women coalition advocates more in governance, inclusive language\n\nThe Coalition of Women Leaders in Kaduna State, in collaboration with UN Women advocated for an increase of women\u2019s rights, especially in political leadership, to enhance the participation of women in governance.\n\nThe coalition also called on the representatives of the committee currently meeting in Kaduna to be conscious of inclusive language as they amend the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u2022State police, additional states dominate S\u2019East constitution review\n\nThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution which kicked off in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday, was dominated by popular agitations for State policing and creation of another State in South East.\n\nChief of Staff to Abia State government, ACB Agbazuari, while submitting his memorandum, noted that State police will strengthen the peaceful coexistence in the southeast and check security challenges.\n\nHe urged members of the senate committee review to look into their submission in view of granting their request.\n\nSimilarly, Chief Theo Okire, who represented Aba Mass Movement, submitted that an additional states should be created in the South East.\n\nHe said if additional states are created in the South East, it would bring an even political atmosphere and less marginalisation of the zone.\n\nOther memoranda submitted were calls on gender equity, revenue allocation system, youth empowerment in politics, maintaining standards in professions in the country and accordance of constitutional roles to traditional institutions.\n\nGover Hope Uzodimma who also seized the opportunity to warn his detractors said: \u201cLet me, however, use this auspicious opportunity to tell these alarmists and pretenders to love of Ndigbo, that they are not more Igbo than I am and they do not love Igbo more than I do.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that while they want immediate and sentimental public applause, I want enduring prescriptions that can comprehensively address the Igbo challenge in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding simplistic, what we seek is justice and equity. When we talk of restructuring or devolution of power, we are talking actually of having an environment created for us to unleash our potential and talent without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cWe are also talking of being treated equally like every other part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 constitution amendment effort in futility, Babalola tells NASS\n\nLegal luminary Aare Afe Babalola (SAN) has charged the 9th National Assembly to, rather than waste time and resources at amending the 1999 constitution, convoke a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution.\n\nHe said the way out is to return the country to a parliamentary system of government and the 1963 structure.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 constitution to cure the inherent defects in the 1999 constitution. First, you cannot cure fraud. Second, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President. Or can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution? The fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become and Iroko tree which has branches. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound around the Presidential system of government. Why then is the National Assembly afraid of calling a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution and come up with a Parliamentary system of government as we had in 1963,\u201d he further said.\n\n\u2022N/Assembly\u2019ll provide a constitution that\u2019ll Nigeria challenges \u2013 Omo-Agege\n\nDeputy Senate President and Chairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege has expressed the determination of the National Assembly to provide Nigerians with a fair and inclusive constitution that will address the challenges of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this committee is how to manage the review exercise in a fair, inclusive, credible and transparent manner. At the commencement of this 9th Senate, we had set for ourselves a legislative agenda as a basis on which we are to be assessed. Sitting prominently in that agenda is the need to address , by way of constitutional amendments, topical issues like judicial and Electoral Reforms, Local Government Autonomy, and devolution of powers.\u201d",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO) has charged the Federal Government to immediately take steps towards addressing the socio-economic, political and security challenges threatening the existence and unity of the country.\n\nThe body comprising Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), and Nigeria Union Of Journalists (NUJ) also condemned the high cost of governance, outrageous allowances and flamboyant lifestyles of political officers and appealed to politicians and state actors to minimise their inflammatory rhetorics to reduce tension and ease the growing sense of fear among Nigerians\n\nIt also called for the pruning of the excessive powers vested in the Federal Government. It said the country\u2019s resources hold innumerable economic and soft power advantages for the well being of the entire population if well managed.\n\nThese positions are contained in a communique jointly signed today by Kabiru A. Yusuf, President NPAN and President NPO; Mustapha Isa, President of NGE and Chris Isiguzo, President of NUJ after the end of its recent meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe NPO tasked the Federal Government to immediately implement the report of the Kaduna Governor, Mallam Nasir el\u2019Rufai-led committee report on true federalism and restructuring even as it also called for the implementation of the Steve Orosanye report on restructuring and rationalisation of Federal Government parastatals, commissions and agencies, which provides a veritable road map for arresting the unsustainable high cost of governance.\n\nThe El\u2019Rufai committee inaugurated in August 2017 by the Progressive Governors Forum, the umbrella body of governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket, submitted its report in January 2018,recommending the merger of states to boost their solvency, review of derivation, devolution of power, state police and other far-reaching adjustments to the structure of governance.\n\nSaid the NPO: \u201cA Federal system of government, particularly in a country like Nigeria which is an overbearing centre is counterproductive to the development of the centre itself and the component units. To leave the Federal Government with 68 items under the Exclusive Legislative List, including policing, is a recipe for unending destructive tension in the struggle for advantage among the federating units. It explains why our country is seemingly overwhelmed by non-state actors engaged in criminality and separatist agitations.\u201d\n\nIt cautioned the Federal Government on the frequency at which it solicits foreign loan as it may spell doom in the future considering the dwindling relevance of crude oil, the country\u2019s major revenue earner in the world market.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to avoid the debt overhang inherent in excessive borrowing. We are aware that borrowing is good so long as such loans are deployed to funding enduring development projects, within the GDP ratio. However, the current borrowing in the face of the slide in the value of the country\u2019s number one revenue earner-oil remains worrisome,\u201d NPO said.\n\nIt called for the immediate passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill, (PIB) and asked the government to put pressure on the National Assembly to hasten action on the bill.\n\n\u201cThe Bill has gone into our history as the longest bill to ever go through legislative processes. It is of common knowledge that the petroleum industry has been long overdue for an overhaul and the passage of the bill will be a major boost. That the bill has stayed this long in the National Assembly militates against improved corporate governance in the oil sector.\u201d\n\nThe group lamented that Nigeria has been embroiled lately in profound socio-economic, political and security challenges that threaten its very existence as reflected in ethnic divisions and separatist agitations in the country, with growing fears that an implosion is imminent.\n\n\u201cToday, criminality \u2013 kidnapping for ransom, banditry, arson, killings \u2013 defines the everyday reality for a good number of our citizens.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022DPR targets to remit N900bn to FAAC in Q2\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has expressed interest in purchasing a 20 per cent minority equity stake in Dangote Refinery, Lagos, reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refining facility and the world\u2019s largest single-train plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce up to 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and 4 million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nNNPC Chief Operating Officer, Refining and Petrochemicals, Mr. Mustapha Yakubu, unfolded the investment plans yesterday at the end of a two-day Nigeria Oil and Gas Opportunity Fair (NOGOF), 2021, tagged: \u201cLeveraging Opportunities and Synergies for Post Pandemic Recovery of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\u201d\n\nHe spoke just as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nYakubu said discussions were already ongoing with the Dangote Group for the acquisition of the stake.\n\nHe stated during the virtual event that the collaboration will further ensure undisrupted product supply to Nigerians when the deal materialises.\n\nHe added that one of its divisions, the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) was handling the negotiations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have what we call the green field refinery and the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) of the NNPC. What we do, our strategy is to collaborate and seek strategic partnerships with private investors.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have Dangote Refinery, which is the 650,000 capacity barrels per day plus a mini 80,000 tonnes per annum petrochemical plant.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing there? I can tell you today that we are seeking to have a 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote Refinery as part of our collaboration and you know that there\u2019s a huge quantity of crude for that refinery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 650,000 barrels, going into a single crude distillation unit (CDU).\n\nWhen that comes on board, it will also wet the nation for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the corporation is also interested in partnering with the African Refinery in Port Harcourt, a co-location facility, the CNCEC Chinese group, which is interested in building two refineries in Nigeria, the Waltersmith modular plant, in addition to collaborating with Azikel refineries on condensate production.\n\nYakubu stated that notwithstanding the global push for renewables, Nigeria has a local, domestic and regional market for hydrocarbons.\n\nHe added that Africa will continue to rely on fossil fuels at least in the next 20 years.\n\nHe said the country would not just fold its arms and do nothing with its hydrocarbons just because the International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted a net-zero emissions scenario by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday, when you are bringing products into Nigeria, they disappear to neighbouring countries. There\u2019s nowhere in countries around Nigeria that they sell fuel for less than N400 per litre. So, there\u2019s a market,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the country\u2019s non-functional refineries, he said there was a deliberate effort to power the refineries down because of the need to do a full rehabilitation beyond the regular turnaround maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe believe the only way to do that is to power them down to reduce some of the cost. We have heard that we are spending so much money on the refineries, yet they are idle.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are costs associated with idle refineries; we have staff salaries and remuneration and then the power plant utility operations. And also we need to maintain the plants in terms of preservation and lost investments because they are assets that we believe can be brought to life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the NNPC was exiting the running of the country\u2019s four refineries, and it has recently called for bids from competent and qualified contractors for that purpose.\n\nYakubu explained that NNPC was not in the best position to run the refineries and has opted for a new model, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) for the running of the facilities.\n\nHe added that it is important to bring in O&M professionals, especially given the fact that as an engineer in the NNPC, no matter how competent, the employee must exit when they hit 60 years of age.\n\nThe COO said Expression of Interest (EoI) for organisations that would run the refineries was already out and many people had been evaluated.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NNPC will choose the best contractors to handle the project.\n\nAccording to him, it is becoming more difficult to get local lenders to finance fossil fuel businesses because of the renewable energy drive, adding that the NNPC is also looking for investors for the rehabilitation of its pipelines because they remain the best way to transport products from refineries to depots.\n\nDPR Targets N900bn Remittance into Federation Account in Q2\n\nThe DPR has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe agency has also received over $20 billion investment proposals since the inauguration of the Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) in Lagos by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Director of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, at a strategic management session with the management of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) yesterday in Lagos, said the agency exceeded its first quarter revenue generation target by 6.99 per cent and that the actual amount it remitted was N452 billion.\n\nThe NEITI team was led by its Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, who said the team came to seek partnership with DPR on how to collectively ensure transparency and create value for Nigerians through the country\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nAuwalu added that the agency was working to double the first quarter remittance and is trying to support the government to deliver services to the people.\n\n\u201cJanuary to March, we exceeded our target by 6.99 per cent. Actual collection, first quarter, N452 billion already sent to government and between April, May and June, I think if we are lucky, we will double this.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be around N900 billion, which is the budgeted figure.

          "text": "A Civic Media Lab collation of media reported deaths in Nigeria for the first six months of 2020 ranks Kaduna State as the part of the country with the highest report of murders.\n\nIts record of 493 persons killed between January and June, is higher than the reported deaths in the Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorised territories of Borno; 290, Adamawa; 37 and Yobe; 5.\n\nThere were more persons kidnapped in Kaduna State \u2013 178 than any other part of the country based on the reports collected by CML.\n\nThis is in contrast to the 10 recorded incidents of kidnapping in Borno.\n\nIn keeping with the increasing trend of attacks organised by loosely defined marauders called bandits by the media, the motorcycle-riding killers and cattle rustlers were responsible for at least 566 of the 1,692 deaths shown in the Life Count data.\n\nThis is three times more than the 130 attributed to Boko Haram and its ISWAP fraction.\n\nThe Life Count data collated 185 incidents and 55 of these were pinned on bandits.\n\nThis again was more than the eight reports labelled as Boko Haram attacks and the three committed by ISWAP.\n\nBoko Haram was more deadly with their attacks, killing an average of 15 persons per foray.\n\nCombined with the nine deaths from three strikes by ISWAP, the rate drops to 11.8.\n\nThe bandits, on the other hand, had a murder rate of 10.3 deaths with every attack.\n\nWhile killings by herdsmen are not dominating the headlines, the Life Count data recorded about 29 raids, which led to 148 deaths.\n\nThe majority of the deaths carried out by herdsmen as collated by Life Count, were from Kaduna \u2013 63 not from Benue \u2013 26.\n\nOutside the Northern region, the cattle breeders were accused of killing 21 persons in Delta, the highest death toll from herdsmen attacks in the South.\n\nThe most fatal of the 185 incidents reported though, was the 250 deaths recorded when the police took on the well-fortified bandit headquarters in Birnin Gwari in Kaduna.\n\nAsides from the 250 deaths most of whom were reported to be on the side of the terrorists, CML\u2019s Life Count collated report showed that police officers were involved in 18 extra-judicial killings.\n\nThe army increased that number to 22, with four murders, while trying to enforce COVID-19 lockdowns in a community in Taraba State.\n\nThe police raid on the bandit HQ, painted February crimson.\n\nThat sole incident contributed to more than half of the deaths in the bloodiest month of the year so far.\n\nIn January\n\nIn the first month of the year, there were 181 deaths.\n\nAlthough this month had the lowest number of recorded deaths according to the CML Life Count data, it would be remembered for three attacks.\n\nOn January 6, Boko Haram detonated an improvised explosive device on a bridge in the border province of Gamboru in Borno State, killing 30 and injuring 35 others.\n\nEight days later, bandits attacked the convoy of the Emir of Potiskum in Yobe State, killing 30 and kidnapping a staggering 100 persons.\n\nA week later, the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Adamawa State, Lawal Andimi, was beheaded by the ISWAP faction of the Boko Haram militants.\n\nISWAP had ceremonially killed 11 Christians in December, saying they would launch a campaign against Christians in Nigeria, in 2020, as retribution for the killing of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, by the USA.\n\nIn February\n\nThere were 460 deaths in that month, the highest death-rate in the first six months of 2020.\n\nThe first major incident was on February 5, when the police raided bandits at Birnin Gwari.\n\nThe police were surprisingly engaged by a well-supplied band, who attacked the security force\u2019s air team with anti-aircraft guns.\n\nThe death toll of 250 was the most violent recorded this year so far.\n\nFive days later, Boko Haram made a signature raid, killing 30 defenceless passengers.\n\nThey were camped outside Maiduguri because they missed entering the city before the 5:00pm curfew.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, the marauding band terrorizing the North-West, showed a glimpse of what residents in certain parts of Katsina were to face, killing 33 in a raid on two villages.\n\nIn March\n\nLife Count recorded 180 deaths in March. The third bloodiest day of the year after February 5, was March 2.\n\nOn this day, over 50 people were killed in Igabi local government in Kaduna State.\n\nA witness to the attack said newborns and almajiris were not spared in the carnage.\n\nThe witness said the bandits, whom he kept describing as Boko Haram, stole nothing and even cremated some of the persons they had already murdered.\n\n20 days later, bandits expressed their fearlessness, killing 29 security officials made up of the army, the police and Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps in Niger State.\n\nThe area of Niger where the engagement happened is close to the Birnin Gwari Local Government where the bandits hold sway.\n\nIn April\n\nLife Count recorded 183 deaths in the fourth month of the year.\n\nThe bloodiest day was April 19.\n\nBandits invaded a village in Katsina State, killing 34 and carting away as much foodstuff as their 200 motorcycle cavalcade could carry.\n\nA source said the raiders came for the government palliatives given to the residents whose lives have been under the grip of the killers and rustlers.\n\nSix days before that, two communities in Taraba State continued their feud over some ancestral fishing ponds, 25 persons were killed in the latest episode of the communal clash.\n\nPrior to both attacks, bandits raided Sokoto, another North-Western state.\n\nThe attack which left 22 persons dead, is said to have lasted for three uninterrupted hours.\n\nIn May\n\nMay was the third bloodiest month of CML\u2019s Life Count collation.\n\nAbout 252 persons were killed in 35 reported incidents.\n\nThere were three incidents with deaths over 20 and above during this 31-day period.\n\nThe most brutal of them was the murder of 74 persons in Sokoto State.\n\nThe raid on Sabom Birni came just a day after the governor, Aminu Tambuwal, paid a visit in company with his security chiefs.\n\nThe other two major attacks were 20 each in Kaduna and Borno.\n\nIn June\n\nAfter February\u2019s 460 was June\u2019s 395.\n\nIn this month, a village in Borno State was completely raised to the ground by an armed group not labeled as Boko Haram.\n\nOn June 10, the group killed 81 persons, who were herding their cattle in an open field.\n\nThose, who tried to escape the shooting were run down with vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nThe village head was kidnapped, before the village itself was burnt down.\n\nFour days after that, Boko Haram/ISWAP killed 40 civilians and 20 soldiers in the same state.\n\nThe same day, Felo Village was burnt, 50 persons were killed in five villages in Katsina.\n\nThe attack was linked to bandits.\n\nThe National Assembly, which is dominated by representatives from the Northern region of the country, have asked the President to freshen up the offices occupied by his service chiefs.\n\nIt is a request the President has not deem fit to agree to.\n\nMany of the communities being attacked are agrarian in nature.\n\nFarmers in these places are finding it impossible to earn a living.\n\nObservers feel Nigeria\u2019s food import bill will continue to soar if it cannot till all the hectares of farmland available to it due to the incessant bloodshed across the country especially in the Northern region.",

The third bloodiest day of the year after February 5, was March 2.\n\nOn this day, over 50 people were killed in Igabi local government in Kaduna State.\n\nA witness to the attack said newborns and almajiris were not spared in the carnage.\n\nThe witness said the bandits, whom he kept describing as Boko Haram, stole nothing and even cremated some of the persons they had already murdered.\n\n20 days later, bandits expressed their fearlessness, killing 29 security officials made up of the army, the police and Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps in Niger State.\n\nThe area of Niger where the engagement happened is close to the Birnin Gwari Local Government where the bandits hold sway.\n\nIn April\n\nLife Count recorded 183 deaths in the fourth month of the year.\n\nThe bloodiest day was April 19.\n\nBandits invaded a village in Katsina State, killing 34 and carting away as much foodstuff as their 200 motorcycle cavalcade could carry.\n\nA source said the raiders came for the government palliatives given to the residents whose lives have been under the grip of the killers and rustlers.\n\nSix days before that, two communities in Taraba State continued their feud over some ancestral fishing ponds, 25 persons were killed in the latest episode of the communal clash.\n\nPrior to both attacks, bandits raided Sokoto, another North-Western state.\n\nThe attack which left 22 persons dead, is said to have lasted for three uninterrupted hours.\n\nIn May\n\nMay was the third bloodiest month of CML\u2019s Life Count collation.\n\nAbout 252 persons were killed in 35 reported incidents.\n\nThere were three incidents with deaths over 20 and above during this 31-day period.\n\nThe most brutal of them was the murder of 74 persons in Sokoto State.\n\nThe raid on Sabom Birni came just a day after the governor, Aminu Tambuwal, paid a visit in company with his security chiefs.\n\nThe other two major attacks were 20 each in Kaduna and Borno.\n\nIn June\n\nAfter February\u2019s 460 was June\u2019s 395.\n\nIn this month, a village in Borno State was completely raised to the ground by an armed group not labeled as Boko Haram.\n\nOn June 10, the group killed 81 persons, who were herding their cattle in an open field.\n\nThose, who tried to escape the shooting were run down with vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nThe village head was kidnapped, before the village itself was burnt down.\n\nFour days after that, Boko Haram/ISWAP killed 40 civilians and 20 soldiers in the same state.\n\nThe same day, Felo Village was burnt, 50 persons were killed in five villages in Katsina.\n\nThe attack was linked to bandits.\n\nThe National Assembly, which is dominated by representatives from the Northern region of the country, have asked the President to freshen up the offices occupied by his service chiefs.\n\nIt is a request the President has not deem fit to agree to.\n\nMany of the communities being attacked are agrarian in nature.\n\nFarmers in these places are finding it impossible to earn a living.\n\nObservers feel Nigeria\u2019s food import bill will continue to soar if it cannot till all the hectares of farmland available to it due to the incessant bloodshed across the country especially in the Northern region.",

          "text": "When Farouk Yahaya was moved from the Nigerian army 1 division in Kaduna state to oversee the wars against Boko Haram in the north-east, he pledged to ensure \u201ctotal peace and sanity\u201d in the troubled region. He may not have achieved that completely, but things improved under his watch going by available records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData obtained from the Council on Foreign Relations show that from April 1 when the major general took charge of the war against Boko Haram, till Thursday when he was named Nigeria\u2019s chief of army staff, the number of civilians killed by insurgents dropped by 17 percent, while the number of Boko Haram members killed shot up by 46 percent.\n\nThe data, gathered from media reports, show that 946 persons were killed by the insurgents from when he was appointed theatre commander of the recently renamed operation Hadin Kai till May 2021, compared to the 1,137 that died in the previous 14 months.\n\nOn the side of the Islamist extremist group, 2,122 members were reportedly killed during Yahaya\u2019s reign, compared to the 1,449 that were killed within the previous timeframe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotwithstanding, the insurgents launched a number of audacious attacks while Yahaya was in charge in the north-east, such as in late April when they forced thousands of residents in Geidam, Yobe state, to flee to Niger Republic during an attack that lasted for days.\n\nNIGERIAN ARMY\u2019S OLIVER TWIST\n\nIn his various roles in the Nigerian army, Yahaya has often demanded more from the personnel under his watch. His watchword was a continuous improvement with no room for slacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he took over from Mohammed Mohammed as the general officer commanding (GOC) 1 division in Kaduna, he told the soldiers and officers at the division that they must be guided by the rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cI expect nothing less but more,\u201d he had emphasised. \u201cI urge you all to remain steadfast. We should be apolitical and be committed to our areas of responsibility. You must conduct yourselves well and be professional in the discharge of your duties.\u201d\n\nOn February 5, when more than 50 Boko Haram insurgents were reportedly killed, Yahaya told the troops not to back down as \u2018the party\u2019 was just getting started.\n\n\u201cYou must not give room for laxity and assumptions. When you see the terrorists, deal decisively with them. Pursue them, don\u2019t spare their lives,\u201d he had told them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSPEAKS SPANISH, LOVES CRACKING JOKES\n\nThe incoming army chief, who is from Sokoto state, is aged 55 and is of the 37 regular course of the Nigerian army. According to his curriculum vitae, a copy of which was obtained by TheCable, he speaks and writes four languages including Arabic and Spanish.\n\nHe was commissioned as a regular combatant on September 22, 1990, and has since then attended nine military courses, including the national defence course in Chile. He has also been promoted on seven occasions \u2014 the last time was in September 2017 when he became a major general.\n\nYahaya has also held various key positions during his service which spans over three decades, including as deputy military secretary; principal general staff officer, ministry of defence; commander of the 4 brigade and 29 task force; military secretary, GOC, 1 division and commander, headquarters of the theatre command, operation Hadin Kai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has also been laurelled on at least 10 occasions, including the Economic Community of West Africa States Monitoring Group medal, field command medal, general operations medal, silver jubilee medal, and golden jubilee medal.\n\nOne interesting thing stands out in his CV though: He loves cracking jokes \u2014 and listening to local music.\n\nHUNTED SHEKAU WITH THE AID OF CNJTF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2020, the Nigerian army command in the north-east declared Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram leader who is now reported dead, wanted alongside 85 other members of the group.\n\nUnlike in the past when the army often hunts the Boko Haram leader all alone, Yahaya enlisted the CNJTF as partners in the fresh hunt, with clear guidelines for their operation and conduct.\n\nHe had said such a move would \u201charness the skills and competence of the personnel in terms of the terrain\u201d of the north-east, particularly the Sambisa forest area, the insurgents\u2019 key hideout.\n\n\u2018NOT WORRIED BY CHARMS\u2019\n\nDuring his stint as the commander of the 4 brigade in Edo state in May 2016, the army had arrested 10 members of the Niger Delta Avengers suspected to be responsible for attacks on oil and gas installations in the Niger Delta region.\n\nWhile they were being paraded, Yahaya dismissed reports that some of them might be using charms in the attacks.\n\n\u201cWe are not worried by voodoo. It did not stop the suspects from being arrested and others that have been arrested before now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cOperations that led to these arrests and recoveries were conducted professionally, guided by our mandate, operation orders, code of conduct and rules of engagement. Our operations are strictly targeted against perpetrators of all criminal acts in our area of responsibility and not innocent citizens.\u201d\n\nWith the announcement of a new chief of army staff on Thursday, Yahaya will replace Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a military plane crash alongside 10 other officers last Friday.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",
          "summary": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country.\nIt has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects.\nBut the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook.\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria.\nKaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.\u201d \u2013 Kofi Annan.\n\nEducation is vital for any society looking to make any form of progress. In Africa, however, that is not always the case. The United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports that close to half of Africa\u2019s population is under 18.\n\nThanks to steady growth in births and declining child mortality rates, Africa\u2019s child population is expected to reach the 1 billion mark by 2055.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, one in five children between the ages of 6 and 11 are out of school. That number increases as the children get older, with one-third of youth between the ages of 12 and 14 out of school and almost 60% of youth between 15 and 17 out of school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese numbers are more startling when we consider school enrolments by gender. Nine million African girls between the ages of 6 and 11 will never go to school compared to 6 million African boys. By the time these children are adolescents, the exclusion rate for girls is 36% compared to 32% for boys.\n\nRecognising the role of education in development, the United Nations designated quality education as one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nEdtech startups are rising to the occasion in Africa. Although they do not receive as much coverage or funding as fintech or agritech startups in Africa, they supplement the job of the continent\u2019s existing educational structures. However, they face a major hurdle with low internet penetration meaning that only a few children can access these services.\n\nData from Techpoint Intelligence showing the percentage of students with access to digital connectivity in West Africa reveals that The Gambia has the highest rate of digital connectivity among school-age children with 65%.\n\nNigeria, on the other hand, has just 3% of school-age children able to access the Internet at home despite having more edtech startups than any other African country.\n\nThe sector has grown consistently, with a Briter Bridges report stating that there are over 210 edtech startups on the continent as of Q1 2020. These startups adopt different models but with the same goal, making learning seamless while getting outstanding outcomes.\n\nListed in no particular order below are 11 randomly selected edtech startups you should check out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nuLesson\n\nFollowing stints at Konga, DealDey, and E-motion Advertising, Nigerian serial entrepreneur, Sim Shagaya, founded uLesson in 2019 to bridge the gap in learning for kids in secondary schools across Africa.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has recorded more than one million app downloads and raised over $10 million from investors, making it one of Africa\u2019s best-funded edtech startups.\n\nCurrently serving students in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia, uLesson has its sights trained on the East and South African regions in its expansion plans.\n\nUsing interactive videos and focusing on producing content that students enjoy, uLesson seeks to augment the existing educational systems.\n\nIt can be accessed through an Android device or a Windows PC for a relatively affordable fee. Depending on what plan a user chooses, they could end up paying as little as $6 monthly.\n\nTuteria\n\nIn 2005, Godwin Benson was not paid for tutoring services he rendered. Worse still, the man who hired him searched for two months before he found him.\n\nThat experience inspired him to co-found Tuteria \u2014 an online platform that connects people who want to learn to people who can teach them \u2014 with Abiola Oyeniyi in 2015.\n\nSome of the startup\u2019s investors include Microsoft, Facebook, and the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nPrepClass\n\nPrepClass was founded in 2014 by Chukwuwezam Obanor and Olumide Ogunlana to address the severe shortage of trained teachers in Nigeria. Similar to Tuteria, PrepClass connects learners and tutors for a fee. The startup has raised over $400,000 from investors such as Venture Garden Group and Africa Angels Network.\n\nPass.ng\n\nExaminations are an important part of the educational system. For a long time, the only resources available to Nigerian students preparing for examinations like the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) were voluminous past questions. But with Pass.ng, students have the opportunity to test their knowledge of different subjects through a series of mock tests.\n\nAlthough the startup initially focused on students preparing for WAEC and the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination \u2014 now the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) \u2014 it currently supports tests for the University of Lagos (UNILAG) diploma programme and the Federal Government\u2019s N-Power programme.\n\nM-Shule\n\nLaunched in January 2016 by Julie Otieno and Claire Mongeau, Kenyan edtech startup, M-Shule, utilises artificial intelligence to deliver personalised learning experiences to learners through SMS and chatbots. Performance data from students is then shared with parents, schools, and teachers to enhance the learning process.\n\nAmbani Africa\n\nAs more parts of Africa become urbanised, there is the danger that indigenous African languages would be lost in the process. For families that feel this way, Ambani uses augmented reality (AR) to teach young people African languages. The languages currently available on the app include isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sepedi, Tshivenda, and English.\n\nSmartix Education\n\nGhanaian-based Smartix Education develops learning solutions for students using animated videos, activities, and books delivered through an Android and web app. It also runs a vacation school for students in kindergarten and upwards.\n\nSyafunda\n\nSyafunda was founded in 2013 by Zakheni Ngubo in South Africa to provide access to digital content. The startup partners with local content developers setting up digital libraries in places where Internet connection is limited or non-existent.\n\neLimu\n\nThe Kenyan edtech startup\u2019s name means education in Swahili, and it creates educational apps and content for students in primary school. In 2020, it was acquired by CcHUB as part of its content creation expansion plans. The idea for eLimu was conceived by Marie Githinji and Nivi Mukherjee in Kenya\u2019s iHub; the startup uses local examples to teach concepts to students.\n\nKidato\n\nPublic schools in Africa have a high student-to-teacher ratio of 1:50. An alternative is private schools which have a student-to-teacher ratio of 1:20. However, this comes at a steep price for parents. Kenyan serial entrepreneur, Sam Gichuru, founded Kidato to solve this problem after he had to take his children out of school to be homeschooled.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2021. Kidato is an online school for students between the ages of 4 and 18. It offers both regular academic classes and after-school lessons for students. To ensure that the students also have the interaction that occurs in regular schools, the school takes students on monthly educational field trips.\n\nGradely\n\nGradely provides an adaptive learning platform that helps parents and schools identify learning gaps in students and recommends specific ways to close those gaps. It was founded in 2019 by Boye Oshinaga, Femi Ibiwoye, Seyi Adelaju, and Babatunde Caleb, and counts Microtraction as one of its investors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Global Partnership for Education \u2013 GPE Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

These startups adopt different models but with the same goal, making learning seamless while getting outstanding outcomes.\n\nListed in no particular order below are 11 randomly selected edtech startups you should check out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nuLesson\n\nFollowing stints at Konga, DealDey, and E-motion Advertising, Nigerian serial entrepreneur, Sim Shagaya, founded uLesson in 2019 to bridge the gap in learning for kids in secondary schools across Africa.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has recorded more than one million app downloads and raised over $10 million from investors, making it one of Africa\u2019s best-funded edtech startups.\n\nCurrently serving students in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and The Gambia, uLesson has its sights trained on the East and South African regions in its expansion plans.\n\nUsing interactive videos and focusing on producing content that students enjoy, uLesson seeks to augment the existing educational systems.\n\nIt can be accessed through an Android device or a Windows PC for a relatively affordable fee. Depending on what plan a user chooses, they could end up paying as little as $6 monthly.\n\nTuteria\n\nIn 2005, Godwin Benson was not paid for tutoring services he rendered. Worse still, the man who hired him searched for two months before he found him.\n\nThat experience inspired him to co-found Tuteria \u2014 an online platform that connects people who want to learn to people who can teach them \u2014 with Abiola Oyeniyi in 2015.\n\nSome of the startup\u2019s investors include Microsoft, Facebook, and the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nPrepClass\n\nPrepClass was founded in 2014 by Chukwuwezam Obanor and Olumide Ogunlana to address the severe shortage of trained teachers in Nigeria. Similar to Tuteria, PrepClass connects learners and tutors for a fee. The startup has raised over $400,000 from investors such as Venture Garden Group and Africa Angels Network.\n\nPass.ng\n\nExaminations are an important part of the educational system. For a long time, the only resources available to Nigerian students preparing for examinations like the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) were voluminous past questions. But with Pass.ng, students have the opportunity to test their knowledge of different subjects through a series of mock tests.\n\nAlthough the startup initially focused on students preparing for WAEC and the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination \u2014 now the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) \u2014 it currently supports tests for the University of Lagos (UNILAG) diploma programme and the Federal Government\u2019s N-Power programme.\n\nM-Shule\n\nLaunched in January 2016 by Julie Otieno and Claire Mongeau, Kenyan edtech startup, M-Shule, utilises artificial intelligence to deliver personalised learning experiences to learners through SMS and chatbots. Performance data from students is then shared with parents, schools, and teachers to enhance the learning process.\n\nAmbani Africa\n\nAs more parts of Africa become urbanised, there is the danger that indigenous African languages would be lost in the process. For families that feel this way, Ambani uses augmented reality (AR) to teach young people African languages. The languages currently available on the app include isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana, Sepedi, Tshivenda, and English.\n\nSmartix Education\n\nGhanaian-based Smartix Education develops learning solutions for students using animated videos, activities, and books delivered through an Android and web app. It also runs a vacation school for students in kindergarten and upwards.\n\nSyafunda\n\nSyafunda was founded in 2013 by Zakheni Ngubo in South Africa to provide access to digital content. The startup partners with local content developers setting up digital libraries in places where Internet connection is limited or non-existent.\n\neLimu\n\nThe Kenyan edtech startup\u2019s name means education in Swahili, and it creates educational apps and content for students in primary school. In 2020, it was acquired by CcHUB as part of its content creation expansion plans. The idea for eLimu was conceived by Marie Githinji and Nivi Mukherjee in Kenya\u2019s iHub; the startup uses local examples to teach concepts to students.\n\nKidato\n\nPublic schools in Africa have a high student-to-teacher ratio of 1:50. An alternative is private schools which have a student-to-teacher ratio of 1:20. However, this comes at a steep price for parents. Kenyan serial entrepreneur, Sam Gichuru, founded Kidato to solve this problem after he had to take his children out of school to be homeschooled.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2021. Kidato is an online school for students between the ages of 4 and 18. It offers both regular academic classes and after-school lessons for students. To ensure that the students also have the interaction that occurs in regular schools, the school takes students on monthly educational field trips.\n\nGradely\n\nGradely provides an adaptive learning platform that helps parents and schools identify learning gaps in students and recommends specific ways to close those gaps. It was founded in 2019 by Boye Oshinaga, Femi Ibiwoye, Seyi Adelaju, and Babatunde Caleb, and counts Microtraction as one of its investors.\n\nFeatured image credit: Global Partnership for Education \u2013 GPE Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "One question that is repeatedly asked in health policy circles is, \u2018What is responsible for the challenge with implementing nationwide health policies in Nigeria?\u2019 The answer is mostly threepronged.\n\nFirst, there is the country\u2019s governmental structure \u2013 with a federation of 36 states and a federal capital. So, when policies are designed from the top-down with minimal input from states and launched, state and local government level implementation of such policies becomes severely challenged.\n\nSecondly, there is the effect of competing government priorities. Over the last decade, Nigeria has been bedevilled by terrorism, insurgency, and communal conflicts and the attendant implications across several states. This has meant that financial obligations of government have been directed predominantly towards national security, agriculture, and humanitarian assistance for the internally displaced.\n\nTherefore, there is substantial room to advocate for increasing prioritisation of healthcare in keeping with the commitments of the Abuja Declaration of 2001. At Abuja, African heads of government came together and committed to spending not less than 15% of their national budgets on healthcare. Twenty years on, only few countries on the continent have reached or surpassed that target \u2013 countries like Rwanda, South Africa, Ethiopia, Gambia, Malawi. Ironically, the ability to meet this target is not correlated with a country\u2019s wealth index, as evidenced by lower-income countries such as Malawi that have managed to achieve this.\n\nThe third but equally important challenge with policy implementation is limited continuity across political administrations. With each government wanting to make its own mark, there is a consistent limited continuity of certain healthcare programmes across administrations. Subsequent administrations view specific programmes as initiatives of past leaders, with a tendency to veer off in a completely different direction to the detriment of valuable policies and programmes with potential to positively impact health outcomes.\n\nGetting to a place where the people most affected, are consistently put at the heart of health and development policies, is key to achieving the successful implementation of policies that has long eluded us in Africa.\n\nDr. Oreh is a consultant family physician and Country Head of Planning, Research and Statistics for Nigeria\u2019s National Blood Transfusion Service.",

She was best known for her role in the popular sitcom \u201cEveryday People.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe regret to announce that IFEY ONWUEMENE has gone to be with the Lord, with a deep sense of grief but entire surrender to God Almighty,\u201d Anozie-Young wrote.\n\n\u201cIFEY ONWUEMENE was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Her womb was removed, but she has been battling the ailment for many years now.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, even after eight sessions of chemotherapy, the doctors told her she had reached stage 4. However, we are not sure if she was given the wrong diagnosis or being treated with the wrong chemo, because she still felt pains on her upper abdomen and her tummy was bloated.\n\n\u201cIfy spent more than N10m, being helped with donations by her fellow actors and other Nigerians. A GoFundMe account was opened for her, but it did not yield much. She had to go for draining every two weeks at a cost of N280,000, but only 3 litres of liquid can be removed at a time so that her heart is not affected.\n\n\u201cIFEY has finally gone to rest, today 25th May 2021. May her soul rest in perfect peace. Amen.\u201d",

Yes, the Governor of Ebonyi State pulls no punches whenever he decides to speak. No tongue-in-cheek, he just fires from all cylinders.\n\nThat was what he did when he was special guest at the State House Press Briefing in Abuja last week. There were many issues of concern in his part of the country, and the Governor did not shy away from any.\n\nIn recent times, police stations, offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and other Federal assets have come under attack in the South East. They have been incinerated, and scores of policemen killed. Whodunnit? Leaders of the region have opted for \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 perhaps out of fear of being objects of attack themselves. But Umahi was deadpan:\n\n\u201cWe are the ones killing ourselves, not foreigners. We have to tell ourselves the truth, if we want the problem solved.\u201d\n\nThe Governor said he may not agree with the formation of the militant wing of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), known as ESN (Eastern Security Network), \u201cbut we know why it was formed.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a direct reaction to the invasion of the region by both local and foreign herdsmen, who attack farmers particularly, destroy their crops, rape their wives, and kill people.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want herders killed, but neither should they violate our cultural values. That was why we formed Ebube Agu, which is a kind of regional security group. It has been signed into law to protect our people. If you cause problems in any part of the South East, Ebube Agu will deal with you, no matter who you are.\u201d\n\nAsk Umahi what the South East really wants. A country of their own, as is being championed from some quarters? He demurs:\n\n\u201cWe are Nigerians. We want to belong to a fair, just, equitable Nigeria. We want a country of fairness, equity, justice, and freedom. I want a Biafra of equity and justice, not one of killing policemen and burning of INEC offices. There\u2019s no region that does not have issues in the country, but grievances should be looked at through dialogue, and not by taking the laws into your hands. Killing is not the character and culture of our people. It is sheer criminality.\u201d\n\nThe Governor laments that 99% of security agents killed so far in the region \u201care from the South East. They are our brothers and sisters. It is not good for us. We shed tears. Our people should be wise, and deploy wisdom at this critical time.\u201d\n\nHe said the agitators should give leadership of the region their demands, \u201c and we will address them within six months. But we are not with them in insulting the President of the country. It is foolishness.\u201d\n\nOne way to combat poverty, insecurity and restiveness is through development. Gov Umahi spoke on giant strides in Ebonyi, a State he said he met in massive poverty, but which he is trying strenuously to turn around.\n\n\u201cWe inherited poverty, and have demolished it, though there are still some traces. Even Jesus says the poor will always be around. But we do our best, and wish we can do more.\u201d\n\nTalking further on development as means of combating poverty, Gov Umahi spoke of keeping the people gainfully busy through agriculture, industry, rice mills, cassava flour processing, ultramodern shopping malls with over 50,000 stalls, road networks, a medical university being constructed, colleges of nursing, of technology, and human development generally.\n\n\u201cAbout 95% of our projects are done through direct labour. This ensures that there\u2019s no capital flight from the State.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything to increase value for education. When you are educated, you won\u2019t carry guns at the instigation of juju men, who promise invincibility. It doesn\u2019t happen. You can\u2019t be brainwashed into believing in a shrine that gets destroyed, and the shrine can\u2019t respond.\u201d\n\nGov Umahi loves President Buhari, and had always done so before he moved to the All Progressives Congress (APC). And the President returns the gesture duly. I recall that it was Ebonyi that the President first visited in his first term, and stayed the night. He was even invested with two chieftaincy titles by the royal fathers.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is doing a lot for the country,\u201c Gov Umahi says. \u201cHe started early on agriculture, otherwise, there would have been severe hunger in the country today. Lots of opportunities have been provided by the Federal Government, but our people don\u2019t want to work again. Government has come with great empowerment opportunities, and they need to embrace and utilize these things.\u201d\n\nNow, to perhaps the biggest issue in the country. Presidency in 2023. Which region should get it? Was that the reason Umahi decamped to the APC? And would he stay, if he didn\u2019t get the party\u2019s ticket? The man is as frank as ever:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in APC, but it\u2019s not conditional. It is not predicated on the party zoning its presidential ticket to the South East. If we are talking of justice, it is the turn of the South East. No good person from the region will preach seceding. We\u2019re better off in South East under a fair Federal Government. We used to be houseboys and house girls before Ebonyi State was created. But not anymore. All we are asking for is a fair Nigeria. But I\u2019m not in APC just because of presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nA parting shot from the Governor?\n\n\u201cWe can do with more patriotism in Nigeria.

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nFormer President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday, visited the Obasanjo Market, at Oluyole Estate, Ibadan, with a promise to assist in having better structure and government backing.\n\nThe visit at the Day Old chicks market recorded a massive turnouts of traders and buyers, who welcomed the former President amid pomp and ceremony. Most of them abandoned their goods to joining in praise singing and eulogizing him.\n\nIn a release by his Special Assistant on Media to the former President, Kehinde Akinyemi stated that Obasanjo, who arrived the market at about 9.20am, took time to go around the long and congested market.\n\nThe tour was conducted by Deacon Sunday Agusa, the General Manager of the Obasanjo Farms, Ibadan, located in the area.\n\nThe elated former President said his attention was drawn to the presence of the market by his staff and that his name has been used to grow the market, becoming national and international market on day-old chicks in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cmy attention was drawn to the situation here and I decided to come and see things myself. Consciously and unconsciously, you have developed into a source of market, you buy, you sell, you interact. And this has made it very popular far and near, even though, it was not structured.\n\n\u201cSo, what remains is that if we don\u2019t want them to send us away from here, we have to structure ourselves in order to continue to benefit from the gains of trading our day-old chicks.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying in essence, is that, I will endeavour to see the Governor to provide for us an alternative place if this area is not available for you bringing your hatch chicks or you coming to buy our chicks here. We have to plan against any government coming to send us away and that is the structure that I am talking about,\u201d Obasanjo disclosed, as the crowd responded overwhelmingly to his submission.\n\nThe leader of the Day Old Chicks Merchant Association of Nigeria (DOCMAN), Olaiya Ogunmoyewa at the Obasanjo Day Old International Market, appreciated the coming of the former President, saying the visit had lessened their fears on the future of the market. He said the Obasanjo had spoken their agitation \u201cand we\u2019re pleased with what you have told us.\n\n\u201cThis is what was on our mind.

We were true to our word,\u201d an official of the transition government told newsmen while speaking on condition of anonymity. Family members confirmed that the two men had returned to their homes in the capital Bamako.\n\nThe development came a day after military officials said the country\u2019s transitional president and prime minister had resigned while in detention.\n\nThe mediator who left Mali on Thursday is billed to present a report to the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government for further decisions to be taken on the new situation in Mali.\n\nHe was accompanied on the mission by Ghana\u2019s foreign minister and chair of ECOWAS Council of Ministers Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, President of the ECOWAS Commission Jean-Claude Kassi Brou and the ECOWAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security Francis Benhazin.

          "text": "Some well-meaning Nigerian youths have urged the National Assembly to ignore the bill seeking to scrap the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, describing it as \u201cobnoxious.\u201d\n\nThe Concerned Nigerian Youth, CNY, said discontinuing the scheme will jeopardise the chances of a greater and united Nigeria as the opportunities for acculturation will be totally lost.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, Obande Gideon Obande made this known in a statement titled \u2018Move by Green Chambers to Scrap NYSC Scheme; A Major Drift Away from National Unity\u2019 on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Obande, the NYSC was established to unite Nigerians after the civil war.\n\nHe noted that the scheme has evolved since then and it\u2019s now responsible for more than 40 percent inter-ethnic marriages in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe National Youth Service Corps scheme established on 22 May, 1973, with one primary purpose: \u2018Uniting Nigerians across boards.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis service to the nation as insignificant as it is painted to look today at the floor of the green chambers, is responsible for more than 40 percent inter-ethnic marriages in our nation.\n\n\u201cThe reorientation of young minds viz-a-viz the culture and tradition, religion of other Nigerians have had a better perception,\u201d he said.\n\nObande further noted that as tensed as the nation looks along the different lines of divide, the scheme seems to be the only surviving bridge connecting the north and south; a legacy that must be preserved.\n\nInstead of outright scrapping, he further revealed that the expectation of young Nigerians points towards amendments to ensure that the scheme meets up with the current challenges we face as a nation in the area of security, unemployment and value reorientation.\n\nHe, therefore, warned that an attempt to scrap the NYSC will rather jeopardise the chances of a greater united Nigeria, one envisaged by our leaders past.\n\n\u201cIn view of the aforementioned and many other reasons, as Concerned Nigerian Youth we align our position with other progressives calling for total disregard for this bill,\u201d Obande added.\n\nHe, however, called on all members of the Nigerian parliament with the interest of the Nigerian youth at heart to rise up against the obnoxious bill.",

Real finished second in La Liga, two points behind Atletico, and were knocked out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage and the Copa del Rey in the round of 32 to end the season without a trophy for the first time in 11 years.\n\nOff the field, Real were one of the key players behind the failed Super League breakaway with the club president, Florentino Perez, repeatedly defending the plan and engaging in a war of words with Uefa that shows no sign of slowing down.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to respect his decision and show him our appreciation for his professionalism, dedication and passion in all these years, and for what his figure represents for Real Madrid,\u201d a club statement read.\n\n\u201cZidane is one of the great myths of Real Madrid and his legend goes beyond what he has been as a coach and player of our club. He knows that he is at the heart of Real Madrid and that Real Madrid is and will always be his home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option that Zidane could replace Maurio Pochettino at PSG. He\u2019s unpredictable and he could well head back to France if Pochettino decides to return to Tottenham.\n\n\u201cIt was thought that Juventus was an option before they turned to Massimiliano Allegri to replace Andrea Pirlo.
