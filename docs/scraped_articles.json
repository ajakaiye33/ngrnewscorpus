We have heard so many words without action from the government, we have had enough rehearsed condolence messages from the government, what we demand now is an end to the massacre of Nigerians under whatever guise,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that the council equally took notice of the pervasive corruption in Nigeria and are concerned about the level of corruption in governance in Nigeria, saying that it has to a large extent impeded development in the country, resulting in infrastructural decay across the country.\n\n\u201cThe humongous annual budget of the country has not in any way translated to development,\u201d he observed.\n\nThey opined that there are no commensurate development indices vis-a-vis the trillions of naira released every year as capital expenditure, stressing that the reason for this gap is not farfetched as it is buried in the graveyard of corruption.\n\nThe group stressed its uncompromising position on the need for a united Nigeria and cautioned against inflammatory statements ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nTo this end, the group urged politicians to put the interest of the country above themselves as they should see themselves as vehicles for national cohesion and not as agents of disunity, saying that it is the reason why it noted with serious concern some unguarded utterances by political actors across the country, especially with regards to the 2023 general elections.\n\nIt stated that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has a big role to play, saying that it must give all interested parties equal opportunities in the 2023 general elections to ensure the emergence of credible leaders.\n\nThe group urged Nigerian youths to participate actively in 2023 politics, urging political actors to be fair to all political zones in elections.",

We shouldn\u2019t allow ISWAP to grow.\n\n\u201cISWAP are more sophisticated, better funded and more educated and we shall do everything possible to defeat ISWAP. Otherwise, what Boko Haram did will be a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThis is an early warning system. Nigerian Army has to restrategise and defeat ISWAP.\n\n\u201cISWAP will be a threat to the entire nation. Because of the proximity of Sub-Saharan Africa, they are coming from Libya and others and resettling here,\u201d he added.\n\nZulum restated the need for external assistance.\n\n\u201cI have said it time without number that in addition to what we are doing, there is a need for government to rethink and look into the possibility of hiring mercenaries.\n\n\u201cAmerica, Britain and many countries that are stronger than Nigeria, used to seek support outside.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong (with the idea) because this problem has been compounded. And it\u2019s not easy for us to solve the security challenges that we are having now.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria is providing a lot of things and Federal Government is buying equipment, there is the need for us to seek support from external agencies to defeat these insurgents once and for all before the matter will reach other parts of the nation,\u201d the Borno governor said.\n\nHe called for the sanitisation of the armed forces recruitment process, adding that funding remained critical.\n\nThe governor recounted losses suffered by the Northeast to terrorism, including over 5,000 classrooms, 900,000 homes, 713 energy distribution lines and over 1,600 public water sources.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of the recovery and peacebuilding assessment by the World Bank, European Union and the United Nations, revealed that the total sum of our $6.9 billion was lost as a result of the insurgency the entire Northeastern states, out of this Borno State accounts for over two-third per cent.\n\n\u201cWe have a total of 49,311 widows and about 49,974 orphans. These are official figures, the unofficial figures are more than these,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, financiers of terrorism will soon have their day in court, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said in Abuja.\n\nHe spoke during a briefing on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption fight.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cNFIU in 2020-2021 revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria, 424 associates/supporters of the financiers, involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureau De Change, in addition to identifying 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and seven co-conspirators.\n\n\u201cThe analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets.\n\n\u201cAlso, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.43 in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.82 in withholding tax due to the government.\n\n\u201cNFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery.\n\n\u201cOn terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, 2020-2021, the organisation returned fraudulently-obtained funds totalling US$103,722,102.83, \u00a33,000; 7,695 Singapore Dollar and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims who came into the country.\u201d\n\nThe minister said the Whistle-Blower policy has led to the recovery of N700 billion.\n\nHe said to check corruption, the government would enforce Executive Order 10 on financial autonomy for the three arms of government.\n\nHe confirmed that the Accountant-General of the Federation has been directed to deduct, from source, funds due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation of states that fail to comply.\n\nHe faulted the naysayers and Transparency International for not taking into cognisance the far-reaching anti-corruption initiatives of the Buhari administration.",

          "text": "No venue in party\u2019s notification letter to INEC\n\nState chairmen inaugurated\n\nLast-minute push by some party chiefs to shift the All Progressives Congress (APC) convention date has collapsed.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari staved off pressure from lobbyists, insisting that the February 26 date is sacrosanct.\n\nFollowing this, the APC caretaker committee wrote a February 2 letter informing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the convention date and to seek its monitoring of the process. But the letter curiously did not indicate the venue of the convention.\n\nAn INEC source, who confirmed the receipt of the letter yesterday, said non-indication of the venue did not breach any rule. He added that the party\u2019s letter was within the 21-day timeline required by the Electoral Act for a party to notify the electoral agency of its convention date.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlso yesterday, the party inaugurated 34 of its 36 state chairmen, as well as that of the FCT. Sokoto and Kano chapters were left out.\n\nCaretaker Chairman and Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni was absent at the ceremony, which was supervised by Caretaker Secretary John James Akpanudohede.\n\nBuni was at the Presidential Villa to present Senate Deputy Minority Leader Emmanuel Bwacha to the President, having defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC.\n\nThe President, who linked the crises rocking the ruling party to the delay in the conduct of the convention, said the exercise should not be shifted.\n\nA source said: \u201cPresident Buhari stood his ground by being adamant on February 26 for the convention. He felt the party ought to go beyond its caretaker structure. He is also conscious of the fact that the party must prepare for primaries for the 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cAnd the tension over the convention in APC has deepened the cracks in the party. He demonstrated a strong will in opposing moves to shift the convention date.\n\n\u201cWhat guided the President was the unanimous decision of the governors to hold the convention on February 26. The President saw no reason for any postponement again.\n\n\u201cWith this, all is set for the national convention of APC.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for the African Union (AU) Summit further blocked the anti-convention forces from having access to the APC leader.\n\nAccording to the source: \u201cBuhari shut his doors against lobbyists seeking the postponement of the convention. His trip to Ethiopia for the AU meeting foreclosed any other option than for the CECPC to notify INEC.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the party, the President will be angry if the caretaker committee fails to meet up with the Friday deadline to notify INEC of the agreed date of February 26.\n\n\u201cIt was an ambush which left proponents of convention shift stranded.\u201d\n\nHowever, an investigation by our correspondent revealed that the ruling party notified INEC of its convention in a letter with reference number APC/ NHDQ/ INEC/19/022/ 14.\n\nThe said letter was delivered to INEC and acknowledged by the electoral agency on February 3.\n\nThe source said: \u201cIt is, however, curious that APC did not indicate the venue of the convention in its letter. It is unclear why the party did so. This is not in line with official practice and precedent.\n\n\u201cConvention is a constitutional obligation of a political party as enshrined in Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution. So, APC is not doing INEC any favour, it has to comply with the rules regulating such an obligation.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting another letter on the venue of the APC national convention.\n\n\u201cSection 223 says: The constitution and rules of a political party shall (a) provide for the periodical election on a democratic basis of the principal officers and members of the executive committee or other governing body of the political party.\u201d\n\nInvestigation showed that INEC was notified after the President declined entreaties from three governors and other anti-convention elements to shift the February 26th date.\n\nThirteen aspirants are jostling to lead APC with no one ready to step aside.\n\nIn the race to lead the APC are: former governors Abdul-Aziz Yari (Zamfara); Umar Tanko Al-Makura (Nasarawa); Ali Modu Sheriff (Borno); George Akume (Benue); Danjuma Goje (Gombe) and Isa Yuguda (Bauchi).\n\nOthers are: Mallam Saliu Mustapha; Senator Sani Mohammed Musa; Sunny Sylvester Monidafe; Mohammed Estu; Alhaji Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi and Bawa Bwari.\n\nAlthough the Chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee (NEC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu was said to be interested, he has not confirmed or denied the speculation.\n\nThe CECPC was inaugurated on June 25, 2020, following the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAlthough it was meant to be an interim administration with a six-month mandate, the Caretaker Committee\u2019s tenure was extended in December 2020 for another six months.\n\nBut in June last year, the committee was only directed by President Buhari to draw a timetable for congresses at all levels in preparation for the convention.\n\nWhile party members were expecting the exercise to hold in December 2021, the party was enmeshed in a crisis of an appropriate date for the convention.\n\nThe APC governors intervened on January 16 and fixed February 26 for the convention against the committee\u2019s wish for more time.\n\nIt was gathered that those opposed to the national convention were banking on the Adamu Committee\u2019s Interim Report for the extension of the tenure of CECPC.\n\nA source, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cThere is tension in APC following the uncovering of plans to postpone the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\u201cSome forces/ groups in the party want to shift the convention until when it is too tight for APC and the party will be left with no choice than to pick their anointed presidential and vice-presidential candidates. That is the bigger picture of the plot.\n\n\u201cAs part of the game, the same forces/ groups will want the CECPC to conduct presidential, governorship and legislative primaries before the National Convention.\u201d",

          "text": "When Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi is turbanned this weekend as the Dan Amanar Daura, he will join a long list of Southern politicians who have been recognised in the North and vice versa, ROBERT EGBE reports.\n\nWhen the Emir of Borgu in Niger State, (Senator) Haliru Dantoro Kitoro III (Mai Borgu) on February 26, 2006 turbaned All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the Jagaba of Borgu and his wife Senator Remi Tinubu as the Yun Bana Jagaba of Borgu, not many could have imagined how well the title would resonate with Nigerians.\n\nNine years later, rapper and songwriter Ycee rode on the popularity of the title and dropped his 2015 hit track \u2018Jagaban\u2019 to the delight of music fans across the country.\n\nThe conferment of traditional titles is one of the ways indigenous institutions thank and encourage their illustrious sons and daughters and, when conferred on non-natives, help to bridge the sometimes distant gap of Nigeria\u2019s uneasy unity.\n\nSeveral Nigerians and even foreigners have been so honoured. While some may just be able to boast of just one, there are some who can boast of more than six traditional titles conferred on them by their local traditional rulers and other community heads.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThey are conferred with traditional titles in recognition of their impact in the community and across the nation.\n\nOn Saturday, it will be the turn of Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi, who would be turbaned as the Dan Amanar Daura. The ceremony will take place at the palace of the Emir of Daura, Umar Farouq Umar.\n\nHis title, Dan Amana Daura which means \u2018the trusted one of Daura\u2019 was chosen to represent what Amaechi means to Katsina State and by extension, the North.\n\nThe proposed honour follows the level of development the minister is usually credited with attracting to the state as well as the North, and by extension for the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSome of the projects that influenced the honour are the monumental railway project that connects the North and most recently, the University of Transport sited at Daura.\n\nWithout a doubt, Amaechi\u2019s support for President Buhari over the years\u2014 seen by loyalists as his love for the North\u2014 is a major factor and which resulted in his role as a two-time Director-General of Buhari\u2019s Presidential campaign in 2015 and 2019, and his appointment as Minister of Transportation in 2015, reappointed in 2019.\n\nFor many observers, the new title shows the esteem to which Amaeachi is held in the president\u2019s state.\n\nTransport varsity\n\nTouted as the first of its kind in Africa, the University of Transport in Daura is expected to bring rapid development to Nigeria\u2019s transport sector and generate employment opportunities for Nigerians.\n\nThe university will, among others, assist to build the capacity of Nigerian professionals, technicians and human resources in the transportation sector and also to fast-track technology transfer and Nigerian content in contracts, science, engineering and technology.\n\nAccording to the minister, the project was part of the federal government\u2019s efforts to develop qualified manpower that would manage the many railways facilities across the country and other transportation facilities.\n\nThe ground-breaking ceremony for the project was performed by President Buhari on December 2, 2019 and according to the minister, the N18billion ($50million) university was gotten free of charge from the Chinese government as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).\n\nHe further explained that the rationale for the university is to acquire technology needed to operate the railway system being built by China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) when the Chinese withdraw.\n\nThough not in the original plan, the minister also directed the contractors to include a primary and secondary school in the master plan to cater for the schooling needs of children of families who will be working there.\n\nConnecting the North\n\nPerhaps from the award organiser\u2019 perspective, another plus for the minister is how he connected the North through rail. Already, Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil has started work on the $1.8bn railway track that will link Nigeria and Niger in West Africa.\n\nTo kick it off, a ground-breaking ceremony was held at the site of a proposed station in Makira in Katsina State. When completed, it is expected that the North will be better off for it.\n\nAlso, according to the minister, construction of the 284 kilometres Nigeria-Maradi Standard Gauge Rail line will enable interconnectivity with countries in the West African sub-region for the promotion of trade and commerce.\n\nThe plan to begin linking the northern cities of Kano and Kaduna will be funded from the government budget while Chinese financing is awaited to boost it to completion.\n\nWith the forthcoming conferment of the royal title by the Daura Emirate as a mark of honour and reward for his outstanding services, the people of Daura through the Emir will convey their respect and appreciation of Amaechi, the \u2018Dan Amana of Daura Kingdom\u2019.\n\nPolitically motivated honour?\n\nIs the timing of the award by Daura Emirate in the build-up to the 2023 presidential election, suggestive of political motivation?\n\nNo, said, former deputy majority leader of the Senate, Silas Zwingina. Zwingina said the recognition accorded to the minister is because of his outstanding performance and leadership qualities.\n\nHe said the Daura Emirate considered the numerous achievements recorded by the minister in the transport sector in Nigeria and by extension the Daura community.\n\nHe said rather than perceive such gesture as politically motivated, attention should be shifted to the merits of the projects executed by Amaechi.\n\nDescribing the development as most welcome, the former lawmaker said it was the culture of the Daura Emirate to show appreciation and single out those who have impacted on their lives.\n\n\u201cIt is the culture of the people to reward and single out those who have done something for the community that will remain with them for life. It is totally out of politics and nobody should read any extra ordinary meaning to it. The kind of projects that the Minister has put in the country, has put in Daura, I\u2019m sure the President did not request for them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dThe Minister came up with them himself and considered it worthy to put those projects there and the Federal Executive Council approved them. There is the University of Transportation and the railway line that would pass through the emirate. The most interesting thing is that the university is a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project. That is to say that they are practically free of charge to government as it\u2019s compatible to the actual rail projects the Chinese are executing.\n\n\u201cThe Ministers that haven\u2019t thought about that, or if they have, I\u2019m not aware that anyone is doing Corporate Social Responsibility projects the way it is done by Amaechi. So, I commend him sincerely for that because it\u2019s either there would have been no Corporate Social Responsibility projects in the manner of the University, or it would have been diverted.\n\n\u201cThe gesture by Amaechi is beyond Daura. The spirit is that every multinational company that has a big project here should have a Corporate Social Responsibility project that is visible, identifiable and publicized in the manner the Daura Community has done.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the timing of the event, Zwingina said: \u201cThere is nothing extraordinary with the timing. It is just about a Community that has learned to show appreciation to a man who has done them good, a man who has served this nation so well, very diligently and producing outstanding results both as a minister and Director-General of President Buhari two successful campaigns.\n\n\u201cA man who they so trusted and have decided to turban him with such a very prestigious title as their \u2018Dan Amanar\u2019. Honestly, Amaechi truly deserves the title and I think we should see it that way, on its merit and not otherwise.\u201d\n\nSoutherners, Northerners with cross regional traditional titles\n\nLike Amaechi, other Southerners have also been conferred with titles in the North.\n\nThey include the Jagaba of Borgu Kingdom in Niger State.\n\n\u2018Jagaba\u2019 meaning \u201cleader of warriors\u201d, was also birthed from the phrase \u201cJa a gabar Borgu\u201d, which means a leader of Borgu city.\n\nThe Emir of Bauchi Dr. Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu and members of Bauchi Emirates Council have also conferred on former President Goodluck Jonathan the Jigon Bauchi title.\n\nJonathan was conferred with the title during his visit to Bauchi to witness the naming of the Sabon Kaura to Miri Road after him.\n\nFormer Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha, who represents Imo West in the Senate, bears the traditional title of \u201cDan Jekan Sokoto\u201d.\n\nIt was conferred on him by the Late Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammadu Maccido (CFR).\n\nOkorocha is also the Omorodun of Yoruba land; the Okala of Ehie; the Talban Gwagwalada and Uban Talakawa\n\nAnother APC member and former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, was conferred with the traditional title of \u201cSadaukin Shinkafi\u201d by Shinkafi Emirate Council in Zamfara.\n\nMany Northerners have also been honoured with traditional titles in the South. No least among them is President Buhari.\n\nThe Enyi of Aba in Abia, His Imperial Majesty Eze Isaac Ikonne, in 2014 honoured the then presidential aspirant Buhari, with the chieftaincy title: Ogbuagu 1 of Igboland which literally means the lion killer, a metaphor for a champion.\n\nBuhari, again in 2018 picked up the title Ikeogu 1 of Igboland (fighter for Ndi Igbo) in the Bende Local Government Area of the state with over 60 traditional rulers in Isiukwuato/Umunneochi constituency conferring him with the title.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan holds the title the \u2018Nwanne Di Na Mba\u2019 (a friend in Diaspora) 1 of Igbere Kingdom title, conferred on him by traditional rulers in Igbere under the umbrella of Igbere traditional council.",
          "summary": "While some may just be able to boast of just one, there are some who can boast of more than six traditional titles conferred on them by their local traditional rulers and other community heads.\n- Advertisement -They are conferred with traditional titles in recognition of their impact in the community and across the nation.\nFormer Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha, who represents Imo West in the Senate, bears the traditional title of \u201cDan Jekan Sokoto\u201d.\nMany Northerners have also been honoured with traditional titles in the South.\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan holds the title the \u2018Nwanne Di Na Mba\u2019 (a friend in Diaspora) 1 of Igbere Kingdom title, conferred on him by traditional rulers in Igbere under the umbrella of Igbere traditional council.",

Also, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption. NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.in Withholding Tax due to the government.\n\n\u201cNFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery\u2026\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nLast September, Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister, Abubakar Shehu Malami tsaid in New York, the US that, in addition to identifying and detaining high profile individuals with links to terrorism in the country, the Federal Government had succeeded in blocking the sources of funding.\n\nFour months earlier, the Justice minister had said that government would prosecute about 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers and was profiling some high-profile Nigerians strongly suspected to be financing terrorism for prosecution.\n\nNevertheless, at the media parley, yesterday, the Information Minister added that government has, so far, recovered N700 billion through its whistleblower policy.\n\nThe minister also disclosed that through deployment of the Bank Verification Number (BVN) to verify the federal government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform, so far led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries.\n\nHe said:\u201dIt is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the Administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts.\n\n\u201cLet me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture \u2013 which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure success in tackling corruption, constitute \u2013 as important as they are \u2013 just a part of the strategies to combat corruption\u2026\n\n\u201cAlso, against stiff opposition, the Buhari Administration has expanded the coverage of IPPIS. TSA and IPPIS remain an unfolding revolution in public finance in Nigeria that have incorporated transparency and accountability into the system. The use of BVN to verify the Federal Government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform has, so far, led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries\u2026The Whistle-blower Policy, an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning\u2026 is meant to encourage the voluntary disclosure of information about fraud, bribery and looted government funds, including financial misconduct and any other form of corruption or theft.\n\n\u201cThe Whistle Blower whose information leads to recovery is entitled to 2.5 to 5 percent from the recovered funds. Information and tips received are usually referred to the EFCC, ICPC, and NFIU for further painstaking investigation. The policy has helped in the cleansing of IPPIS, led to compliance on TSA and enhanced the Procurement Act 2007. As at 2020, a total of N700 billion has been recovered through the Whistle-Blower Policy.\u201d\n\nMohammed also explained that, contrary to public perception, it is not in all cases that the whistle blower gets a reward.\n\n\u201cTips or information are forwarded to ICPC, police, EFCC. They are to confirm if truly the person is a whistleblower or not. It\u2019s only when your whistle blowing leads to recovery that he/she is paid. Not before,\u201d he added.",

In all, we drifted into these two problems with nonchalance or with ease, and sometimes, oblivious of their consequences until what we think is a simple or easy problem develops into a national disaster or catastrophe.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nBorno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has urged the Federal Government to take necessary steps to stop the spread of Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP), the militant group and administrative division of Islamic State (IS), a Salafi jihadist group or else Boko Haram attacks will be a child\u2019s play in Nigeria.\n\nWhile urging the Nigerian Army to re-strategise and defeat ISWAP, Zulum said there was nothing wrong if the Federal Government requested external help in fighting insurgency as some of the advanced countries, including the United States and United Kingdom often ask for external help.\n\nThe governor also raised the alarm that two local government areas in the state were not occupied by human population owing to the inability of the military to effectively protect residents against terrorists.\n\nHe stated this at the 28th briefing by the Presidential Communication Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, decrying the recruitment process into the armed forces and other security agencies, saying unless the trend was addressed the country\u2019s insecurity challenge would continue to deteriorate.\n\nThe Borno governor said while early preparation is key towards the 2023 elections, it should not be done at the expense of losing focus on insecurity.\n\nHe lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for always granting him audience whenever he sought one saying \u201cone of the major reason why we have been succeeding in the North East, particularly in Borno State, is because of one major fundamental thing. There was never a time I requested to see Mr. President and I was denied access.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut notwithstanding all the contributions of the Federal Government, we still have some challenges. One, I said it before, a growing number of ISWAP in some parts of the state is a matter of great concern to everybody. Why? They are in the shores of the Lake Chad, again in southern Borno State. Luckily enough, I was told there was military deployment yesterday (Wednesday) to southern Borno State to fight insurgents in the Tudun Katarangwa.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cBut I think this is the early warning; we shouldn\u2019t allow ISWAP to grow. ISWAP is more sophisticated, more funded and they\u2019re more educated. And we shall do everything possible to defeat ISWAP. Otherwise, what Boko Haram did will be a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThis is an early warning system Nigerian Army has to re-strategise and defeat ISWAP. ISWAP will be a threat to the entire nation. Because of the proximity of the Sub-Saharan Africa, they are coming from Libya and others resettling here.\n\n\u201cAnd then whether we like it or not a few days ago, I\u2019 have said something about two local governments still not occupied by human population. I think that there is some certain level of misunderstanding. Some say that two local governments are under the control of Boko Haram, no. Two local governments are not occupied by human population. But whether we like it or not, if two local governments are not occupied, what does it mean? It means the capacity is not there to protect this human population to go to this local government areas.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria is providing a lot of things, the Federal Government is buying equipment, there is the need for us to seek support from external agencies to defeat this insurgents once and for all before the matter will reach other parts of the nation. This is very important, whether we like it or not, we have existing gaps that we needs to be to filled and this gap by now cannot be filled without external support.\u201d\n\nHe tasked the military to ensure immediate resettlement of people to Malam Fatori, which is the headquarters of Abadam LGA and Ogunbaden which is the headquarters of Mainari LGA.\n\nThe governor who listed various successes recorded by his administration, said the insurgency had triggered acute humanitarian and post-displacement crisis with devastating social and economic impact on the population, further deepening fragility and poverty in the North East region before the APC government came to the rescue.",

          "title": "Zulum: We Must Defeat ISWAP at All Cost Else B\u2019Haram will Be Child\u2019s Play",
          "text": "*Says it\u2019s time to consider hiring mercenaries\n\n*Canvasses change in security agencies\u2019 recruitment process\n\n*Govt tracks, identifies 96 financiers, 123 companies, 33 Bureau-de-change, others involved in terrorism\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nBorno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, yesterday, expressed concern about the increasing sophistication and spread of the terrorist group, Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the state. Zulum said the federal government must do everything in its power to defeat ISWAP now, or else the menace constituted by the Boko Haram terrorist sect would be nothing compared to what the group would do when they gain stability.\n\nHe advised the government to seek external help in the fight against insurgency, including hiring mercenaries, saying there is nothing wrong with such. He cited the fact that advanced countries, like United States and United Kingdom, sometimes sought external help.\n\nThe governor took a swipe at the current recruitment process into the armed forces and other security agencies, saying unless it is addressed, the security situation may just get worse.\n\nIn a related development, the federal government, yesterday, said an analysis by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) between 2020 and 2021 had revealed some 96 financiers of terrorism in the country, 424 associates of the financiers, and involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change. It said the inquiry also identified 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and seven co-conspirators.\n\nZulum, who spoke yesterday at the State House, Abuja, during a media briefing, however, attributed the successes so far recorded against insurgency in his state to the free access he had to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cNotwithstanding all the contributions of the federal government, we still have some challenges. One, I said it before, a growing number of ISWAP in some parts of the state is a matter of great concern to everybody. Why? They are in the shores of the Lake Chad, again in southern Borno State. Luckily enough, I was told there was military deployment yesterday (Wednesday) to southern Borno State to fight the insurgents in the Tudun Katarangwa.\n\n\u201cBut I think this is the early warning system. We shouldn\u2019t allow ISWAP to grow. ISWAP are more sophisticated, more funded and they\u2019re more educated. And we should do everything possible to defeat ISWAP; otherwise, what Boko Haram did will be a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThis is an early warning system. Nigerian Army has to re-strategise and defeat ISWAP. ISWAP will be a threat to the entire nation, because of the proximity of Sub-Saharan Africa. They are coming from Libya and others resettling here.\u201d\n\nZulum listed various successes recorded by his administration. He said before the advent of the All Progressive Congress (APC), the insurgency had triggered acute humanitarian and post-displacement crisis, with devastating social and economic consequences on the population, which further deepened fragility and poverty in the North-east region.\n\nZulum said the outcome of the recovery and peace-building assessment by the World Bank, European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN) revealed that the total sum of $6.9 billion was lost as a result of the insurgency in the entire North-east states, with Borno incurring over two-thirds of the losses.\n\nHe said the insurgents had destroyed about 5,000 classrooms in the state, and 800 municipal buildings, comprising local government ssecretariats, prisons, and traditional rulers\u2019 buildings, among others. He added that the terrorists also destroyed about 713 energy distribution lines and about 1,600 water sources, and produced an estimated 49,311 widows and about 49,974 orphans.\n\nWhile describing the above as \u201cofficial figures\u201d, he contended, \u201cThe unofficial figures are more than this\u201d. He said before now, out of 27 local governments in Borno State, at a time, about 22 of them were under the control of Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nZulum recalled that there was a time the state had only one access to road to Maiduguri, which was from Kano to Maiduguri.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the destruction was scary,\u201d he said, adding that, today, the situation is better.\n\nZulum stressed, \u201cI want to say something categorically. One of the major reasons why we have been succeeding in the North-east, in particular in Borno State, is because of one major fundamental thing: there was never a time I requested to see Mr. President and I was denied access.\n\n\u201cAnd then whether we like it or not, a few days ago, I\u2019ve said something about two local governments still not occupied by human population. I think that there is some misunderstanding. Some say that two local governments are under the control of Boko Haram, no. Two local governments are not occupied by human population. But whether we like it or not, it\u2019s right because if two local governments are not occupied, what does it mean?\n\n\u201cIt means the capacity is not there to protect this human population to go to this local government areas. But we\u2019re working with the Nigerian Army to ensure immediate resettlement of people to Malam Fatori, which is the headquarters of Abadam local government. And again, Ogunbaden, headquarters of Mainari local government.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that these two local government are under their control, but these two local governments are not under human occupation. We need support from the federal government to support the relocation of these people to these local government areas. This committee that has been constituted by the federal government will look into these matters, among others.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the second challenge was Lake Chad. He explained, \u201cWe want clearance of the shores of the Lake Chad. Again, in conclusion, while the challenge of insecurity is being solved gradually, it is not yet over.\n\n\u201cI have said it times without number that in addition to what we are doing, there is a need for government to rethink and look into the possibility of hiring mercenaries. I have said it times without number, there\u2019s nothing wrong. America, Britain, and many more countries that are stronger than Nigeria, who used to seek support outside, there\u2019s nothing wrong, because this problem has been compounded. And it\u2019s not easy for us to solve the security challenges that we\u2019re having now.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria is providing a lot of things, the federal government is buying equipment, there is the need for us to seek support from external agencies to defeat these insurgents once and for all before the matter will reach other parts of the nation. This is very important, whether we like it or not, we have existing gaps that we need to fill and this gap by now cannot be filled without external support, while we continue to build our own institutions, training and retraining.\n\n\u201cOne very serious challenge that we have, our recruitment process has to be looked into. Yes, you can just say recruitment for army, collecting notes from governors, ministers and others and the people are queuing in. As long as we are not willing to sanitise our recruitment procedures into the armed forces, police, SSS and others, we will not get the right people. This is something that needs to be done. The truth is bitter.\n\n\u201cAnd then funding is critical. Yes, funding to our military. Let us investigate how much has trickled down. The commanding officers are important; procurement processes are also very important. Then stronger solidarity among the security forces and sustained campaigns are needed to finish off the remnants of the insurgents in the fringes of the North-east. It is very important.\n\n\u201cThe resettlement needs to go hand-in-hand with livelihood support and more resources are needed to do more for the people. Greater understanding is required of the security forces to support protection, action in places of resettlement, and all over Borno.\n\n\u201cThe last, but not the least, we must not allow the 2023 general election to shift our attention completely away from the focus and restoration of peace in North-east and, indeed, other parts of the nation.\u201d\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who also spoke in Abuja while detailing Buhari\u2019s fight against corruption and terrorism, stated that an analysis by the NFIU had resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects, who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets.\n\nMohammed said, \u201cAlso, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3.90 trillion VAT and N3.7 trillion in Withholding Tax due to the government. NFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering, and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery.\n\n\u201cOn terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries. During the same period, 2020-2021, the organisation returned fraudulently-obtained funds totalling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore Dollar and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims, who came into the country.\u201d\n\nTo check terrorism financing in Nigeria, the minister explained that the federal government had deployed a plethora of tools, including Money Laundering Act, 2004; EFCC Act, 2004; ICPC Act, 2000; Department of State Services (DSS); and NFIU to deal with the issue of corruption, money laundering and terror-financing.\n\nHe said the on-going harmonisation of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) with National Identification Numbers (NIN) was also a means of tracking the flow of funds within Nigeria and, by extension, tackling terror financing.\n\nMohammed said one of the three major policy planks of the Buhari administration was the fight against corruption, with the others being to tackle insecurity and also to revamp the economy.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cIt is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts.\n\n\u201cLet me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture, which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure successes in tackling corruption, constitute as important as they are just a part of the strategies to combat corruption.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the federal government had taken bold steps to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes in the implementation of government policies, checking corrupt practices, and ensuring accountability in the implementation, as well as delivery of the policies.\n\nThe areas of reform, according to him, included the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), Petroleum Industry Act, Financial Autonomy for State Legislature and Judiciary (2020), Whistle-Blower Policy, Assets Recovery, Justice and Law reforms, and Nigeria\u2019s membership of the Open Government Partnership.\n\nOn TSA, the minister said the system had been implemented in more than 90 per cent of the federal ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) and it had resulted in the consolidation of more than 17,000 bank accounts previously spread across Deposit Money Banks in the country, and monthly savings of an average of N4 billion in bank charges.\n\nOn Monetary recoveries, Mohammed revealed that in 2021 alone, EFCC recovered a total of N152,088,698,751.64; 1,182,519.75 Pounds Sterling; 50 Emirati Dirham; 1,723,310 Saudi Riyal; 1,900 South African Rand; US$386,220,202.85; 156,246.76 Euros; 1,400 Canadian Dollars; 5.36957319 Bitcoin; and 0.09012 Ethereum.\n\nHe explained ICPC\u2019s pivotal role in bringing about structural changes in the operations of the government, especially, regarding improvements in MDAs budget utilisation, better value for money, improved project completion, service delivery and higher level of anti-corruption awareness.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cBetween 2019 and 2021, ICPC traced 2,000 projects worth over N300 billion. During the same period, 326 contractors of abandoned projects across the six geo-political zones were forced by the commission to return to site to complete projects worth N32.183 billion.\n\n\u201cThe ICPC\u2019s Assets Tracing, Recovery and Management (ATRM) project led to the recovery of cash totalling N34.346 billion and US$1.62 million between 2019 and 2021. Also, the commission\u2019s System Study and Review of personnel and capital votes of MDAs resulted in savings of N261 billion to the government between 2019 and 2021. ICPC has also secured 66 convictions from the 243 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, terrorists, in the early hours of yesterday, attacked Daddaran-Liman community in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State and killed the Village Head of Yan-Gayya, Alhaji Jafaru Rabiu, and five other villagers.\n\nA resident of the area, Abdulmalik Usman, who confirmed the incident to THISDAY on telephone, said the hoodlums also injured six persons and kidnapped scores, including children and elderly women.\n\nUsman said, \u201cThe terrorists attacked Daddaran-Liman in the early hours of today (Thursday) and killed Magaji Yan-Gayya, his house help, Mansir Danye, and four people. They also kidnapped many people, including children.\u201d\n\nHe explained that an armoured personnel carrier belonging to the Nigeria Police, which was deployed to the community to repel the terrorists\u2019 invasion \u201cdeveloped technical problem and couldn\u2019t serve the purpose.\u201d\n\nBut the state Police Public Relations Officer, Gambo Isah, while confirming the incident to THISDAY, said the hoodlums, armed with sophisticated weapons, killed five people. Isah added that the criminals kidnapped almost everybody in the community but police operatives engaged them in a gun duel and rescued \u201call the abductees on the spot\u201d.\n\nIsah, a superintendent of police, said, \u201cYesterday (Wednesday) around 2300hrs, terrorists in large number with AK-47 rifles attacked Daddara village. They were shooting sporadically. In fact, according to the DPO, they gathered almost everybody in that village.\n\n\u201cBut our men engaged the terrorists in a gun duel and they were able to rescue all the people. When they scanned the area, they discovered that five people were killed and six persons were taken to the hospital injured. Those killed include the Magaji Yan-Gayya.\u201d\n\nHe noted that terrorists, under the camp of Dan-Karami and other criminal gangs, had migrated to the state as a result of the on-going military operations in Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat is happening presently in Katsina is as a result of on-going operations in Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi states. These terrorists have been down to Katsina because that place is too hot for them.\n\n\u201cLike the camp of Dan-Karami, some groups of Bello Turji are presently in Jibia. So, that is the issue we are having now. I believe a combined operation of military and other security organisations is in the pipeline with a view to tackling the hoodlums.\u201d\n\nPDP Shades APC over Claim, Says It\u2019s Even Struggling to Lie\n\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, described the claims by the Minister of Information and Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed that the federal government had discovered sponsors of terrorism in the country as part of President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration as shameless lies from barefaced thieves, who had pawned their souls to the devil.\n\nThe PDP, which shaded the APC, had reacted to the claims by the minister that the APC government had uncovered 96 sponsors of terrorism and arrested 45 persons confirmed to be terrorists adding that the government was even struggling to lie.\n\nAccording to a late night statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the opposition party, Debo Oligunagba, the PD position was predicated on what it described as desperate attempt by the Buhari administration to whitewash itself by sending Mohammed, whose stock-in-trade was well known to assault the sensibilities of Nigerians with litany of fake claims on anti-corruption and anti-terrorism fight, when in reality the administration was sinking deeper into the abyss of failure on such planks.\n\nThe PDP said the APC administration was unsettled by the Transparency International (TI) Report, which ranked Nigeria under Buhari as the second most corrupt country in West Africa and 154 out of 180 in Global Corruption Index, given APC\u2019s humongous corruption,including the exposed looting of over N16 trillion public funds by APC leaders and their cronies in government.\n\n\u201cIn its ludicrous anti-corruption scorecard, the APC government has no response to the reported looting of $25 billion under its watch as detailed in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) leaked memo under its watch.\n\n\u201cThe APC government should give answers to the reported stealing of N165 billion in the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), the N1.5 trillion and $9.5 million reportedly stolen from Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), the $65 million frittered from the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) as well as the N90 billion reportedly looted from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the reported looting of N33 billion from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the reported stealing of over N18 billion from the rehabilitation of IDPs in the North East, the over N25 billion from the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) as well as the looting of N500 billon Social Investment Programme Fund as revealed by the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, among others,\u201d the main opposition party said.\n\nFurthermore, the PDP said in the very pathetic attempt to conceal the apparent complicity of the APC in the advent and continuing insecurity in the country, the minister laboured strenuously and claimed that the APC government had uncovered 96 sponsors of terrorism and arrested 45 persons confirmed to be terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is laughable, because Nigerians know that the APC administration habours within its rank a self-confessed terrorism apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, who superintend over the very critical Ministry of Communication and its agencies, which are very vital in any meaningful fight against terrorism\n\n\u201cNigerians ask: if the APC cannot purge itself of a self-confessed terrorism apologist, how can it claim to have effectively confronted terrorism in the country? The PDP restates its demand to the APC to publish the names and details of those it claims to be sponsors of terrorism and those it claims to have been arrested,\u201d the party stated.\n\nOlogunagba, however, said Nigerians had decoded the lying propensity of the APC and could no longer be hoodwinked, adding: \u201cLike everything in life, the lies and propaganda of the APC at every election cycle has expiry date and as such, the APC should expect the inevitable crushing verdict of the people in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Osinbajo: Democratic election only way to government change\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has reiterated its commitment to democracy, saying it has decided to move in military force to stabilise countries under the threat of military take-over. The regional bloc disclosed this after an Extraordinary Summit in Accra, yesterday, chaired by Ghana\u2019s President and Chairperson of ECOWAS, Nana Akufo-Addo.\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the meeting strongly condemned the attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea Bissau and expressed solidarity with President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and the people of Guinea Bissau. ECOWAS decided to deploy a force with view to stabilising the country.\n\nThe sub-regional body also decided to maintain the military and police components of the ECOWAS Mission in The Gambia (ECOMIG) to consolidate stability in the country.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said, \u201cThe Authority was briefed by H.E. Suzi Carla BARBOSA, Senior Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and the Diaspora of Guinea Bissau, on the circumstances surrounding the attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea Bissau on 1st February 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Authority firmly condemned the attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea Bissau and expressed solidarity with President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and the people of Guinea Bissau.\n\n\u201cIn view of these recent developments, the Authority decides to deploy a force with a view to supporting the stabilisation of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Authority further decides to maintain the military and police components of the ECOWAS Mission in The Gambia (ECOMIG) to consolidate stability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Authority affirms its commitment to stand firm for the protection of democracy and freedom in the region and reiterates its resolute stance to upholding the principle of zero tolerance for ascension to power through unconstitutional means, as enshrined in the 2001 ECOWAS Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good governance.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 also stated that the West African leaders decided to uphold the suspension of Burkina Faso from all ECOWAS institutions until the restoration of constitutional order. It called on the military authorities in Guinea Bissau to establish the transition institutions, adopt a transition calendar, and facilitate the return to constitutional order within the shortest time possible.\n\nThe West African leaders instructed the commission to ensure continuous engagement with the new authorities through the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, including African Union and United Nations, with a view to helping the transition process.\n\nOn the political situation in the Republic of Mali, ECOWAS took note of the recent establishment of the National Transition Council (CNT), as the legislative body, but expressed concern over the unavailability of the required transition calendar five months after the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, as requested by the Extraordinary Session of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of States and Government held on 16th September 2021.\n\nIt stated, \u201cThe Authority welcomes the conclusions of the 1057th meeting of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union held on 14th January 2022 endorsing all the ECOWAS decisions and sanctions on Mali.\n\n\u201cThe Authority regrets the unavailability of a new timetable in line with the decisions of the Authority. Consequently, the Authority decides to: Uphold all the sanctions imposed on Mali in line with its decision of 9 January 2022.\n\n\u201cUrge the Malian authorities to urgently propose an acceptable electoral timetable to ECOWAS with a view to enabling the progressive lifting of the sanctions. Remain seized of the situation in Mali.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, ECOWAS reaffirms its readiness to work in conjunction with the African Union and the United Nations to provide the necessary technical support to the authorities in Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali in implementing the approved timetables.\u201d\n\nThe resurgence of military coups on the continent had forced some analysts to call for the establishment of ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), a military force to protect democracy in the sub-region.\n\nECOMOG was a formal arrangement for separate armies to work together. It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members, which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were said to have established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996).\n\nECOMOG had been described as the first credible attempt at a regional security initiative in Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, stressed that as far as ECOWAS was concerned, there was only one way of changing government in the region, which was through democratic election. Osinbajo disclosed this after attending the ECOWAS Extraordinary Summit in Accra.\n\nThe vice president, according to a statement by his media assistant, Laolu Akande, was responding to reporters\u2019 questions about how the summit of the leaders fared.\n\nOsinbajo was quoted as saying, \u201cI think it has been fruitful, the Heads of State, again, reiterated the firm position that had been taken earlier that there is absolutely no excuse for a change of government by coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\n\u201cSo, what happened in Burkina Faso was considered and has been condemned by all of the heads of state and we do not think there is any excuse for it whatsoever.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment, of course, engagement is going on with the military junta and also we condemned the attempted coup in Guinea-Bissau and congratulated President Embalo and the people of Guinea-Bissau for resisting that unconstitutional attempt to change the government.\n\n\u201cAll in all, it has been fruitful and we are very hopeful that lessons had been learnt and we will not see a repeat of this.\u201d\n\nAsked about the situation in Mali, the vice president said, \u201cWe are expecting that the Malian authorities would respond to ECOWAS imposed sanctions, as you know, and we expect that at some point, the Malian authorities themselves would begin to speed up the process of transition. We expect that they would do so. We are looking forward to that engagement.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives has begun moves to transfer assets belonging to the defunct Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to the newly established Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The lawmakers had for this purpose set up an ad-hoc committee to ascertain the total inventory, assets, interests and liabilities of the NNPC before transferring it to NNPC Limited, to ensure a glossary accounting system.\n\nSection 53(2-5) of the PIA stipulates that government of the federation shall hold full ownership of the NNPC Limited with the share held by the duo of Federal Ministry of Finance Incorporated and Ministry of Petroleum Incorporated on behalf of the government of the federation.\n\nSection 53(5-8) of the PIB Act stipulates government\u2019s intention to set in motion the process of immediate commercialisation and privatisation of the operation and future private ownership of NNPC Limited.\n\nSimilarly, Section 54 of the Act provides that \u201call assets and liabilities of the NNPC will be transferred to NNPC Limited.\u201d The ministers of Petroleum and Finance are saddled with the responsibility of determining the assets, interests and liabilities of NNPC, which are to be transferred within 18 months of the PIA coming into effect.\n\nChairman of the committee, Hon. Kingsley Uju Chima, who presided over a meeting of the panel, said there were plans to meet with Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, soon. Chima said there would be an interface with Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva; Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele; and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zanaib Ahmed on the matter.\n\nThe committee by its mandate would also request yearly audited reports of NNPC from the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) to compare with the NNPC audited reports with that of the agency.\n\nAddressing the meeting, Chima said the oil and gas industry was still faced with corruption, mismanagement, crisis, and environmental degradation, lack of refining capacity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe decision of the House is in sync with the provisions of Sections 88and 89 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). It is also hinged on the provisions of Section 54 of the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act. 2021.\n\n\u201cThe legislative intervention is in alliance with Section A 1.03 of the introduction part of the Legislative Agenda of the 9th Assembly (2019 \u2013 2023), which states, \u2018The 9th House will seek to undertake reforms of critical sectors of the Nigerian society and economy with a view to improving the conditions that allow for investment, innovation and economic growth.\u2019\n\n\u201cCrude oil dominates Nigeria\u2019s economy and account for about 86 per cent of export earnings in our country. We have the largest oil and gas reserves in Sub-Sahara Africa with an estimated 37 billion barrels of oil and 188 trillion cubic feet of gas as of July 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing that, despite the abundant natural endowment, the oil and gas industry has been plagued with corruption, mismanagement, crisis, environmental degradation, lack of refining capacity, etc.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSection 54(2) of the Act also stated that any assets, interests or liabilities not transferred shall remain that of NNPC until extinguished or transferred to government six months after the determination in section 54(1).\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance and Attorney General of the Federation shall develop a framework for payment of liabilities not transferred to the NNPC Limited. If the determination and transfer is not done within the stipulated 18 months, the assets, interests and liabilities are deemed transferred to NNPC Limited.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Oil giant announces $19.29bn 2021 full year earnings\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn a big hindrance to Nigeria\u2019s hope of raising its poor daily oil production, Shell has said it would delay expansion work at its Nigerian offshore Bonga field by another two years.\n\nA report by S&P Global Platts, a financial indices provider, said the development was a major blow to Nigeria\u2019s quest to grow its crude production after a series of technical and operational setbacks, quoting sources close to the project.\n\nIn May 2021 Shell, along with its partners, signed a deal with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) in the deepwater oil block Oil Mining Lease 118, clearing the path for a major expansion of the country\u2019s Bonga oil and gas field. The development was previously shelved due to a long-standing tax dispute with Shell, the operator of the field, S&P recalled.\n\nAfter the resolution of the dispute, Shell once again invited bids for the construction of a new floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit for its Bonga Southwest deepwater oil field in Nigeria. However, the response to the tender had been underwhelming, a senior official at NNPC told S&P Global Platts.\n\n\u201cThere has been a delay in progressing with the tendering process for the Bonga Southwest field. The tenders have been put on hold till around 2024,\u201d the official was quoted as saying.\n\nA spokesman for the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Nigeria, confirmed that the contract award for the construction of the 150,000 bpd Bonga Southwest FPSO had been put on hold.\n\n\u201cThe Bonga Southwest has been deferred,\u201d he said, declining to offer further details.\n\nHowever, sources at NNPC and Shell, the report noted, said delays could be related to a change in Shell\u2019s upstream strategy as part of its net zero ambitions.\n\nShell is Nigeria\u2019s biggest oil producer, but the oil giant in recent years has complained about some commercial and security issues.\n\nIn May 2021, Shell\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors the company was focusing more on its Nigerian deepwater and gas assets after it deemed its onshore oil portfolio in Nigeria, \u201cno longer compatible\u201d with its strategic ambitions, which include a focus on climate change and net zero carbon strategy.\n\nThe energy major is currently in talks with the federal government to sell at its onshore oil assets.\n\nBonga, Nigeria\u2019s first deepwater oil field, currently has the capacity to produce 225,000 bpd of crude oil and 150 MMcf/d of gas which feeds the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant at Bonny.\n\nDeveloping Bonga South-west was set to add around one billion barrels to Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves, the report stated.\n\nShell had previously said it would develop the Bonga South-west project in three phases, with a total potential yield of 3.2 billion barrels.\n\nOutput from the field was one of the projects Nigeria was banking on to raise production to around three million bpd by 2023, NNPC officials said.\n\nNigeria, which produces high quality light sweet crude oil, has seen its production slump to multi-decade lows, due to alleged operational, technical and sabotage issues.\n\nThe country has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million bpd of crude and condensate, but in 2021 output languished near 1.55 million b/d, according to Platts estimates.\n\nDeveloping the Bonga Southwest would cost $10 billion, according to estimates by the NNPC, the concessionaire of the field.\n\nThe bulk of Bonga Southwest\u2019s resources are located in OML 118, but it also extends into OMLs 132 and 140, operated by US major Chevron, where it is called Aparo. Other partners in the project are France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Italy\u2019s Eni\n\nMeanwhile, Shell has joined the ranks of other big oil majors that had recently reported huge profits on higher oil and gas prices, announcing $6.4 billion in net income for the final quarter of 2021.\n\nIn addition, earnings for the full year soared to $19.29 billion, up from $4.8 billion for 2020, Shell said, plus a reduction in net debt by $23 billion to $52.6 billion during the period under review.\n\nBefore now, data from Shell released last month revealed that oil trading slowed down during the fourth quarter of 2021, but gas trading flourished amid the surge in demand and tight supply of the commodity in some parts of the world.\n\nChief executive Ben van Beurden said, \u201c2021 was a momentous year for Shell. We launched our Powering Progress strategy and simplified our share structure and organisation.\n\n\u201cProgress made in 2021 will enable us to be bolder and move faster. We have a compelling strategy, with customers at its core. We have ambitious plans to generate shareholder value, to decarbonise our products and to provide energy to our customers while respecting nature.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Shell said it would buy back another $8.5 billion worth of stocks during the first half of the year and raise dividends yet again, by four per cent for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe former Anglo-Dutch major, which last year dropped its Dutch headquarters to become a fully British-based company, benefited, like its peers, from higher oil prices. This is despite the fact that it shrunk its core operations after a Dutch court ordered it to sharply reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nIn response, Shell sold its assets in the Permian Basin, bringing in $5.5 billion, which it expects to deploy to buy back stock.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO. At a point, the government tried to get across to her but it didn\u2019t work out. Even now, the legal department has been directed to find out how she acquired the land and whom the land was allocated to, let\u2019s start from the basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe raised a memo, we want to know about the land allocation but it seems they are having problems sorting it out. Even the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) couldn\u2019t verify the land too. The concern has been coming from the public on why the centre has not become fully functional. Most Nigerians think it belongs to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the former First Lady had told Nigerian students in Uganda, led by their president, Mubarak Yahaya Adamu, who presented her with a merit award, that the cancer centre had not commenced operations because those who made big financial pledges during its fundraising absconded after the death of her husband.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cBefore my husband died, I intended to have a hospital. We had a launching, some people made pledges but after my husband died, they just vanished. But we have finished the first phase of the hospital, it\u2019s a very big project.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the first phase consists of about 200 rooms, four theatres and other administration offices.\n\n\n\nOne of the security guards at the ICC said there has been no activity to actualise the centre, as envisioned by Turai, adding that Turai came twice in 2016 to the site and had not been seen around the area since then.\n\n\n\nThe guard said some bandits invaded the ICC last year to dispossess them of their valuables, adding that a few items belonging to the centre were also stolen.\n\n\n\nHe said that after the incident, some policemen from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have since been deployed to secure the ICC against further attacks.\n\n\n\n\u201cSix of us were employed to secure this place and we do alternate shift, but because the bandits were fully armed, they overpowered us and beat the security guards,\" the guard said.",

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO. At a point, the government tried to get across to her but it didn\u2019t work out. Even now, the legal department has been directed to find out how she acquired the land and whom the land was allocated to, let\u2019s start from the basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe raised a memo, we want to know about the land allocation but it seems they are having problems sorting it out. Even the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) couldn\u2019t verify the land too. The concern has been coming from the public on why the centre has not become fully functional. Most Nigerians think it belongs to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the former First Lady had told Nigerian students in Uganda, led by their president, Mubarak Yahaya Adamu, who presented her with a merit award, that the cancer centre had not commenced operations because those who made big financial pledges during its fundraising absconded after the death of her husband.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cBefore my husband died, I intended to have a hospital. We had a launching, some people made pledges but after my husband died, they just vanished. But we have finished the first phase of the hospital, it\u2019s a very big project.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the first phase consists of about 200 rooms, four theatres and other administration offices.\n\n\n\nOne of the security guards at the ICC said there has been no activity to actualise the centre, as envisioned by Turai, adding that Turai came twice in 2016 to the site and had not been seen around the area since then.\n\n\n\nThe guard said some bandits invaded the ICC last year to dispossess them of their valuables, adding that a few items belonging to the centre were also stolen.\n\n\n\nHe said that after the incident, some policemen from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have since been deployed to secure the ICC against further attacks.\n\n\n\n\u201cSix of us were employed to secure this place and we do alternate shift, but because the bandits were fully armed, they overpowered us and beat the security guards,\" the guard said.",

          "title": "The north will determine Nigeria\u2019s next president",
          "text": "In Nigeria\u2019s politics, the north is indispensable \u2013 and it has always been. By the contrivance of kismet, the north has always held all the aces as the repository of political power since independence. And I say it is divine.\n\nIn the 1959 general election, the north showed its strength. The Northern People\u2019s Congress (NPC) won 134 seats in parliament (the highest number of seats). Although it polled 1,922,179 votes, it entered into an entente with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) which won 81 parliamentary seats and polled 2,594,577 votes.\n\nOwing to the alliance, Tafawa Balewa emerged as Nigeria\u2019s first prime minister while Nnamdi Azikiwe became Nigeria\u2019s first non-executive president. Action Group, Obafemi Awolowo\u2019s party won 73 seats in parliament and recorded 1,992,364 votes.\n\nEven at that time, there was the fear that the north owing to its size and number could rule in perpetuity if the principle of popular representation was exclusively applied in selecting leaders. So, it made sense that there was a modification to the rule such that one political party could not single-handed form a government. COALITION POLITICS was devised to allay fears and attenuate the suspicion of ethnic domination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe introduction of the presidential system of government in 1979 changed the complexion of Nigeria\u2019s politics. Under the presidential system, it is \u2018winner-takes-it-all\u2019 as one political party forms the government, while the loser retreats into opposition to throw a spanner in the works.\n\nBut I think, the framers of the constitution envisaged a situation where votes from only one section of the country are enough to make anyone president \u2014 which could engender sectional hegemony; so they introduced the \u2018\u20192/3 majority vote rule\u2019\u2019. That is, \u2018\u2019a (presidential) candidate must receive a majority of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least 24 of the 36 states\u2019\u2019 to be declared president. This is to ensure sufficient geographical spread and mainstream approval of any candidate.\n\nBut the fundamental thing is the majority vote which the north confidently wields. The north-west, for instance, has the highest number of registered voters \u2013 over 19 million. Kano, Kaduna and Katsina are reputed to have the highest number of registered voters. Also, the north has maintained the voting lead in every election over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason for the north\u2019s obvious advantage is not only because of its robust population, but also because the citizenry are more attuned to national politics than those down south. The average northern Nigerian will not mind leaving his business to join a long chain of people seeking to register for the permanent voter card. He will not mind standing in the rain or in the sun all day to cast his vote.\n\nCitizens up north vote collectively as a bloc and do not dilly-dally about their choices. They are either for or against you. They do not quiver or vacillate.\n\nThe north has always played the deciding role in elections; any candidate the region aligns with is most likely to win. From former President Olusegun Obasanjo, former President Goodluck Jonathan to President Muhammadu Buhari \u2013 they all had the backing of the north to win.\n\nIn 2023 when the south is expected to produce Nigeria\u2019s president, the electoral decision of the north is even more paramount. Whoever the region fancies will win. Or rather, whoever assuages the feelings; allays the fears and plays to the sentiments of the north will become president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReasonably, some presidential aspirants have made the north the centrepiece of their campaign. For instance, political mobilisation for Bola Tinubu\u2019s presidential bid began in Kano. 2500 Islamic clerics were pulled from across Kano and assembled to pray for Tinubu. Ludicrous as this may seem, it was a strategic move. The north is a conservative region and the primacy of religion is indisputable. The citizens hold religious leaders in high esteem; so they (the clerics) are the best marketers of any candidate.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo who is rumoured to be running for president began is political marshalling from Kano as well. And like Tinubu, Osinbajo has been paying frequent visits to Kano, delivering lectures and meeting political stakeholders. Other aspirants, groups, including Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo which is pushing for a president of Igbo extraction in 2023, have also started courting the north.\n\nI do not think the north is angling to retain political power in 2023. But I do think the region will support any candidate it believes will protect its interest. The north is the battleground of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAs I said earlier, this beautiful bride; the north, will give her heart to that suitor who plays to her sentiments and with whom her interest is assured and protected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe north will determine Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind.

          "title": "Detty December: New data identifies Lekki Phase 1 as Lagos\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot",
          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrobeats is the movement; it\u2019s the underdog, a mongrel that had no home and somehow, has managed to use global platforms to manoeuvre and invade the world with that melody that comes from our music.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos\n\nThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global. It has become a norm to see non-Africans identifying with Afrobeats and enjoying the African rhythm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. With the help of media companies focused on music and the Internet, Afrobeats has travelled across the globe as an internationally recognised sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Akan, Founder and CEO Afrobeat Intelligence. Moderator of the Afrobeats session\n\nTechnology has played an outstanding role in the popularity of Afrobeats. From tools that create the melody Obi Asika describes as the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to the platforms that have pushed those melodies across hemispheres and into the hearts of people with no ties with Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early days\n\nObi Asika has been in the Nigerian music industry for several decades; he has watched the industry mature from the homeless mongrel to the behemoth that it is now. He is the Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos, one of the most significant new media and technology conferences in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at Techpoint Build 2021, during the panel session themed: Afrobeats to the World: Nigerian Domination, Asika explained the journey of Afrobeats from the beginning to where it is now and the opportunities that artistes and everyone in the music business should be leveraging.\n\n\u201cI remember then when you tell people in the West, \u2018I\u2019ve got some guys in Lagos that can rap better than anyone in the world,\u2019 they\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re mad and ask who is interested in whatever young Africans have to say or do?\u201d Asika said.\n\nAccording to him, people in the West imagined Afrobeats as traditional music. Still, the sound has evolved through the years, retaining its African origins while mixed with sounds from different parts of the world.\n\nAmerican online education platform, MasterClass, traces the history of Afrobeats to the early 20th Century when Ghanaian musicians merged West African regional music with Western Jazz and Calypso to create highlife music. This was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\n\nAfrobeats continued to evolve, but its power was still unknown, not just to the West but to the Africans wielding it. A problem, Asika said, was solved by Channel O, a South Africa-based music channel.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-90s, young Africans were seeing people that looked like them on Channel O, doing amazing things. That generated a spur of energy for the next decade.\u201d\n\nAfter Channel O opened the eyes of Africans and the world of what was possible with Afrobeats, MTV Base Africa, a 24-hour music channel, continued the spur of energy. Social media took on from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMTV Base Africa changed the level in terms of quality. By the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\n\nMusic streaming platforms changed everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube,\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube, agreed with Asika on how these platforms have helped Afrobeats.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen people ask me the reason why Afrobeats is going global, I say it\u2019s the platforms. Not just YouTube, but Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\n\n\u201cBack in the days, if you didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and wanted to listen to 2Face, you\u2019d need someone from Nigeria to bring you a CD. But now, you just go on YouTube and search for it.\u201d\n\nAwofisayo also added that platforms such as hers \u2014 YouTube \u2014 try to create initiatives that can amplify the voices and talents created in Africa. An example is Foundry, a programme that helps artistes grow their presence on YouTube and \u201cbreak them outside of their market.\u201d\n\nHowever, artistes are not the only ones who need support. Awofisayo pointed out that \u201cfor an artiste to be successful, they need an army of people around them. A great producer, songwriter and manager.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, YouTube also created a programme to support songwriters and producers. It was through this program Awofisayo got to know P.Priime, the producer behind the hit song, Infinity.\n\nThe importance of music platforms can also be exemplified through the amount of money they generate. Streaming services, for example, generated about $300 million for African artistes in 2021. This number is estimated to reach $500 million by 2025.\n\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\n\u201cThat melody from our music is what drives everything!\u201d\n\nThe future of Afrobeats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala. Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager\n\nSeeing music beyond art but as a product is what Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, projects for African and Nigerian music.\n\n\u201cMusic is not just art; it\u2019s a product. It goes through a life-cycle as most products.\u201d\n\nThe reason Okpala wants music to be seen as a product is to see more investors coming into the space. Despite the growth that has been seen in the Nigerian music industry, there are still a lot of issues when it comes to funding.\n\nAccording to Okpala, the cost of producing high-quality videos is skyrocketing, and as Nigerian music goes global, it has to deliver world-class content. As it becomes increasingly challenging to create content that can compete internationally, we \u201cneed people to come into the space and fund the product called music.\u201d\n\nFor Henry Cocobassey, a Nigerian music executive and NFT collector, the future of Afrobeats is on the blockchain. Cocobassey told a story of how he collaborated with a Nigerian music artist, Challex D\u2019 Boss, to sell 10 thousand copies of minted non-fungible token (NFT) music in two weeks.\n\nHe said NFTs are like \u201ca new revolution where the artiste isn\u2019t the only one earning money off music but the fans too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Cocobassey is a Nigerian music executive, NFT collector, and CEO of Unique Sirius.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nWith a 51.44% Internet penetration rate in Nigeria, Awofisayo believes Afrobeats has barely begun to scratch the surface of what it is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more people out there that are not able to access the Internet and able to consume music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify,\u201d Awofisayo submitted.\n\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up. Though we\u2019re going global, there\u2019s still so much opportunity on the continent that is unrealised, and I think the Internet is the barrier and once that goes away, what we\u2019re going to see will completely blow our minds!\u201d She added.\n\nObi Asika\u2019s future for Afrobeats lies in the home of Afrobeats \u2014 Nigeria. To him, the conversation about Afrobeats in the future will be based on who did the most in the \u201chome market.\u201d which is the most important market.\n\n\u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria!\u201d He said emphatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "summary": "Obi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week LagosThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global.\nThis was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\nBy the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA close look at the numbers from 2021 reveals something that even casual observers must have noticed \u2014 the fintech industry keeps on pulling in the most money ($2.3 billion) of all sectors in the African tech ecosystem. In addition to that, it has significantly more startups compared to the others. Nigeria alone has 144 fintech startups, per Statista. In contrast, there are only 22 commercial banks in Nigeria.\n\nAn underdeveloped financial system, difficulty accessing credit, and a growing number of smartphone users present a huge opportunity for new and existing fintech players in Africa. However, this also means that there will be several startups offering similar services.\n\nJust like it is common to see Nigerians open accounts with more than one bank, we now see customers doing the same with fintech startups.\n\nMarking this register is another fact: these startups compete among themselves for a fraction of the market as there are still barriers to using these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparing for competition\n\nOluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, believes that fintech startups can expect to see competition from startups on the fringes of the financial services sector. This, she says, is because consumers are getting tired of having to use too many services for their financial needs.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, a lot of the digital natives are becoming fatigued with the proliferation of apps, particularly with the kind of services that we have seen on the apps in recent times. And so you\u2019re beginning to find more and more organisations who are service champions who are beginning to come into financial services such as OPay and Safeboda,\u201d she said while speaking at Techpoint Build 2021 on the topic, Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintech companies?\n\nWith this increased competition for customers, Boshoro believes that fintech startups need to start offering the whole gamut of financial services rather than focusing on core banking services.\n\nCurrently, most fintech startups in Africa are focused on one financial service. This could be payments, lending, insurance, or banking. However, the same cannot be said of some of their counterparts in other sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Safeboda, for example; after launching its ride-hailing service in Ibadan, the startup has since added airtime payments to its suite of services. eCommerce giant, Jumia has done the same, launching Jumia Pay in 2016 to allow users to buy airtime, take loans, and pay for products on the platform.\n\nSo what does this mean for fintech startups?\n\nBoshoro believes that this would drive consolidation in the ecosystem as startups either get acquired by bigger players or merge to get access to a larger customer base. This is a view echoed by Abdul Hassan, CEO and Founder of Mono, in his predictions for fintech developments.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to consolidation, Boshoro believes that partnerships will become critical for survival. Companies, she says, will have to \u201cpartner with strengths as the focus to lead the market.\u201d\n\nEven with the current players in the fintech space, there is still room for more companies capable of effectively serving previously excluded groups. However, in all this, the African customer looks set to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

The flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nSince its peak in November 2021, it has lost more than 45% of its value. Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ethereum and meme coins seeing a similar dip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market\u2019s recovery, GIG Logistics (GIGL) seems to be taking a considerable risk integrating a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means users can now perform basic crypto transactions like buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nBefore the integration is made public, it will go through two beta phases. The crypto wallet will be available to 2,000 users in the first beta phase, and then 10,000 users will be onboarded in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is made possible through a collaboration with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets using cryptocurrency. XPAD users can import their wallets into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those who do not have an XPAD wallet can create one on GIGGO.\n\nWith several crypto exchanges providing similar services as XPAD, GIGGO introduces an innovative way to onboard users to the platform.\n\nWhile the crypto space has been inundated with scams since Bitcoin\u2019s inception \u2014 making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use \u2014 linking XPAD, a new platform, with GIGL, a reputable company, creates a sense of trust.\n\nTo learn more about how GIGL is building a sense of trust to users, please read: Merging crypto with logistics: How GIGL is preparing for the future of payments\n\nLAMI acquires Bluewave to reach more Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLami Technology Team.\n\nDue to the traditional distribution of insurance policies by individual insurance agents, Africa has low insurance coverage. Add to this Africans relying on traditional channels for trade and policy implementation, and we\u2019ve seen customer satisfaction suffer, distribution costs rise, and the processing cycle lengthen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis then affects how premiums are paid. So, in 2018, Jihan Abass founded Lami Technologies to make insurance products available to all Kenyans.\n\nAlthough selling insurance directly can be challenging, they adopted a B2B2C strategy to capitalise on the trust that had already been established through channels that communicate with customers regularly.\n\nThrough an API, Lami enables businesses to provide digital insurance products to their users. Partner businesses can also use this to manage their insurance needs.\n\nTo make insurance coverage available to more people in Africa on a larger scale, the company has acquired Bluewave Insurance Agency for an undisclosed sum. Adelaide Odhiambo, who now works as the head of commercial partnerships at Lami, founded Bluewave Insurance, another Kenyan startup.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Bluewave has developed an online platform that enables clients to access micro-insurance products via various channels like USSD, SMS, WhatsApp chatbots, and web applications.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lami will integrate Bluewave\u2019s technology into its core platform, enhancing its B2B2C capabilities.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this acquisition will allow Lami to enter new markets like Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Bluewave already has a presence. Consequently, the startup will reach more customers in these respective countries.\n\nLami, already present in Uganda and Tanzania through partnerships outside of Kenya, plans to expand into Nigeria and several North African countries in 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat are mental health difficulties and when to seek help.

          "title": "Escravos explosion: Setback for local content drive",
          "text": "The environmental legacy of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry is under threat due to growing concerns about the financial and technical capacity of local operators to handle oil assets in Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country.\n\nWithin the last two months, two major environmental incidences have dampened the image of Nigeria\u2019s Content Act of 2010, a law largely responsible for the emergence of a corps of local firms trying to rub shoulders with the \u2018big boys\u2019 in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector by replicating tasks carried out by the International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n\nExperts say the latest Escravos explosion has raised doubts about the Nigerian Local Content Act, which requires all operators of oil field licences to submit a Nigerian content plan at the time of their bidding, showing how they will give first consideration to local companies and services as well as a training and employment plan.\n\n\u201cThese recent incidents will raise questions and scepticism about the technical know-how of the local operators going forward, a development that is bad for Nigeria\u2019s Local Content Act,\u201d an investor exposed to Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector says.\n\nHe notes, \u201cHealth, Safety, and Environment is one of the most delicate aspects of oil and gas business, which no serious investors will gamble with to satisfy local content.\u201d\n\nJoe Nwakwue, former chairman of, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), states that the regulators must ensure local companies did not compromise on HSE standards in line with international safety requirements.\n\n\u201cNo operation in the energy sector must compromise on safety to accommodate local content,\u201d Nwakwue states.\n\nDavid Banjo, an environment, and energy expert with a major consulting firm in Nigeria note that the recent environmental incidents have exposed concerns that some operators in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry engaged in unwholesome health, safety, and environmental practices resulting in widespread ecological disturbances, including pollution from pipeline leaks.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the regulatory framework for environmental protection in the Nigerian oil and gas sector was still very weak despite the existence of a rich set of regulations contained in the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria EGASPIN,\u201d Banjo says.\n\nFor instance, Nigeria recorded one of its worst oil spills in recent years at the Nembe oil spill at the Santa Barbara oil field operated by Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company. The oil spill lasted 32 days and caused extensive environmental damage with more than a hundred thousand barrels of oil spilled into the environment.\n\nThree months later, fire engulfed a floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel named \u2018Trinity Spirit\u2019 operated by Shebah Exploration and Production Company Limited (SEPCOL), while Houston-based Alliance Marine Services (AMS) is the beneficial owner.\n\nBusinessDay was unable to contact Shebah, while AMS had not responded to a request for a statement as of press time.\n\nOn Thursday, a note from Rystad Energy, independent energy research and business intelligence company, said the FPSO was not producing at the time of the explosion.\n\nAside from any fatalities, Rystad Energy said, \u201cThe primary concern is the potential environmental implications of the situation, which will be hard to quantify until after the dust settles and the aftermath is assessed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rystad, the impact of an oil spill from Trinity Spirit yesterday is likely to be considerably lower than the most recent large offshore oil spill, the Deepwater Horizon crisis that leaked around 4.9 million barrels into the US Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n\nRead also: Preventing gas explosions in 2022\n\nDespite the recent setbacks, Nigeria\u2019s local content under the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has recorded giant strides, which has led to the rise of so many indigenous oil companies across the value chain with the capacity to replicate the tasks carried out by the IOCs.\n\nBefore the NOGICD Act, there were only 44 registered indigenous oil service companies in Nigeria but has now risen to over 93, rigs and marine vessels owned by Nigerians were less than 5 percent owned by Nigerians. This has risen to 40 percent.\n\nFor instance, a few years back, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) sold its interests in four oil blocs to indigenous companies including Seplat, Neconde Consortium led by Nestoil plc, Shoreline Natural Resources, and 45 percent interest in OML 40 to Eland Oil & Gas Limited and Starcrest Nigeria Energy Limited.\n\nAlso, AITEO, Oando, Seplat, Eroton, First E&P, and a host of other indigenous companies are major players in the oil and gas business in the country, with the full backing of the Local Content Act implemented by the NCDMB.\n\nIn 2017, the NCDMB launched the $200 million NCI Fund, which is funded from the Nigerian Content Development Fund established by the Local Content Act, helping to fund asset acquisition and assisting in loan refinancing.\n\nIn fabrication, reports from NCDMB showed the number of fabrication yards across the country has increased, line pipes are now almost wholly produced in-country, pipe coating plants are springing up, which ultimately leads to capital retention, job creation, and skill enhancement for Nigerians.\n\nBy 2027, the NCDMB says it intends to increase local content to 70 percent, which will see the retention of as much as $14 billion within the country, annually. But the inability of local oil firms to rise up to recent oil spills and handle re-mediation works in case of emergency calls for concern, experts say.",

          "title": "APC side-steps crisis, set for convention",
          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has shown serious signs of going ahead with February 26, 2022, the date for the National Convention of the party, despite internal wrangling and negative permutations.\n\nThe party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), headed by Governor Mai-Mala Buni of Yobe State, showed the readiness by notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the convention, which is the basis for the permutations that the exercise may not hold as scheduled.\n\nThe ruling party in a letter dated Wednesday, February 2, addressed to the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, and signed by the CECPC chairman and Governor Buni and secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, invited the Commission to monitor the convention.\n\nThe letter, received by INEC on Thursday, February 3, and sighted by BusinessDay, read: \u201cThis is to inform the Commission that our great Party has scheduled to hold its National Convention on Saturday, 26th February 2022.\n\n\u201cThis serves as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) as amended. Kindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly.\u201d\n\nWith this letter, APC has fulfilled the requirement of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010), which makes it mandatory for any political party planning to conduct congress, primary or convention to give the Commission 21 days notice.\n\nThe development may have saved the party credibility loss, which some members had feared would be a lot of the broom association if it postponed again the convention.\n\nBen Nwoye, former secretary/APC state chairmen forum, had alleged some subterranean moves by some individuals to achieve certain ulterior motives.\n\nIn an interview monitored on Channels TV on Thursday, Nwoye said it would be in the interest of the party that the convention was held as scheduled.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the fact that there were internal wrangling that needed to be sorted out and other issues including some members that had either left the party or were about to, who needed to be reconciled, the former chairman of the Enugu State chapter of the party said there was no perfect situation to have a convention.\n\n\u201cThere must be issues in a political party. They will continue to exist. The situation was even worse in 2018 than what we have now. At that time, there were about 26 states with parallel structures after the 2018 congresses. We went ahead to re-elect President Buhari. What we have now is child\u2019s play. What we have now is some people trying to encourage sit-tight, and that may bring implosion,\u201d Nwoye said.\n\nSounding a note of warning to the leadership of the party, he suggested that the Abdullahi Adamu-led reconciliation committee can still continue with its assignment while the party goes for the convention to avoid loss of credibility.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit down and say until all issues are settled before we can hold a convention. If APC fails to conduct the convention as already fixed, the party will lose credibility,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that the party\u2019s ward, local and state congresses in some states bred rancour, and the party leadership is yet to calm the frayed nerves.\n\nAdamu Garba, a chieftain of the APC, who also featured at the interview session, said it would not cost the party anything to wait a little longer to allow the Adamu\u2019s committee to bring everyone on board.\n\n\u201cWe have a divided party right now. Those from the ACN, CPC, ANPP, the New PDP, and APGA that formed the APC are now pushing back because the administration of President Buhari is coming to an end. They are looking at what to get for themselves. What we are trying to avoid is an implosion. We want to give room for stability before we go to the convention. We do not want to go into the 2023 election a divided party,\u201d Garba said.\n\nA party member, who spoke with BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, had urged the APC leadership to go ahead with the convention since it was able to inaugurate the States\u2019 Executive Councils (EXCOs) that emerged from the controversial congresses.\n\n\u201cI do not see any sense in the argument that why the National Convention would not hold is because the Abdullahi Adamu-led committee is still busy with its reconciliation drive. The committee has visited some states and has yet to visit many. Why wouldn\u2019t they say, \u2018until the committee concludes its task, they would not inaugurate the states\u2019 EXCOs? So, if the internal crisis is not threatening enough to halt the inauguration of the state EXCOs, many of whom emerged from the acrimonious congresses, it should also not stop the convention after too many shifts in dates.\n\n\u201cFor me, there could be other reasons for the delay not necessarily the internal issues, which I see as a smokescreen,\u201d the party member said.\n\nThe Buni-led CECPC Thursday inaugurated the States\u2019 Executive Councils at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja amid tight security.\n\nOur correspondent had reported that the tight security at the inauguration venue was occasioned by the fear that \u201cThe inauguration may be disrupted by states where there is parallel leadership during the last year\u2019s contentious congresses.\u201d\n\nRead also: Security tightens at APC headquarters as CECPC inaugurates states excos\n\nBut with the compliance of the Buni committee with the relevant section of the Electoral Act, the party appears set for the convention, nullifying all speculations to the contrary.\n\nSection 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) provides: \u201c(1) A registered political party shall give the Commission at least 21 days notice of any convention, congress, conference or meeting convened to elect members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any of the elective offices specified under this act.\n\n\u201c(2) The Commission may, with or without prior notice to the political party monitor and attend any convention, congress, conference or meeting which is convened by a political party for: (a) electing members of its executive committees or other governing bodies; (b) nominating candidates for an election at any level; and (c) approving a merger with any other registered political party.\u201d\n\nAnother indication that the convention may hold as planned is the commencement of the implementation of the schedule of activities for the convention by the Buni-led CECPC.\n\nThe CECPC had at its 19th regular meeting on January 19 considered and adopted the timetable/schedule of activities for the National Convention; first was the receipt of the Interim Report of the National Reconciliation Committee, which was done on Monday.\n\nThis was followed by the consideration and adoption of reports of State Congresses on Wednesday and inauguration of State Executives of the party on Thursday, which is under way with the next activity being the sales of forms to all aspirants on February 14.",
          "summary": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has shown serious signs of going ahead with February 26, 2022, the date for the National Convention of the party, despite internal wrangling and negative permutations.\n\u201cThere must be issues in a political party.\n\u201cWe cannot sit down and say until all issues are settled before we can hold a convention.\nIf APC fails to conduct the convention as already fixed, the party will lose credibility,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI do not see any sense in the argument that why the National Convention would not hold is because the Abdullahi Adamu-led committee is still busy with its reconciliation drive.",

          "text": "As Africa\u2019s gaming industry sees continuous growth, Nigeria happens to be one of the leading nations in terms of gaming activities, revenues, and the number of people playing games.\n\nThis is as a result of the country\u2019s massive youthful population as well as increased access to smartphones and more internet adoption.\n\nAccording to a Renaissance Capital report, at the end of year 2021, 23 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population was involved in playing games, while the industry recorded $185 million in the same year.\n\nExperts say the growth recorded in the accessibility of smartphones in Nigeria is a reason for the popularity of smartphone gaming. Mobile games including the King of Avalon, PUBG, Call of Duty, and Clash of Kings, while football (FIFA) is the most played soccer game on PlayStation (PS) console, and are becoming more popular among Nigerians.\n\nOther popular games on the PS console include God of War, Grand Theft Auto (GTA), Mortal Kombat, Assassin Creed, Need for Speed, among others.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, Candy Crush used to be the most played game but now that mobile phones, as well as the internet, are more accessible to the younger generation, Call of Duty, PUBG mobile have become the two most-played games in Nigeria,\u201d Odysseus Vrakas, a game expert, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe trends seen in Nigeria\u2019s gaming industry are another reason for traction. While some games need a higher-end device to make them function, majority do not require an advanced technology-enabled phone.\n\nAccording to Vrakas, a majority of online games are widely compatible with 90 percent of mobile devices.\n\nAnother important trend is the amount of data online games consume. \u201cThese games consume very little data. As everyone is conscious of their data, no one wants to play a game that will burn all their data,\u201d Vrakas said.\n\nThere has been a forecast of how the gaming industry will yield more revenue as the year unfolds. In an exclusive interview with the CEOs of Nigeria\u2019s largest mobile operator, MTN, Ralph Mupita explained how much revenue they see in the digital space, including in the gaming industry.\n\n\u201cDigital for us is a very interesting revenue stream. You see dynamics coming through music, gaming and video, gaming is coming on quite interesting across some of our markets and has become a big driver for revenue for some of the tables,\u201d Mupita said.\n\nWhile the industry will see more revenues, an upcoming trend known as \u2018play to earn\u2019 has been attributed to being a major drive. This trend will also enable game players to benefit monetarily as they will earn money while they play.\n\n\u201cThere are games like the Metaverse Guild that introduce play to earn games. These games enable you to earn coins, which can translate to real-world money because it is based on cryptocurrency,\u201d Vrakas said.\n\nAccording to public sources, gaming content providers like Gameloft, Intralot, and Sirplay have partnered local gaming companies to participate in the growing success of the gaming industry by providing technology services and support.\n\nTo enjoy more gaming services and opportunities in Nigeria, experts say the government should put the right policies and regulations in place, including the introduction of a special data access package for gamers.\n\nRead also: Will the prices of cooking gas ever come down in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cMost telecom companies have streaming plans for YouTube, and that has made access easier and helps to not burn all your data on videos. As such, there should also be gaming plans to help reduce the cost of data. For example, Call of Duty is about two Gigabits (GB) in size and the updates are usually large in size. So, as much as people play it, the data consumption might sometimes discourage others,\u201d Vrakas said.\n\nAs gaming continues to thrive among the youths and other interested parties, one-way operators can ensure addiction is managed by enforcing age limits. Others include introducing a unified body that organises competition and promotes game streaming as well as competitions. Gaming should be moved from just a hobby to a career opportunity for both developers and gamers, experts say.",

          "text": "According to the Presidency, as 2023 approaches, Nigerians must elect a new leader, such as President Muhammadu Buhari, who can clean up the country\u2019s corruption and mess.\n\nFemi Adesina, the presidential spokesman, revealed this in a Facebook post on Thursday titled, PMB AND THE NDDC, in response to the current investigation into the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\nAdesina stated that the NDDC had been rife with corruption for over 15 years and that things had only begun to change two years ago.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is an interventionist agency created for the development of the oil producing region of the country.\n\n\u201cWell, it is meant to be an interventionist agency, but one thing is crystal clear. Despite hundreds of billions of naira invested over 20 years, the true intervention has been in the pockets of some select people, rather than on the region, and the lives of the people in general.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing President Muhammadu Buhari hates with a passion. Grand larceny. Expropriation and purloining. Once it\u2019s confirmed that you are filching from the public purse, you can never be his friend, no matter who you are. So, he had to bring to a halt the gravy train that the NDDC had become over the years. And no stampede, no rout or panic. The house cleaning must be done, and done well. Thorough.\n\n\u201cIn the Niger Delta, you see plenty signboards, but little or no projects. In other words, people collect contracts, erect signboards announcing the project, but the job never gets done. And the contractors get paid.\n\n\u201cWhat to do? A forensic audit was necessary. Some powerful forces mounted robust resistance, but they didn\u2019t reckon with the iron will of the President. The audit was done, and report submitted.\u201d\n\nAdesina added that if the resources pumped in over the years had been justified with verifiable projects, it would have impacted on the region, and on the lives of the people.\n\n\u201cThe case of the NDDC is symptomatic of the lot of our country. An interventionist agency is established to serve the people, and it turns to a private cash cow for a few people. Who has cursed and bewitched our country, that there are few men (and women) of probity and accountability in public life?\n\n\u201cSee what has been happening at the same NDDC, where all you saw were just signboards, and no project. About September last year, a Special Protection Unit Base 6 Barracks, built by the agency, was commissioned by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, at Omaha, in Rivers State. Money well spent, simply because there is honest leadership in the country.\n\n\u201cAs 2023 approaches, I pray that Nigerians would consolidate on honest leadership by electing somebody who can move us forward in probity and accountability. Buhari has shown us the way, may we never veer off the path again. Amen.\n\n\u201cThere has been strident clamor for a composition of the Board of the NDDC. It is inexorable that it would come, but it should never be the business as usual we experienced in the past. Honest service to the people must be the watchword. That is what President Buhari has in mind, and that is what we should get. Order is better than speed, and we will get there,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that out of the 2,260 polling units in the FCT 593 of them have no registered voters and no election would take place at the polling units.\n\nINEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, who said this on Thursday at a stakeholders meeting in Abuja prelude to the February 12 Area Council election, \u201cnoted that no materials have been produced for these units and no personnel will be deployed to them.\u201d\n\nYakubu said during the creation of additional polling units nationwide, voters were given the opportunity to transfer to some of the new polling units but did not avail themselves of this opportunity.\n\nYakubu said, \u201cFrom just 562 polling units, the commission established additional 2,260 units and relocated some of them from congested locations to proximate but underserved areas.\n\n\u201cWe gave voters the opportunity to transfer to some of the new polling units. Unfortunately, voters did not take advantage of this opportunity as we had expected in all cases.\n\n\u201cConsequently, there are 593 polling units in the FCT without registered voters, 1,328 polling units with between 0-50 voters and 546 polling units with over 1,000 registered voters.\n\n\u201cWe have already informed political parties, civil society organisations, the media and security agencies at the national level about this development.\n\n\u201cThe commission has decided that no election will take place at the polling units without registered voters. No materials have been produced for these units and no personnel will be deployed to them.\n\n\u201cHowever, voting will take place in all the other polling units. For congested polling units, the commission will deploy more than one BVAS to facilitate a speedy accreditation of voters. We will also deploy additional staff to these locations. We also agreed with the security agencies to deploy more personnel to ensure peace and order.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that voters in the FCT and indeed all Nigerians are aware of these polling units and the arrangements made for them on election day, hard copies of the polling units were distributed while the soft copy has been uploaded at the INEC\u2019s website.\u201d\n\nProf Yakubu also said this would help to seek the support of all stakeholders to ensure that these polling units are populated ahead of the 2023 General Election adding that the commission needed the support of especially the traditional, community and religious leaders in this regard to publicize the new polling units.\n\nThe INEC boss also spoke on other preparations for the FCT election remaining only nine days.\n\n.\u201dWith only nine days to the election, major activities have been concluded. Right now, the Commission is only putting the finishing touches to our preparations.\n\n\u201cContinuous Voter Registration (CVR) was conducted over a period of six months. Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) have been printed and made available for collection. There are enough ad hoc staff engaged and trained for the election. Non-sensitive materials have been deployed to the various Area Councils.\n\n\u201cNon-pharmaceutical materials have been procured to protect voters and personnel from COVID-19 in line with the Commission\u2019s policy based on the protocols prescribed by health authorities.\n\n\u201cVoter education and publicity are ongoing. Transport arrangements have been made, including motorcycles for remote locations and boats for riverine areas.\n\n\u201cWe have had several meetings with the security agencies in the area councils, the FCT and the national level on how to address potential threats to the election and secure the process. They have also been trained on the code of conduct for security personnel on election duty to ensure their neutrality and professionalism.\n\n\u201cWith regard to election technology for voter accreditation, the Commission has reviewed the performance of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) in the recent Anambra state governorship election. Lessons learnt from that election have been considered in planning for the Area Council elections.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS have been configured and ready to deploy for the election. We have also made adequate arrangements for technical support and transportation to speedily respond in the unlikely event of glitches on election day.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, election results will be uploaded to the INEC Result Viewing portal (IReV) in real-time when voting ends and votes are counted at polling units on Election Day\u201d,Yakubu said.\n\nHe also expressed happiness with the political parties and the stakeholders in FCT for their ability conduct their campaigns peacefully.\n\n\u201cThe commission is happy with the behaviour of parties and candidates in the FCT. So far, there are no adverse reports of clashes between supporters of different parties and not many incidents of hate or inciting speeches as they canvass for votes.\n\n\u201cI commend the stakeholders for their advocacy for peaceful elections. I appeal to political parties and candidates to continue to show maturity and decorum as campaigns come to a close and Election Day draws nearer.\n\nHe also said that \u201cThe 2022 FCT Area Council election is not without its fair share of litigations. Right now, there are eight cases in court challenging the nomination or educational qualification of candidates.\n\n\u201cSome of the cases are already before the Supreme Court. However, contrary to the Commission\u2019s experience in previous elections around the country, there are no conflicting judgments or orders by courts of coordinate jurisdiction anywhere on the forthcoming FCT elections.\n\n\u201cLet me seize this opportunity to appreciate the judiciary, particularly the FCT High Court, for standing firm to the shenanigans of forum shoppers and litigation-happy individuals who often waste the precious time of the Courts and INEC by litigating even the most improbable cases.\u201d",

His comment was in reaction to a statement by Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, who during the weekly ministerial briefing at the State House on Thursday, asked the Federal Government and the Nigerian Army to fix gaps in the fight against insurgency by considering, as a matter of utmost importance, the need to engage external mercenaries for support.\n\nAddressing Zulum\u2019s request, General Usman believes that such statements are highly demoralizing to the troops and as such should be stopped forthwith.

And as always, I thank you for honouring our invitation.\n\n2. As you are aware, one of the three major policy planks of this Administration is the fight against corruption, with the others of course being to tackle insecurity and also to revamp the economy. We will be having a series of thematic press conferences on these issues in the days ahead, with this one \u2013 on the fight against corruption \u2013 being the first one.\n\n3. It is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the Administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts. Let me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture \u2013 which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure success in tackling corruption, constitute \u2013 as important as they are \u2013 just a part of the strategies to combat corruption. There is also a more fundamental strategy, which I will describe as structural and governance reforms or, if you like, institutional reforms. Today\u2019s press conference will therefore look at this fundamental strategy and also highlight the successes recorded in recent times by the various anti-corruption agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB).\n\n4. Gentlemen, the Buhari Administration has taken bold measures to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes in the implementation of government policies, check corrupt practices and ensure accountability in the implementation as well as delivery of these policies. These reforms are all inclusive, cutting across all spheres of governance and not excluding even the private sector. They are the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), Petroleum Industry Act, Financial Autonomy for State Legislature and Judiciary (2020), Whistle-Blower Policy, Assets Recovery, Justice and Law reforms, Nigeria\u2019s membership of the Open Government Partnership as well as the various instruments at the disposal of the Federal Government to track, trace and stop the flow of illicit funds used in financing terrorist activities within Nigeria, among others. For those who may say that some of these reforms, like the TSA, predate this Administration, our response is that what\u2019s the use of a policy that is not implemented? This Administration has implemented these reforms with fidelity, and the reforms have made a huge impact in preventing corruption.\n\n5. For example, upon assuming office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari operationalized the TSA, a public accounting system that enables the Government to manage its finances (revenues and payments) using a single/unified account or a series of linked accounts domiciled at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The President issued a directive to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to close their accounts with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and transfer the funds therein to the CBN on or before 15th September 2015. The TSA system was launched in 2012 but failed to gain traction until President Buhari gave it a fillip. The TSA system has now been implemented in more than 90 percent of all Federal MDAs and it has resulted in the consolidation of more than 17,000 bank accounts previously spread across Deposit Money Banks in the country, and monthly savings of an average of N4 billion in bank charges.\n\n6. Also, against stiff opposition, the Buhari Administration has expanded the coverage of IPPIS. TSA and IPPIS remain an unfolding revolution in public finance in Nigeria that have incorporated transparency and accountability into the system. The use of BVN to verify the Federal Government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform has so far led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries. The Federal Government has also utilized the BVN system to verify beneficiaries and vendors in the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), the N-Power Programme and the Home Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP), among others.\n\n7. The Whistle-blower Policy is an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning. The policy is meant to encourage the voluntary disclosure of information about fraud, bribery and looted government funds, including financial misconduct and any other form of corruption or theft. The Whistle Blower whose information leads to recovery is entitled to 2.5 to 5% from the recovered funds. Information and tips received are usually referred to the EFCC, ICPC, and NFIU for further painstaking investigation. The policy has helped in the cleansing of IPPIS, led to compliance on TSA and enhanced the Procurement Act 2007. As at 2020, a total sum of N700 billion has been recovered through the Whistle-Blower Policy.\n\n8 Then, there is the Petroleum Industry Act (2021). As you are aware, there has been a dire need for Nigeria to reform the laws of its oil & gas sector, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings and about 65% of government\u2019s revenue. While some of the laws had become outdated and unsuited to the 21st century, some were simply non-existent to regulate certain activities, thereby providing loopholes to be exploited by corrupt practitioners. One of such is the P&ID case in which a company registered in a foreign tax haven colluded with corrupt officials over a set-to-fail gas processing project to secure about $10 billion award against the Nigerian government via an arbitration process abroad. Attempts to revamp petroleum laws by successive governments proved futile for over 20 years until President Muhammadu Buhari broke the jinx to push through the Petroleum Industry Act in 2021, through strong will and determination.\n\n9. Gentlemen, President Muhammadu Buhari signed an Executive Order in May 2020 that unequivocally granted financial autonomy to State Houses of Assembly, State Judiciaries as well as the Local Governments, as the third tier of government. The order also mandated the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct, from source, funds due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation of states that fail to comply. Lack of financial autonomy for the separate arms of government at the state level is a major structural flaw that is in need of reform, and this has been addressed by the Buhari Administration. Also, the financial suffocation of LGs is a major enabler of insecurity and terrorism in the Nigerian countryside.\n\nMost of Nigeria\u2019s 774 LGAs exist in rural areas where effective local governance is an existential issue. To underscore their responsibility to the people, President Buhari recently reminded the LG Chairmen of their burden of accounting for every kobo allocated to their Councils, should they fold their arms and allow the sharing to continue by the state governors.\n\n10 On Assets Recovery, the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has assisted anti-corruption agencies in devising clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been fraudulently acquired from state coffers before prosecuting suspected culprits. Part of this work has involved painstakingly reviewing existing Laws (Money Laundering Act, 2004, EFCC Act, 2004 and ICPC Act, 2000) to identify and highlight sections directly conferring powers of forfeiture on Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies.\n\nThis advocacy has led to a significant increase in the use of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Mechanisms by anti-corruption agencies.\n\n11. To check terrorism financing in Nigeria, the Federal Government has deployed a plethora of tools, including the Money Laundering Act, 2004, the EFCC Act, 2004, the ICPC Act, 2000, Department of State. Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to deal with the issue of corruption, money laundering and terror financing. The ongoing harmonization of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) with National Identification Numbers (NIN) is also a means of tracking the flow of funds within Nigeria and, by extension, tackling terror financing.\n\n12. Let me now highlight the much more-visible activities of some of the various anti-corruption agencies, all of which have been effectively carrying out their mandates. In 2021 alone, the EFCC secured a total of 2,220 convictions. That represents a 127 percent increase in the number of convictions (976) recorded in 2020, and a far cry from the 195 convictions secured in 2016, the 189 in 2017, the 312 convictions in 2018, and the 1,280 recorded in 2019. The 2021 figure of 2,220 convictions represents a 98.49 per cent success rate, with only 34 cases (representing 1.51 per cent) discharged. On Monetary recoveries, in 2021 alone, the EFCC recovered a total monetary amount of N152,088,698,751.64; 1,182,519.75 Pounds Sterling, 50 Emirati Dirham, 1,723,310 Saudi Riyal, 1,900 South African Rand; US$386,220,202.85; 156,246.76 Euros; 1,400 Canadian Dollars;\n\n5.36957319 Bitcoin and 0.09012 Ethereum. The last two are digital currencies.\n\n13. The ICPC has played a pivotal role in bringing about structural changes in the operations of the government, especially regarding improvements in MDAs budget utilization, better value for money, improved project completion, service delivery and higher level of anti-corruption awareness. Recall, gentlemen, that the Commission established the Constituency and Executive Projects Tracking Initiative in 2019 to ensure value for money for the Nigerian people and full execution of projects. Between 2019 and 2021, ICPC traced\n\n2,000 projects worth over N300 billion. During the same period, 326 contractors of abandoned projects across the six geo-political zones were forced by the Commission to return to site to complete projects worth N32.183 billion. Also, the ICPC\u2019s Assets Tracing, Recovery and Management (ATRM) project led to the recovery of cash totalling N34.346 billion and US$1.62 million between 2019 and 2021. Also, the Commission\u2019s System Study and Review of personnel and capital votes of MDAs resulted in savings of N261 billion to the government between 2019 and 2021. ICPC has also secured 66 convictions from the 243 cases it filed in court during the same three-year period.\n\n14. For its part, the analysis by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), in 2020-2021, revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria, 424 associates/supporters of the financiers, involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change, in addition to identifying 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and 7 co-conspirators. The analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets. Also, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.43 in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.82 in Withholding\n\nTax due to the Government. NFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery. On terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries. During the same period, 2020-2021, the organization returned fraudulently-obtained funds totalling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore Dollar and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims who came into the country.\n\n15. There is also the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), which was established as an institutional response to the observed deterioration in the conduct of Public Officers, especially because these behavioural changes manifested greatly in the abuse of public office for private gains. The Bureau handles, among others, issues of asset declaration by Public Officials as well as the verification of their assets. In 2021, CCB issued 125,000 Assets Declaration Forms, out of which 97,201 forms were returned. These figures represent a 48% increase in the number of Assets Declaration forms issued and an 81% increase in submission compliance, when compared with the previous year. As part of its reforms, the CCB is ready to deploy an Online Assets Declaration Portal that will allow for enhanced storage and retrieval of data, reduce delays caused by incomplete and incorrect declarations and reduced errors, among others. In 2021, the Bureau investigated several cases involving illicit enrichment, conflicts of interest, abuse of office and ethical breaches, resulting in the filing of over 200 cases before the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\n\n16. Gentlemen, we have gone to this length to let you know that the Buhari Administration\u2019s fight against corruption is unwavering and on course. This Administration has put in place structures that will not only check corrupt tendencies but will also make corruption unattractive and costly to those who may want to engage in it. Even the World Bank says when approaching anti-corruption at the country level, it is important to put in place \u201dinstitutional systems and incentives to prevent corruption from occurring in the first place\u201d, and that is exactly what we are doing with the structural and governance reforms that I have enumerated above. I want to most sincerely commend the efforts of the various anti-corruption agencies for their unwavering commitment to the fight against corruption. I also want to implore all Nigerians to join in this fight, as it is not a fight for the government alone.\n\nWith the support of all citizens, I can assure you that we will defeat this monster that stunts development and impedes investment.\n\n17. I thank you all for your kind attention.",

          "text": "A former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has dragged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) before President Muhammadu Buhari, where he has gone to seek his intervention in his battle with the agency.\n\nEFCC had on Monday filed a 17-count charge against Okorocha and others, over an alleged N2.9 billion fraud case before a Federal High Court in Abuja, hours after he officially declared his interest in running for the office of the president in 2023.\n\nOkorocha was however at the State House, Abuja, on Thursday, to intimate the president withhis intention to contest the presidency in 2023, while also informing the President of his travails with the EFCC, insisting that the anti-graft agency was being used to harass him.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after his meeting with Buhari, Okorocha said there was an existing court order restraining the EFCC from prosecuting him, hence, the president should caution the anti-graft agency against holding the court in contemptHe, however, explained that he had not requested President Buhari to stop him from being investigated, but to get the anti-graft agency to obey the law and to also order release of his international passport.His words: \u201cI used this opportunity to intimate Mr. President of what is going on between me and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the harassment and intimidation that I\u2019m getting from the EFCC, literally on daily basis, and to inform him that I have court judgment and two court orders for different judgments at different forums, which stop the EFCC from harassing and intimidating me. EFCC has refused to obey the law.\u201cSo, I have to inform Mr. President that EFCC should be made to obey the law that established it and without the law, there wouldn\u2019t be an EFCC. Also, the desperation with which they go about any affair that concerns me, should stop.\u201cAnd I reminded Mr. President that, sometime ago, the EFCC had claimed that they recovered the sum of N5.9 billion from my account, which the court found out to be untrue. In other words, they were biased and they prejudged me. On that basis, the court ruled and ordered that they should not further interrogate and harass me. This has also not been obeyed.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered the EFCC to release my international passport, the EFCC has refused to obey. The court gave damages to me for some N500million for EFCC to pay. EFCC has not paid that. Rather than doing that, on the day of my declaration, EFCC went on the press to announce that I\u2019m being prosecuted for some criminal charges of N2.9billion and no more than N5.9billion.\n\n\u201cSo, I said as the president of Federal Republic of Nigeria, and one that stands on the side of law, he should bring this to the attention of the EFCC. And despite the efforts by the Office of the Attorney General to make the EFCC see reasons and obey court judgment, to release my travel documents, and stop the harassment, they have refused.\n\n\u201cSo, I think that is some kind of desperation on the side of EFCC. And I don\u2019t know, who might be causing this, but it is appropriate that I do let them know of the injustice that is going on with me as regards the EFCC. One of the duties of a president is to protect the law of the land. And when an issue comes to an issue of judgment the duty is incumbent on the government of the day to ensure that justice is done.\n\n\u201cI came to demand for justice that you should prevail and as the custodian, as the leader of our nation, he should be made to know that such is going on. I didn\u2019t come here to say, I don\u2019t want to be investigated by the EFCC. That\u2019s not the issue; that there\u2019s judgment on the ground. There\u2019s judgment and there\u2019s order of court that I\u2019m asking Mr. President, who appointed the EFCC to recall that there was the law that established the EFCC.\n\n\u201cAnd if that law is good to make somebody EFCC, that law should be obeyed, too. So, I\u2019m not asking Mr. President, to speak on matter,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what the president\u2019s response was, Okorocha claimed, \u201cThe President said he would take up the matter, especially, when he saw the judgment. He said, we\u2019ll take up the matter and find out what is actually happening. And I hope he will do so. And I believe he will do that.\u201d",

          "text": "In a big hindrance to Nigeria\u2019s hope of raising its poor daily oil production, Shell has said it would delay expansion work at its Nigerian offshore Bonga field by another two years.\n\nA report by S&P Global Platts, a financial indices provider, said the development was a major blow to Nigeria\u2019s quest to grow its crude production after a series of technical and operational setbacks, quoting sources close to the project.\n\nIn May 2021 Shell, along with its partners, signed a deal with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) in the deepwater oil block Oil Mining Lease 118, clearing the path for a major expansion of the country\u2019s Bonga oil and gas field. The development was previously shelved due to a long-standing tax dispute with Shell, the operator of the field, S&P recalled.\n\nAfter the resolution of the dispute, Shell once again invited bids for the construction of a new floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit for its Bonga Southwest deepwater oil field in Nigeria. However, the response to the tender had been underwhelming, a senior official at NNPC told S&P Global Platts.\n\n\u201cThere has been a delay in progressing with the tendering process for the Bonga Southwest field. The tenders have been put on hold till around 2024,\u201d the official was quoted as saying.\n\nA spokesman for the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Nigeria, confirmed that the contract award for the construction of the 150,000 bpd Bonga Southwest FPSO had been put on hold.\n\n\u201cThe Bonga Southwest has been deferred,\u201d he said, declining to offer further details.\n\nHowever, sources at NNPC and Shell, the report noted, said delays could be related to a change in Shell\u2019s upstream strategy as part of its net zero ambitions.\n\nShell is Nigeria\u2019s biggest oil producer, but the oil giant in recent years has complained about some commercial and security issues.\n\nIn May 2021, Shell\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors the company was focusing more on its Nigerian deepwater and gas assets after it deemed its onshore oil portfolio in Nigeria, \u201cno longer compatible\u201d with its strategic ambitions, which include a focus on climate change and net zero carbon strategy.\n\nThe energy major is currently in talks with the federal government to sell at its onshore oil assets.\n\nBonga, Nigeria\u2019s first deepwater oil field, currently has the capacity to produce 225,000 bpd of crude oil and 150 MMcf/d of gas which feeds the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant at Bonny.\n\nDeveloping Bonga South-west was set to add around one billion barrels to Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves, the report stated.\n\nShell had previously said it would develop the Bonga South-west project in three phases, with a total potential yield of 3.2 billion barrels.\n\nOutput from the field was one of the projects Nigeria was banking on to raise production to around three million bpd by 2023, NNPC officials said.\n\nNigeria, which produces high quality light sweet crude oil, has seen its production slump to multi-decade lows, due to alleged operational, technical and sabotage issues.\n\nThe country has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million bpd of crude and condensate, but in 2021 output languished near 1.55 million b/d, according to Platts estimates.\n\nDeveloping the Bonga Southwest would cost $10 billion, according to estimates by the NNPC, the concessionaire of the field.\n\nThe bulk of Bonga Southwest\u2019s resources are located in OML 118, but it also extends into OMLs 132 and 140, operated by US major Chevron, where it is called Aparo. Other partners in the project are France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Italy\u2019s Eni\n\nMeanwhile, Shell has joined the ranks of other big oil majors that had recently reported huge profits on higher oil and gas prices, announcing $6.4 billion in net income for the final quarter of 2021.\n\nIn addition, earnings for the full year soared to $19.29 billion, up from $4.8 billion for 2020, Shell said, plus a reduction in net debt by $23 billion to $52.6 billion during the period under review.\n\nBefore now, data from Shell released last month revealed that oil trading slowed down during the fourth quarter of 2021, but gas trading flourished amid the surge in demand and tight supply of the commodity in some parts of the world.\n\nChief executive Ben van Beurden said, \u201c2021 was a momentous year for Shell. We launched our Powering Progress strategy and simplified our share structure and organisation.\n\n\u201cProgress made in 2021 will enable us to be bolder and move faster. We have a compelling strategy, with customers at its core. We have ambitious plans to generate shareholder value, to decarbonise our products and to provide energy to our customers while respecting nature.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Shell said it would buy back another $8.5 billion worth of stocks during the first half of the year and raise dividends yet again, by four per cent for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe former Anglo-Dutch major, which last year dropped its Dutch headquarters to become a fully British-based company, benefited, like its peers, from higher oil prices. This is despite the fact that it shrunk its core operations after a Dutch court ordered it to sharply reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nIn response, Shell sold its assets in the Permian Basin, bringing in $5.5 billion, which it expects to deploy to buy back stock.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday said Africa records about 1.1 million new cases of cancer every year resulting in 700,000 deaths.\n\nIn a message to commemorate this year\u2019s World Cancer Day, the world body said more than 400,000 children were diagnosed annually with cancer around the world, with about 90 per cent living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn the message issued by the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, it urged member states in the continent to make the necessary investment required to ensure that all our citizens, no matter their incomes or geographic location, have access to quality cancer care.\n\n\u201cEvery year, Africa records around 1.1 million new cases of cancer, resulting in up to 700 000 deaths. Breast cancer, along cervical, prostate, liver and colorectal cancers, account for almost half the new cases on the continent annually.\n\n\u201cChildren are also inequitably impacted. Of the more than 400, 000 children diagnosed annually with cancer around the world, about 90 per cent live in low- and middle-income countries. \u201cSurvival rates are at a very low 20 per cent or less in African countries, compared to more than 80 per cent in developed countries,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to Moeti, this year\u2019s theme, \u201cClose the care gap,\u201d marked the start of a three-year campaign to raise global awareness around cancer and its impacts, especially among most vulnerable citizens.\n\n\n\nHe also said that common challenges across the African region included lack of awareness and education, limited access to primary prevention and early detection services, coupled with delays in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\u201cThere is also limited access to palliative care and pain relief.\n\nShortages of specialists in medical and radiation oncology, pathology, medical physics and other essential areas compound the gaps.\n\n\u201cAfrica has only three per cent of the world\u2019s cancer treatment facilities, with radiotherapy available in just 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which contributes to poor survival rates,\u201d he added.\n\nTo \u201cclose the care gap,\u201d WHO Africa is driving a number of key initiatives. These have seen 45 per cent of our countries introduce national HPV vaccination programmes to address the cervical cancer threat. National screening programmes are now operational in 72 per cent countries, 11 of which offer high-performance screening.),\u201d he said. Moeti said renewed efforts to curb new cancer cases were urgent, adding that there are alarming projections that cancer death rates in Africa would rise exponentially over the next 20 years, outstripping the global average by 30 per cent.He also said that common challenges across the African region included lack of awareness and education, limited access to primary prevention and early detection services, coupled with delays in diagnosis and treatment.\u201cThere is also limited access to palliative care and pain relief.Shortages of specialists in medical and radiation oncology, pathology, medical physics and other essential areas compound the gaps.\u201cAfrica has only three per cent of the world\u2019s cancer treatment facilities, with radiotherapy available in just 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which contributes to poor survival rates,\u201d he added.To \u201cclose the care gap,\u201d WHO Africa is driving a number of key initiatives.

Moeti further said that through the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer (GICC), Zambia, Senegal and Ghana have developed country-specific treatment guidelines, established pediatric hospital-based registries, and improved access to chemotherapy.
