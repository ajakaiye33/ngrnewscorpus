          "text": "Dayo Ojerinde, Deborah Tolu-Kolawole and Bakam Armstrong\n\nThe Federal Government on Thursday warned Nigerians to take responsibility for their health as COVID-19 cases continued to rise in the country.\n\nThe Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunmimbe Mamora, who stated this in an interview with one of our correspondents, said, among other measures, there was the need for Nigerians to take responsibility for their actions to tackle coronavirus.\n\nMamora said this as COVID-19 cases continued to increase, with the country recording 5,398 infections between December 6 and 15.\n\nData obtained from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Thursday indicated a sharp increase in infections as only 739 cases were recorded between November 26 and December 5, indicating a 630.45 per cent increase within 10 days.\n\nWhen asked what the Federal Government would do in view of the increase in cases, Mamora stated that the government would continue to strengthen existing measures.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s essential to strengthen the existing measures through advocacy, awareness creation, education and emphasis on the need for people to take responsibility for their health.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had on Thursday reported that no fewer than 107 inbound passengers to Nigeria tested positive for COVID-19 in the last one week.\n\nAccording to the report, between November 25 and December 4, the country recorded 749 cases of COVID-19.\n\nBetween December 5 and December 14, the cases recorded were 4,029 representing 437.92 per cent increase over the previous 10 days.\n\nCommenting on the rising cases, the President, Guild of Medical Directors, Dr Abiodun Kuti, said they might be as a result of people coming into the country from Europe and the United States of America.\n\nKuti, in an interview with one of our correspondents, said, \u201cThe influx of Nigerians coming from Europe and America for the festive period will definitely increase the spread of Omicron variant in the country. These countries have high exposure levels already.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State government has said that it will soon get 350,000 COVID-19 booster doses from the Federal Government.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Rilwan Mohammed, disclosed this on Thursday at the third Annual Research Day and Scientific Conference of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital Bauchi.\n\nThe theme for the 2021 conference is: \u201cAddressing COVID-19 Vaccine hesitancy in developing countries: Latest evidence and future direction.\u201d\n\nMohammed who is also the Chairman, Contact and Surveillance Sub-Committee of the Bauchi State Task Force on COVID-19, said the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency would soon supply the booster doses to the state pointing out that the booster shots would only be administered to those who had taken their first and second jabs of COVID-19 vaccines, to further protect them against the Omicron variant.\n\nHe said,, \u201cEven if you are vaccinated, you can get infected with the mutant Omicron variant of COVID-19, however, the good thing is that people that were vaccinated will not get the severe form of the Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cTo prevent Omicron variant, the only way is to do the booster dose and the federal government will send about 350,000 booster doses next week to Bauchi State.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Chairman described COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy as a major problem because even the most educated people including healthcare workers were yet to take the vaccine.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

The management have abandoned the workers. We are hearing that governor El-rufai wants to buy the factory. We have no problem with that, but if it is true, we are appealing to the governor to pay our entitlements before taking over the Textile. Over 18 years we have been in this pains and struggle to get our benefits, but without success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to remind El-rufai to fulfil his campaign promise of reviving the Textile and pay our gratuities. He told us during his campaign in 2015 that he would make case for the revival of the Textile and pay our entitlements. This is our property until our benefits are paid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here to pray to God and our political leaders to come to our aid and pay our benefits. Over 30,0000 workers laid off from all the Textile industries in Kaduna. We have lost some of our members while they were waiting for their entitlements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Organising Secretary of National Union of Textiles, Garments and Tailoring Workers Union of Nigeria (NUTGTWN), Comrade Adepoju Fatai said, \u201cour gathering here today is not in vain. Since 15 years ago over 4000 workers were laid off from Arewa Textile industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a union the only power we have is to improve on the welfare of the workers, but since the factory closed in 2005, benefits of workers were not paid.\n\n\u201cAnd because of this, we are in court for over 10 years. Court ruled in favour of the workers. But management refused to pay. If court gives judgement, it should be obeyed, but reverse is the case.\n\n\u201cThe court gave judgement for 250 million naira as against 600 million naira being the entire sum of our entitlements.\n\n\u201cWe heard that Kaduna State government wants to take over the company. We are not bothered about the takeover, but pay our benefits. But they cannot sell it without paying our entitlements. Our benefits must be paid. \u201c\n\n\u201cNothing will be done here until our entitlements are paid. If the management likes, let them come and level us with the caterpillar or bulldozers. The management never thought it human and our rights to pay our benefits for the past many years ago,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Gang target virgins in higher schools\n\n\u2022Lure victims with lofty promises\n\n\u2022Lodges in hotels with radio speakers to control noise; sprays perfumes to control smell from victims\u2019 dead bodies, ropes, belts for tying them up\n\nBy Vincent Ujummadu, Awka; Ike Odu, Nsukka & Esther Onyegbulah\n\nA middle- aged man (name withheld) suspected to be the ring-leader of a deadly gang that specializes in raping and using teenagers for rituals has been arrested by the police in Zone 13, Anambra State.\n\nThe suspect said to reside in Obosi, Anambra State but hails from Ovoko, Nsukka in Enugu State was allegedly involved in luring unsuspecting teenagers in higher institutions of learning in the Eastern states of the country to hotels where they will be raped, after which their blood will be collected for ritual. Police sources said the suspect whose means of livelihood are unknown claims to be building hotels and hostels and always invited his victims to hotels with promises of showering them with gifts.\n\nHow his exploits blew open\n\nHowever, his exploits were blown open at the University town of Nsukka, last October, after he started charting a teenage student of the University (name withheld) on facebook and later ended up tricking her to a popular hotel in the town where he allegedly raped her. It was gathered that while he was in the act, the suspect tied the girl with belts and rope and she lost consciousness.\n\nLater, the suspect reportedly revived the teenager and told her to clean up in the bathroom. Luckily, the victim ran into the bathroom with her telephone, locked herself up and was able to send frantic messages to her roommate and other friends including her doctor to mobilize students and save her life.\n\nFather of the victim, who is a senior lecturer at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, who pleaded for the family\u2019s name not to be mentioned, stated that in the SOS message (print out shown to our reporter), her daughter was pleading passionately with her roommate to engage a commercial motorcyclist urgently and race to the hotel to save her life.\n\nAccording to the father of the victim, as she was busy sending the message crying for help, the impatient suspect was already calling on her to come out of the bathroom. \u201cWhen she failed to respond, the suspect who was blaring the radio set in high decibels with a view to covering up his deeds banged furiously on the bathroom door and started destroying it.\n\nRoommates to the rescue\n\n\u201cLuckily, her friends in the campus, who found it very difficult to get a commercial motorcyclist at the hour of the night succeeded at last and rushed to the hotel, with her doctor, who was also alerted. They broke into room 101 and rescued the girl. Both the students and other lodgers in the hotel, including players of the famous Enugu Rangers International, nearly lynched the suspect to death but for the intervention of security guards from the hotel, who assured of handing him over to the police.\n\n\u201cHowever, the story took a different dimension after the police at Nsukka Division arrived the scene, only to be told that the suspect escaped from the grip of the hotel\u2019s security guards. They only succeeded in recovering the suspect\u2019s abandoned vehicle, bloodstained bedsheet in the room where the victim was raped, and CCTV footages in the hotel.\n\nWhen investigations continued, we started suspecting fowl play when overtures were being made to us for the matter to be settled amicably, while police investigators kept treating the matter as a mere rape case, without addressing the glaring issue of attempted murder for ritual.\n\nBased on this, we quickly transferred the case to Zone 13, Ukpor, Anambra State, where fresh investigations commenced.\n\nIntelligence report that paid off.\n\n\u201cThe police at the zone, together with some military men involved in operation in the east, swiftly embarked on intelligence and scientific investigation and succeeded in arresting the suspect, while he had concluded plans to flee to Ivory Coast,\u201d he stated.\n\nIt was learned that while they were tracking the suspect, they nearly succeeded twice at arresting him, while he was also luring another teenage student to a hotel in Nsukka to perform the same act. He narrowly escaped during the encounter. However, police sources said they are still trying unravel the faith of the girls he went out with during that period.\n\nIt was gathered that police search for him paid off few weeks later, after vigilante men at Obosi, Anambra State who were alerted over his atrocities, succeeded in arresting him while he was almost trying to escape to Ivory Coast. The suspect, according to sources, made serious overtures of huge financial rewards to the vigilante group at Obosi to set him free, but the group resisted the temptation and handed him over to the police.\n\nHis operational weapons\n\nVanguard Metro learned that after his arrest, signs of charms, anti-gun and matchete charms were seen all over his body. However, police sources said initially after his arrest, he accused the victim and her roommate of being lesbians but, later, he started narrating his exploits with his gang. It was disclosed that the suspect is a secondary school drop-out and has no known means of livelihood. He reportedly lodges in expensive hotels and drives two cars. He allegedly uses different names like Emeka, Emmy, Oderah Loius, during his criminal exploits and had spent some time in Ghana, where he was said to have escaped after he was exposed.\n\nHe also goes about to hotels with radio speakers to control noise, an odour perfume to control smell from his victim\u2019s dead bodies; ropes, belts for restraining the victims and tying them up. These items were recovered together with the CCTV footages in the hotel. In some of his chats, collected through intelligence report, he was also advertising on his whatsaap status that young girls should contact him to collect their school fees and that he was organising a big burial at Nsukka, that they should come and pick their school fees.\n\nPolice sources further said that he goes about with sack of money, living in hotels, driving SUV\u2019s and wearing expensive Rolex watches and gold bangles, which he uses to entice his victims. He also lives in three addresses in Obosi and Nsukka.\n\nMy daughter has been traumatized\n\nFather of the victim, who said his daughter has been traumatised after the incident, told Metro: \u201cAll we are saying is that police must arrest members of the gang hiding outside and busy pressing buttons for their master to be freed. We have all the evidence to show that it is not just a case of rape, but an attempted ritual murder. All his collaborators helping him to subvert justice must be brought to book.\n\n\u201cWe learned that the hotel management sacked the manager and some staff that witnessed the incident, to cover up for the suspect, despite helping him to escape when he was held by the mob to be handed to the police. They also gave the suspect master key to the room he gave to his gang members, which they used to move out most of the suspect\u2019s belongings.\u201d\n\nReactions\n\nWhen contacted, the General Manager of Jerry Marriott Hotel and Suites in Nsukka Local government area of Enugu State, where the incident allegedly took place, Patrick Agu said he was not yet employed by the hotel management when one Louis Onyeke allegedly raped and attempted to murder the UNN student in the hotel facility. However, Agu said his enquires revealed that the incident happened in the hotel and that police were already investigating the case.\n\nHe also exonerated the hotel management from the escape of the suspect, who has now been arrested by police. \u201cWhen that incident happened, I was not yet an employee of Jerry Marriott Hotel. However, upon my enquires, I learnt that the incident really took place. Already, the police are handling the matter and the suspects are all reporting to Zone 13, Ukpor-Dunukofia, Anambra State, to answer for their crime. That is all I can say about the incident,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile reacting to the development, the spokesperson of Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe, said he needed time to verify the incident. \u201cIs it something that happened three months ago? You have to hold on while I verify the incident, because it is not recent,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his comment, when contacted, the Assistant Inspector- General of Police in-charge of Zone 13, Ukpor-Dunukofia, Muri Musa, told Metro: \u201dThe case of rape against the suspect from Ovoko, Nsukka in Enugu State, who attempted to rape a doctor\u2019s daughter\u2019s is before Zone 13. We are working on it. When we conclude our investigation, if there is any prima facie case against the suspect, he will be arraigned in the court of law. The suspect has been arrested and he is in our custody.\u201d\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

But with the visit of the governor, we have hope that more security personnel would be engaged to help in tackling the situation\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to people of the affected communities, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello decried the killing of worshippers in the Tunga Ba\u2019ari community last week, insisting that the act was unacceptable and condemnable.\n\nHe assured the people that adequate measures are being taken to prevent reoccurrence, adding that the government will not rest on its oars in protecting the lives and properties of the people of the state.\n\nBello, however, noted that the attacks cannot thrive without the help of insiders in the communities, hence the need to ensure that people with questionable characters are fished out to face the wrath of the law.\n\nOn the purpose of his visit, he told the people, \u201cI decided to come and see what has happened, get first-hand information so that we can plan how to stop such things from happening further. It is unfortunate that people are being attacked while saying their prayers early in the morning.\n\n\u201cI understand that it is the work of bandits probably with the connivance of some locals. So I call on the community members to pay attention to their neighbours and to be very observant of what is going on around them\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Council Chairman of Mashegu, Alh. Alhassan Isah Mazakuka, told the governor that a total of 17 people were killed, 19 were kidnapped and nine were injured at Ba\u2019ari while praying in the mosque last week.\n\nMazakuka explained that some of the victims who sustained injuries in the attack are receiving medical attention at the General Hospital Kontagora and others referred to Kebbi State for treatment.\n\nAlso, the Ward Head of Tunga Ba\u2019ari Alh. Garba Aliyu, decried the attack on communities by bandits while calling on the government to empower the vigilantes more due to the increasing state of insecurity that pervades the area.",

So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them.

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge.

What then could he be demanding from me after his two-term governorship to make me pressurise him to build a house for me when I did not get a naira from him before he became the governor?\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of pressure on me not to react to Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s tantrums; he is a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in. I have been urged to keep to the adage not to \u2018Answer a fool lest you reduce yourself to his level\u2019, but there is also an adage that says, \u2018Answer a fool lest he thinks he is wise\u2019. A lot has been said in the press and the social media to demolish tantrums.\n\n\u201cBut I owe a duty to myself and to put the record straight for posterity about the big lie that Bola Tinubu built my house in Lekki for me. I, therefore, deny categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given (to) me by my late leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of the blessed memory.\u201d\n\nAfter a detailed information on how he sold his residence in Surulere and raised funds in sundry places to acquire the property, he declared: \u201cThe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo, and three bedroom flat in a townhouse at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world.\u201d\n\nHe then threw a challenge: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the above facts.\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu. His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\n\n\u201cI hereby challenge Chief Bisi Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing these properties as I have done above.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu, the great philanthropist should also disclose the source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the Southwest and that of General Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos.\n\n\u201cHe should also authorise the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

He said such declaration would allow operatives to work without concerns about rights violations as the bandits were enemies of humanity.\n\n\u201cBandits have no religious, ideological or ethnicity inclinations; they are notorious criminals terrorising law-abiding citizens.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe advised the Federal Government to initiate processes for recruiting locals in the areas affected by banditry to complement efforts of mainstream security personnel to tackle the menace.\n\n\u201cThe recruited persons shall serve as special forces equipped with right skills and modern firearms to confront bandits since the locals know the terrains. After the special mission, the recruited persons could be re-engaged as forest guards to prevent new security challenges.\n\n\u201cIn Sokoto State, we outlawed the self-styled vanguards referred to as \u2018Yansakai\u2019 whose activities of extra-judicious killings led to reprisals and escalation of the situation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor added that legitimate vigilance groups were being trained and teamed with mainstream security operatives to support the latter\u2019s activities.\n\n\u201cAll hands must be on deck to check banditry and to support President Buhari at all levels to contain the situation. This situation calls for specialised approach with holistic support from community groups, religious leaders and other individuals to tackle.\u201d\n\nTambuwal, who urged the citizenry to expose people supporting banditry in any form, especially the informants, thanked the governors forum for the solidarity visit and the donation of N50 million to support affected families.\n\nGovernor Masari, who said the visit was to commiserate with Tambuwal over the unfortunate attacks and the loss of lives stressed also that it was time citizens and communities stood up to protect themselves.\n\n\u201cBandits behave worse than animals in view of the atrocities they perpetrate; people need to protect themselves. The issue of banditry in Northwestern part of the country is not beyond us. We know the problem and the solutions are something that we as a people are capable of doing.This is provided that all of us take responsibility and stop the blame game.\n\n\u201cBanditry, especially our own in the Northwestern part of the country can easily be dealt with if all hands are put on deck. This is because it has no religious coloration, no ethnic coloration, it is not ideological. It is simply pure criminality.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Police had limitations in fighting insecurity, Masari said security agencies required technologies to effectively tackle the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe need to know where the bandits are recruited, at what price are they recruited, all these are issues that are very well known to us. These are issues we should have the capacity to do provided there is determination, there is leadership and there is political will.\n\n\u201cWe have no alternative; we have to conquer our environment in order to survive in it.\n\n\u201cWe in the Northwestern governor\u2019s forum, together with the governors of Plateau, Nasarawa and Niger, are working with the Federal Government to come up with strategies and solutions.\n\nSimilarly, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State said blaming each other would not bring any solution to the security challenge.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a lot in this country. The issue started with cattle rustling that looked so simple and so indigenous. We did not even investigate it to find out what was its root course.\n\n\u201cCattle rustling has graduated to kidnapping, kidnapping graduated to banditry while we are fighting Boko haram on the other side.\n\n\u201cWe have to break that cycle. Our first challenge is how we reclaim our forests without being affected by the bandits,\u201d he said.\n\nProffering solution, Ganduje said data must be sourced while also calling for the use of technology in the fight against insecurity.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

However, it is pertinent to note that, some states are embroiled in crisis with multiple factions.\n\n\u201cThese factions are not new to our politics, especially since the return of democracy in 1999. However, it is important to put into consideration, the consequences of these factions during and after elections.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remind you that the ignoble creation of factions, in our party in Rivers and Zamfara states, cost the party the governorship elections in those states. APC also failed to field candidates in some senatorial districts in Cross River State, thereby helping the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to victory.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the creation of factions denied the party victory in so many states because the crises were never settled. As a peaceful and tactful leader, I am sure, you wouldn\u2019t allow such scenario to reoccur.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that I write to appeal to your office and members of the convention extraordinary planning committee to reconsider the slated date for the 2022 national convention.\n\n\u201cIt is important we collectively save the party from implosion due to the numerous court cases across the states. It is also important you reconsider the date due to the confusions with regards to the zoning of offices.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after the state congresses, the burgeoning morale of party members was badly affected. It would be devastating to continue with the convention without settling the differences in our various states and, sort out the issues of zoning which, in my opinion, cannot be addressed in two months.\n\n\u201cThe logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts is that having too many cases without settling them amicably, the APC may be embarking upon a collision course which may lead the party to implosion.\n\n\u201cIt is important to first postpone the convention with all peace and reconciliation machineries fully put in place. The issue of zoning should be properly handled with even representation across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, I am suggesting for a simultaneous presidential primary and election of NWC members on the same day and venue to avoid rancour and litigations.\n\n\u201cAs a listening and kindhearted leader, I am confident you will consider my humble appeal to postpone the convention.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "Adebanjo Replies Akande, Asks Him, Tinubu to Explain Their Source of Wealth",
          "text": "Lists properties he disposed to build Lekki home\n\nOyinlola: How Akande awarded N800m contract for construction of a govt house after he lost election\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAfenifere Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, yesterday responded to the allegation by a former Governor of Osun State, Bisi Akande that he (Adebanjo) compelled a national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Bola Tinubu to build a house for him in Lekki, Lagos.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, the nonagenarian noted that the imputation by Akande in his recently released book, \u201cMy Participations,\u201d that the former Lagos governor funded the Lekki home was baseless and false.\n\nAlso, in reaction to the new book, a former Governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, said he found it strange that Akande who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, \u201cafter he lost the election, and in advance, paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo stated that he decided to add Tinubu to the fray because his (Tinubu\u2019s) refusal to refute the allegation after the launch of the autobiography meant the APC leader agreed with Akande.\n\nWhile explaining how he financed his own building, Adebanjo urged both Akande and Tinubu to do likewise and tell Nigerians how they became stupendously rich.\n\nSpecifically, he called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to verify his statement as to how he funded the building and called on the former Lagos governor to explain how he allegedly financed the APC campaign in 2015.\n\n\u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the above facts. It is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHis house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the governor of Osun state.\n\n\u201cI hereby challenge Chief Bisi Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing these properties as I have done above.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu, the great philanthropist, should also disclose the source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the south-west and that of Gen. Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos. He should also authorise the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande reiterated that since Tinubu himself was present at the book presentation, he expected him within a few days to refute such a malicious falsehood about him, emanating from his \u201cman Friday.\u201d\n\nHe noted that it was shocking that Tinubu who just some three years ago at n the occasion of the presentation of Adebanjo\u2019s auto-biography, \u201cSaying It As It Is,\u201d attested to the fact that if not for \u201cMy incorruptibility and strength of character he, Bola Tinubu would not have been Governor of Lagos State in 1999.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo wondered what Tinubu could be demanding from him after his two-term governorship to make him pressurise him to build a house for him, when he did not get a naira from Tinubu before he became the governor.\n\nDescribing Akande as a neophyte and a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in, Akande averred that he owed himself a duty to put the record straight for posterity about the \u201cbig lie\u201d that Tinubu built the house for him.\n\n\u201cI therefore deny categorically (sic) that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory,\u201d he argued.\n\nOn the details of the properties he disposed to build the Lekki home, he listed a four-bedroom duplex with two bedroom flat enclosed with two undeveloped plots at plot four, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos state, where he lived hitherto. He added that the house was commissioned in 1972 by Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State.\n\n\u201cIt was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house. I took the federal government to court for damages and I was awarded N1 million which has not been paid till today by the federal government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba (SAN), was my counsel,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he mentioned a two-storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos state, which he bought through an estate agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku, who has since relocated to UK and has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo. He is still alive and he lives in one of the flat in the building,\u201d Adebanjo noted.\n\nHe also mentioned a plot of 45X100 which he said he inherited from his mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by instalment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well-known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent. I then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now,\u201d Adebanjo recalled.\n\nHe added that when the interest on the loan became unbearable, he was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to him by Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island.\n\n\u201cOne Mr. Ade Otusanya, a friend of my son, Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land. The contractor who built my Lekki house is Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates.\n\n\u201cThe Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Tokunbo Oshokoya, Senior Partner of Messrs Oshea Projects. The Architect is Mr. Deji Johnson. The Quantity Surveyor is the late Otunba T.B Adebayo.\n\n\u201cThe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo, and three-bedroom flat in a town house, at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world,\u201d the Yoruba leader said.\n\nFurthermore, Oyinlola who said his forthcoming autobiography had already taken care of all the issues raised in Akande\u2019s book about him, however said he decided to make preliminary replies for the benefit of Nigerians who may be interested in hearing his own immediate side of the story.\n\nThe former Osun Governor stated: \u201cChief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House). I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election was really not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to site and complete the works, more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\n\n\u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s own appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election. I consulted Chief Akande on this.\n\n\u201cHe denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Oyinlola wrote: \u201cAkande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa road in Osogbo which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election, and in advance, paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800million.\n\n\u201cChief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book. This was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a government house after losing his re-election.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government which Akande refused to complete. I completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. \u201cThe state has continued to use the structures till date. Akande, in his book, condemned my decision to opt for that project instead of his own idea. Further details on this are in my forthcoming book.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe World Bank yesterday announced its approval of a $700 million credit from its International Development Association (IDA) for the Nigeria Agro-Climatic Resilience in Semi-Arid Landscapes (ACReSAL) Project.\n\nThe project is expected to increase the implementation of sustainable landscape management practices in northern Nigeria and strengthen the country\u2019s long-term enabling environment for integrated climate-resilient landscape management.\n\nAccording to a statement from the multilateral institution, the productivity of major crops in Nigeria had been steadily declining over the past two decades, in part due to climate change, forcing an expansion of the area under agriculture and increased imports to meet the food needs of Nigeria\u2019s growing population.\n\nIt noted that persistent water shortages, especially in the extreme north, continue to exacerbate land degradation, desertification, and habitat loss.\n\n\u201cResource shortages, violent conflict, outdated agricultural systems not adapted to changing dryland conditions, lack of access to finance, weak value chain linkages, an uncompetitive environment for agribusiness, and poor market access are other key barriers to increased agricultural productivity in Nigeria. \u201cBetter environmental and water resources management and resilience against disaster and climate risks (largely water-related) are needed to sustain economic growth and protect the most vulnerable,\u201d it added.\n\nWorld Bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri noted that Nigeria was faced with water scarcity and droughts which occur every five years, on average, with the potential to increase in frequency due to climate change.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis scenario not only threatens food security, livelihoods, and productivity, but also exacerbates fragility and increases the risk of violence.\n\n\u201cWith communities and households that are most dependent on natural resources for their survival and vulnerable to desertification, this intervention will improve multi-sectoral watershed planning and investments to help about 3.4 million direct beneficiaries adapt to evolving dryland conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based institution pointed out that in recent years, the Government of Nigeria had established several initiatives in the agriculture sector to combat desertification including afforestation and reforestation programs, dissemination of proven agricultural technologies and sustainable agricultural practices, and promotion of efficient energy sources.\n\nHowever, it stated that efforts to stop and reverse desertification had been complicated by the need to feed a rapidly increasing population in a region where natural resources were dwindling and over 90 percent of national food production depends on smallholder farmers who lack the capacity to increase food production without degrading land.\n\nThe ACReSAL Project is a 6-year strategic project prioritising actions within four components: Dryland Management, Community Climate Resilience, Institutional Strengthening and Project Management, and Contingent Emergency Response.\n\nIt is expected to improve the capacity of the country to adapt to a changing climate, largely through enhancing multi-sectoral convergence (across environment, agriculture and water) and technology modernisation, including improved use of data, analytics, and connectivity.\n\n\u201cThe project will specifically target the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalised groups, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, internally displaced people, and ethnic and religious minorities using an integrated watershed approach across sectors and levels of governance,\u201d Task Team Leader, ACReSAL, World Bank, Joy Iganya Agene said.\n\n\u201cThis will help reduce the vulnerability of millions of the extreme poor in northern Nigeria, strengthening their own role in the management of their natural resources while also addressing land degradation, strengthening climate resilience, and lessening livelihood vulnerability in dry, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions in the northern states,\u201d Agene added.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s IDA established in 1960, helps the world\u2019s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people\u2019s lives.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Issues them warning letters\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe National Judicial Council (NJC) has placed a promotion ban on three judges of courts of coordinate jurisdiction, who issued conflicting court orders, particularly as it concerned the recent leadership tussle in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe decision, which formed part of resolutions of the council\u2019s meeting of December 14 and 15, 2021, is believed will serve as a deterrent to other judges.\n\nSpecifically, the affected judges will not get \u201cpromotion to higher Bench for a period ranging from two to five years whenever they are due\u201d.\n\nThe affected judges are Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State; Justice Nusirat I. Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State and Justice Edem Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State.\n\nA statement from the NJC\u2019s Director of Information, Mr Soji Oye, noted that although there was no written petition, allegations of corruption or impropriety against the subject Judges, council nevertheless, initiated investigation pursuant to its inherent disciplinary powers under the constitution to unravel the circumstances that led to the spate of exparte orders granted by these courts of coordinate jurisdiction over matters bearing same parties and subject matter.\n\n\u201cThe meeting, which was chaired by the Deputy Chairman of Council, Justice Mary Peter-Odili, agreed with the recommendations of the Investigation Committee set up in September 2021, that Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever he is due, as he failed to exercise due diligence in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 between IBEALWUCHI EARNEST ALEX & 4 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR, as there was no real urgency, in the circumstances of the matter, that would have required an Exparte Order.\n\n\u201cHis Lordship is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cCouncil also resolved that Justice Nusirat I. Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever due, having found fundamental defects and non-compliance with the law in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: KB/HC/M.71/2021 between YAHAYA USMAN & 2 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR.\n\nHe is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cJustice Edem Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State will not be promoted to higher Bench for five years for allowing himself to be used as a tool for \u2018forum shopping\u2019 and abuse of Court process in Suit No: HC/240/2021 between Mr. ENANG KANUM WANI AND UCHE SECONDUS as it was evident that, in granting the Exparte Order, he was seized of earlier Orders of the High Courts of Rivers and Kebbi States, being Courts of coordinate jurisdiction with his.\n\n\u201cHe is also to receive warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\nThe Council also placed him on its Watch-List for a period of two years,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nIn a related development, the council also approved the appointment of 63 judges for 16 states, nine of which are heads of court.\n\nEighty-four members of staff, ranging from salary Grade levels 7 to 17, were approved for promotion as submitted by its Appointment, Promotion and Disciplinary Committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says building financed with bank loan, sale of personal property\n\nChallenges Akande to declare sources of financing own property\n\nAsks Tinubu to state where he got funds to bankroll Buhari, South west APC elections\n\nAfenifere Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has debunked claims made by former Osun State Govcernor and All Progressives Congress pioneer Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, that former Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu built his Lekki house for him.\n\nAkande had in his book titled \u2018My Participation\u2019 launched last Thursday, claimed that Adebanjo brought pressure on Tinubu to build the Lekki home for him.\n\n\u201cI therefore deny categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of 3 developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory,\u201d Adebanjo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe Afenifere leader said since Tinubu himself was present at the book presentation, he had expected him to, within a few days, refute \u201csuch a malicious falsehood about me emanating from his Man Friday.\u201d\n\nHe premised his expectation on the fact that \u201cTinubu (had said) just some 3 years ago on the occasion of the presentation of my auto-biography \u2018SAYING IT AS IT IS\u2019 that for my incorruptibility and strength of character he Bola Tinubu would not have been Governor of Lagos State in 1999.\u201d\n\nGoing down memory lane, Adebanjo gave details of how he financed the Lekki house. Adebanjo\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cThe details are as follows:\n\n\u201cA 4 bedroom duplex with 2 bedroom flat enclosed with 2 undeveloped plots at plot 4, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos State, this is where I was living before moving to Lekki*.\n\n\u201cThe house was commissioned in 1972 by Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when General Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State.\n\n\u201cIt was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house, I took the Federal Government to court for damages and I was awarded #1million naira which has not been paid till today by the Federal Government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, was my counsel.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to St Baths Anglican Church, Aguda, Surulere.\n\nTwo storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI bought it through an Estate Agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku who has relocated to UK, he has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo.\n\n\u201cHe is still alive and he lives in one of the flats in the building. Four storey building with a warehouse on the ground floor and six flats on top. It was commissioned by Chief Awolowo in 1977.\n\n\u201cI inherited the plot of 45\u2019X100\u2019 from my mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it*.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by installment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent.\n\n\u201cI then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now*.\n\n\u201cWhen the interest on the loan became unbearable, I was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to me by Chief Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island. One Mr. Ade Otusanya a friend of my son Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land.\n\n\u201cThe contractor who built my Lekki house is Engr. Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates.\n\n\u201cThe Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Engr. Tokunbo Oshokoya, Senior Partner of Messrs Oshea Projects.\n\n\u201cThe Architect is Mr. Deji Johnson\n\nThe Quantity Surveyor is the late Otunba T.B Adebayo.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo said \u201cthe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo, and 3 Bedroom flat in a town house, at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world.\u201d\n\nHe therefore authorized the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to verify the facts he provided.\n\nChallenging Chief Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing his own properties as he had done, Adebanjo claimed: \u201cIt is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu. His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\u201d\n\nHe also challenged Tinubu to disclose \u201cthe source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the Southwest and that of General Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos.\u201d\n\nHe dared the former Lagos governor \u201cto authorize the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Throughout 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) implemented various reforms and policies to ensure economic and financial stability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it received kudos for some of its policies, the apex bank also received knocks from Nigerians.\n\nTheCable looks at five major policies of the CBN that had impacts on Nigerians in the year 2021.\n\nNAIRA 4 DOLLAR SCHEME\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, the apex bank introduced the \u2018Naira 4 Dollar Scheme\u2019 as an incentive to boost inflows of diaspora remittances into the country.\n\nWith the initiative, all recipients of diaspora remittances through CBN\u2019s licensed international money transfer operators (IMTOs) are paid N5 for every $1 received as remittance inflow.\n\nThe scheme was applauded by many market analysts as a great approach to drive foreign exchange inflow into the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBAN OF FOREX SALE TO BDCs\n\nIn July 2021, the CBN banned the sale of foreign exchange (forex) to Bureaux De Change (BDC) operators. It also stopped the issuance of new licenses to BDCs.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, CBN governor, accused BDC operators of turning away from their objectives \u2014 to process FX demands of $5,000 or less \u2014 to becoming a conduit for illegal financial flows working with corrupt people to conduct money laundering in Nigeria.\n\nSince then, the apex bank had been channelling FX to commercial banks to meet customers\u2019 legitimate demands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA day after the move, the naira suffered an abysmal fall from 505 to 525 per dollar at the parallel market, better known as the black market.\n\nEmefiele has consistently argued that it is not a true reflection of Nigeria\u2019s exchange rate.\n\nToday, the naira is trading at a record-high between N565 and 570 at the black market.\n\nCLAMPDOWN ON FINTECH COMPANIES OVER \u201cILLEGAL\u201d FOREX, CRYPTO TRADING\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February 2021, the CBN directed deposit money banks (DMBs), non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), and other financial institutions (OFIs) to identify persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions within their systems and ensure that such accounts are closed immediately.\n\nIt also directed banks from transacting in and with entities dealing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies were being used to facilitate scams, money laundering, terrorism financing, illicit fund flows, and other criminal activities.\n\nThe directive sparked controversies among experts, operators, and speculators alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany were concerned about the potential negative effect it could have on the country\u2019s growing cryptocurrency market and innovation in financial technology (fintech).\n\nIn August 2021, a federal high court in Abuja granted the request of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze accounts belonging to some technology trading platforms offering local and foreign stocks.\n\nThe apex bank said it was investigating \u201cillegal foreign exchange trading\u201d by the fintech companies and sought the court injunction to freeze their accounts for 180 days pending the completion of investigations.\n\nThe companies include Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited OPNS, Chaka Technologies Limited, CTL/Business Expenses, and Trove Technologies Limited.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited, and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\n\nAssuring customers that their funds were safe, the companies affirmed their willingness to work with the apex bank to address the concerns of illegitimacy.\n\nSome analysts believe that the apex bank\u2019s freezing order spells doom for Nigeria\u2019s ease of doing business reputation and hampers the growth of fintech startups in the country.\n\nThe court also ruled CBN can not use a mere circular as law.\n\neNAIRA, NIGERIA\u2019S FIRST DIGITAL CURRENCY\n\nIn October, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) rolled out eNaira, the country\u2019s first digital currency. eNaira serves as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, offering better payment prospects in retail transactions when compared to cash payments. The apex bank partnered with Bitt Inc., a Barbados-based company, to launch the digital currency operations. CBN said the digital currency gained acceptability among Nigerians, including those in the diaspora, with over 600,000 downloads in a month. Emefiele had noted that eNaira would provide cheap, efficient, and faster means of conducting payments for most Nigerians.\n\n100 FOR 100 POLICY\n\nOn October 25, 2021, the CBN announced the introduction of its new financial instrument tagged, \u2018The 100 for 100 PPP \u2014 Policy on Production and Productivity\u2019\n\nThe 100 for 100 PPP is a scheme designed to financially support 100 targeted private sector companies every 100 days, beginning from November 1. Companies can apply for as much as N5 billion under this scheme. Any amount above N5 billion would require special approval from CBN\u2019s management.\n\nHowever, the selection criteria for the scheme limits the instrument to only new projects and would not cover any refinance of existing facilities.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the initiative is a long-term loan for the acquisition of plant and machinery, as well as working capital.",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined.

          "text": "The Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) is a step closer to getting enacted into law as it has now been approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC). The approval was made on December 15, and now, the Presidency will submit the bill to the National Assembly for consideration.\n\nThe NSB aims to create an enabling environment for Nigerian startups to thrive.The three major challenges that the bill is looking to tackle are the lack of an enabling environment, unclear regulatory framework, and inadequate local content support. The bill proposes measures to ensure that these issues are addressed. For example, there will be protection and incentives, like tax breaks and access to an exclusive list of public and private-led funding opportunities, for local entrepreneurs. There will also be incentives to attract local and foreign investors to the Nigerian startup community.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has the highest number of startups on the continent\u2014about 750\u2014and holds the total highest YoY raises, it ranks below countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Tunisia in terms of business friendliness. With bans on cryptocurrency trading, and clampdowns on online investment, trading, and even social media, Nigeria\u2019s startup scene has been rocked by a few disruptive regulatory announcements in recent years.\n\nThe bill is the result of a collaborative effort between the Presidency, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, the Nigerian Export and Promotion Council and wider government bodies. The initiative for the NSB was launched in May of this year by the Presidency, in collaboration with 30 tech leaders, including Ventures Platform founder Kola Aina and Future Africa founder Iyin Aboyeji, officials of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Minister of Digital Economy Isa Pantami. Since then, it has garnered almost 300 volunteers, with private sector players participating, including legal firms like TLP Advisory and Aelex, policy advisors Advocacy for Policy and Innovation (API) and Innovation for Policy Foundation, and media organisations TechCabal and Wimbart. Google Nigeria and the UK overnment, through the West Africa Research and Innovation Hub and the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub, are also backing the bill.\n\nSpeaking on recent developments, Oswald Osaretin Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Digital Transformation and the NSB Lead said, \u201cThe NSB is one among a series of key activities the Presidency is using to drive the building of a more sustainable ecosystem for young people in Nigeria to thrive and scale.\u201d\n\nKola Aina, Founder and General Partner of Ventures Platform Fund, also added, \u201cThe bill is being proposed to provide an enabling environment for the growth of startups and guard against different challenges faced by startups such as seemingly disruptive regulations, lack of regulatory certainty, and weak infrastructure like broadband, open data, and digital platforms that limit the optimisation of the many benefits of the digital economy.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The increasing scrutiny by investors and multilateral organisations on a company\u2019s environmental, social and governance risks before making investment decisions could reshape the global investment landscape, leaving behind companies that refuse to change, analysis shows.\n\nCurrent trends suggest that a company\u2019s environmental, social and governance (ESG) record as well as sustainability initiatives will play a critical role in whether it gets investments, secures government approvals and licences or even engages in international business.\n\nIn corporate speak, ESG is a term that denotes a stakeholder-centric approach to doing business. Under the environment, a company commits that its operations would not harm the environment, would be socially responsible, for example, in the use of customer\u2019s data and uphold corporate governance principles including ensuring gender equality.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s biggest financiers and lenders say ESG now plays a critical role in their decision to spend investment dollars with many singling out environmentally conscious companies as deserving of their investment.\n\n\u201cESG principles inform the way we run our firm, approach investing and partner with the assets in our portfolio,\u201d said the world\u2019s largest private equity firm, Blackstone, in its 2021 ESG report.\n\nThese private equity firms that largely source capital from institutional investors, such as pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds are increasingly being pressured to fund environmentally responsible companies.\n\nEven pan-African multilateral development organisation, the African Finance Corporation, has also said it \u201censures that it carries out its lending, investment and advisory services to its clients and counterparties in a manner that is not negatively impactful on the environment and which ensures sustainable development.\u201d\n\nA recent survey by a leading professional services firm, PwC Nigeria, found that investors are paying keener attention to ESG risks and opportunities facing companies they invest in and are ready to take action.\n\nThe survey sought the views of 325 investment professionals from 43 territories. 53 percent were asset managers and 34 percent were analysts, and they had a combined $11.6 trillion assets under management.\n\nNearly 80 percent of the respondents said ESG was an important factor in their investment decision making; almost 70 percent thought ESG factors should figure into executive compensation targets, and about 50 percent expressed willingness to divest from companies that did not take sufficient action on ESG issues.\n\nThe results suggest that investors are torn between what they view as a responsibility to the planet and society and their fiduciary responsibilities to their clients.\n\nWhile three-quarters of the investors surveyed said they thought it was worth sacrificing short-term profitability to address ESG issues, about the same number said they would be willing to accept only 1 percentage point or less of a haircut on their investment returns.\n\nHowever, the reality is that pressure to factor climate and environmental concerns into investment decisions is building globally and could become a norm.\n\nAlready, several financiers have indicated their unwillingness to lend to oil and gas projects around the world. At the COP26 in Glasgow, 34 countries and four international finance institutions committed to ending financing for \u201cunabated\u201d fossil fuel projects in overseas countries by the end of 2022.\n\nCampaigners are urging multilateral development banks including the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and others to stop funding fossil fuel projects.\n\nRead also: ESG: Nigeria fails on the environmental, social and governance fronts\n\nThese campaigns are having some impact. Norway\u2019s $1.4 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund says it has exited hundreds of companies in the past few years because they were not compliant with ESG targets.\n\nThe European Union has proposed a rash of new laws to wean its economy off fossil fuels and could impose further tariffs that will impact businesses around the world including Africa.\n\nOne contentious proposal is the introduction of a border carbon adjustment tax that would impose tariffs on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with products imported from outside the European Union. In effect, this would protect European companies from goods made in countries with less stringent climate policies.\n\nSome of the insights deduced from the PwC survey are that companies are better served if they embed ESG directly into their corporate strategy and investors are emphasising the importance of leadership from the top team, starting with the CEO to communicate clearly the ESG goals.\n\nHowever, companies need not go overboard proving they are compliant by inundating \u201cinvestors with reams of data just for the sake of more disclosure or to overreach and fall prey to \u201cgreen-washing\u201d critiques,\u201d noted the PwC analysts.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 cases on Wednesday hit a nine-month high as 1,424 new cases were confirmed. Lagos, the epicentre of the country\u2019s coronavirus infection accounts for 55.8 percent of that total, with 796 cases.\n\nThis surge follows the detection of highly transmissible omicron in the country and a gradual rise in inbound travel.\n\nAnd Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general, World Health Organisation (WHO), has said that the omicron variant should not be underestimated and is spreading faster than any other COVID-19 variants as it is now present in 77 nations.\n\nAccording to data released by the National Centre for Disease Control, 152 cases were detected in Delta, FCT 130, Edo 129, Oyo 82, Ondo 39, Rivers 39, Kaduna 15, Enugu 9, Anambra 8, Kwara 7, Ogun 7, Bayelsa 4, Kano 4, and Akwa Ibom 3.\n\nOmicron has 10 times more mutations on the spike protein than the Delta variant, according to scientific studies, raising fears about transmissibility, symptoms, and whether it can evade vaccines more easily.\n\nScientists say the combination of four particular mutations helps Omicron evade antibodies.\n\nFindings show that Omicron has pushed Nigeria\u2019s average daily cases of up by 451 percent, from 74 cases seen in the first week of December.\n\nA total of 2,859 cases were confirmed in the week ended December 12, compared with 520 in the preceding week. Nigeria now has 217,481 cases confirmed and 2,981 deaths recorded across the federation.\n\nNigeria recorded its first three cases of omicron on December 1, days after it was first discovered in South Africa, and has entered a travel ban tussle with some countries.\n\nThe rise, 75 percent led by Lagos, has activated the reality of the fourth wave of the disease in Nigeria, reliving a similar pattern of surge that played out this time last year.\n\nIn December 2020, Nigeria was pushed into the second wave of the pandemic by a sustained rise in community infections, claiming 1,197 lives.\n\nRead also: COVID-19\u2019s threat to agriculture: A touching story of rural peasant farmers\n\nA new variant of COVID-19, lineage B.1.1.7 (Alpha), which cancelled Christmas in the UK, was found in Nigeria but after initial discovery in the UK.\n\nAbout 5,618 new cases had been recorded by the middle of the month, raising the total number of infections since the start of the pandemic to 73,175 as of December 13.\n\nA fresh record of the highest daily cases was set December 13 with 796 infections, overtaking 790 cases set July 1, during the gradual easing of the two-month-long lockdown that affected Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states.\n\nWhile intensified testing and surveillance at major points of entry reflect in the current infection rate, the WHO says the variant reported in more than 60 nations poses a very high global risk, with mutations likely leading to higher transmissibility.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate Omicron \u2013 WHO\n\nAccording to Ghebreyesus, \u201cOmicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant. We\u2019re concerned that people are dismissing Omicron as mild,\u201d at a COVID update in Geneva.\n\n\u201cSurely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril.\n\n\u201cEven if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems. I need to be very clear: vaccines alone will not get any country out of this crisis. Countries can \u2013 and must \u2013 prevent the spread of Omicron with measures that work today,\u201d the WHO chief said.\n\nHe warned that making choices about strategies to halt the pandemic was the wrong approach: \u201cIt\u2019s not vaccines instead of distancing. It\u2019s not vaccines instead of ventilation or hand hygiene. Do it all. Do it consistently. Do it well.\u201d\n\nIn the past 10 weeks, the international vaccine rollout initiative, COVAX, has shipped more vaccines than in the first nine months of the year combined, with most nations using vaccines as fast as they get them.\n\n\u201cA small group of countries are facing challenges rolling out vaccines and scaling up rapidly, and WHO and our partners are working closely with those countries to overcome bottlenecks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we expect further improvements in supply, there are no guarantees, and the hard-won gains we have made are fragile.\u201d\n\nOmicron existed since 2020 in quest for variant origin \u2013 Scientists\n\nScientists seeking convincing knowledge on how Omicron managed to quietly evolve and sustain mutation have come up with varying theories on how the highly infectious variant might have originated.\n\nOne of them, Sarah Otto, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of British Columbia, said the variant might have hidden under the radar for over a year because Omicron\u2019s genetic traits bear more similarity to forms of the virus that circulated in 2020 than more recent strains, such as Beta and Delta.\n\nThe disease detectives went to work after reports of the discovery of Omicron sprang up from South Africa towards November end and the genetic sequencing details were uploaded to a global database.\n\nA common theory among virologists is that Omicron spent months mutating in an individual with a weakened immune system and a chronic infection, according to a Financial Times report.\n\nOther theories accuse the use of anti-COVID drugs of speeding up evolution and that there is the possibility that a crossover into an animal species that later jumped back into humans occurred.\n\nGiven that South Africa has faced the first wave of Omicron infections, it is likely that the variant traces its roots to somewhere in the region, said Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban.\n\nA South African research team, which included Lessells, discovered an untreated HIV patient late last year who was infected with COVID-19 for more than six months and gave rise to a string of mutations that affected the spike protein, the part of the virus where most of Omicron\u2019s adaptations are located.\n\nA UK study observed a similar process in a COVID patient with blood cancer. The immune response of an untreated HIV patient would be \u201ctoo weak to clear the virus but strong enough to drive the process of evolution,\u201d explained Lessells.",

          "text": "Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest crude oil exporter, is hoping to post its first budget surplus in nearly a decade next year on the back of improved oil prices and restricted government spending, a reality that is everything Nigeria wished for.\n\nUnlike Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer struggling to fund its yearly budget, or even fund an opaque subsidy scheme, Saudi Arabia has declared it will achieve a budget surplus of $24 billion, or about 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product, in 2022, its first since 2014.\n\nThe improvement in financial fortunes is expected to give Saudi the financial muscle it needs to not only scale up its oil production capacity by 1 million bpd to 13 million barrels per day, but also invest heavily in mitigating its carbon emissions, according to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\u201cSurpluses will be used to increase government reserves to counter the needs posted by the coronavirus pandemic, strengthen the kingdom\u2019s financial position, and boost its capabilities to face global shocks and crises,\u201d Salman told Saudi\u2019s official press agency, SPA.\n\nData from the Saudi Arabia budget office show the country\u2019s economy is expected to grow by almost 7.4 percent next year, after expanding by a modest 2.9 percent in 2021.\n\nThe budget document noted that Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic growth would be driven by high oil prices and \u201cthe expected improvement in non-oil GDP assuming that the economy continues to recover gradually from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nRead also: Saudi, Malaysia oil savings relieve citizens in lesson for Nigeria\n\nProject watchers say Saudi Aramco\u2019s multi-billion Zuluf offshore incremental project is expected soon to see the light of day, with the Saudi state-owned firm expected to place awards within months for the project.\n\nThe much-delayed Zuluf development is expected to cost up to $8 billion and aims to boost the country\u2019s crude output by as much as 600,000 barrels per day, almost doubling the field\u2019s production capacity.\n\n\u201cWe see more flexibility on the project spending front and Zuluf is expected to be at the forefront of Aramco\u2019s growth ambitions,\u201d one person close to the Saudi long-term agreement (LTA) arrangement with offshore contractors told SPA.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal projections next year are a marked improvement from recent years that have seen the country post heavy budget deficits as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted global economies and hammered oil prices.\n\nNigeria\u2019s story is the exact opposite of Saudi\u2019s successful economic reform.\n\nThe Federal Government spent N6.17 trillion more than it earned in 2020, leaving its fiscal deficit at 4 percent of GDP, the highest in 21 years, according to Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) data analysed.\n\nFurther analysis shows although, in the first seven months of 2021, revenue rose to N2.45 trillion from N2.17 trillion in the corresponding period last year, expenditure rose faster, climbing 16 percent to N6.43 trillion from N5.53 trillion within the same period.\n\nThe above resulted in a deficit of N5.1 trillion in seven months of 2021, representing 51 percent, increase compared with the N3.36 trillion recorded in the corresponding period last year.\n\n\u201cIf we do not meet our revenue target, which looks too ambitious, the deficit financing for 2021 will likely be higher,\u201d Toki Mabogunje, president, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said.\n\nNigeria needs to think in terms of decentralisation to move forward, Joe Nwakwue, chairman, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), said, noting, \u201cThe government must focus on setting up the right regulations and allow private sector to drive the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nMost experts have long urged for reforms that could unleash faster growth often feeling they are being held back by an out-of-touch Federal Government in Abuja.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate has more than quadrupled over the last six years as the economy went through two recessions, overshadowing efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to create jobs.\n\nThe widening fiscal deficit and other challenges to revenue in Nigeria are unlikely to scuttle the government\u2019s plans to tap between $3 billion and $6 billion from the international debt market this year, according to Samir Gadio, head of Africa strategy at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe last time Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit exceeded 4 percent was in 1999, when the government opened the taps on infrastructure spending to give the economy a boost after years of military rule.",

importantly, the right quality of manpower in all relevant competencies.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have continued to train personnel of all specialties both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, officers, airmen and airwomen of the service are undergoing training in various countries including the U.S., South Africa, India, Belgium, Egypt and Pakistan, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, hundreds of personnel across all specialties are being trained locally in spite of budgetary constraints.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pilot training, 11 student pilots are currently undergoing training in South Africa, while three are undergoing Alpha Jet conversion in Egypt.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, 12 student pilots are undergoing Super Tucano training and four student pilots are undergoing helicopter training in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndeed, two of these student helicopter pilots have completed their training and are expected to graduate very soon.\u201d\n\nThe CAS added that, within the country, 12 student pilots are undergoing Basic Fighter Training while two have recently completed jet conversion at 403 Flying Training School, Kano.\n\nHe added that 12 student pilots were undergoing Basic Transport Training, 32 undergoing Ab-Initio Flying Training and eight undergoing Instructor Training at 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 22 trainees are undergoing UAV Initial and Basic Training at 401 FTS, while 16 student pilots are undergoing Helicopter Pilot Training at the International Helicopter Flying School Enugu.\u201c\n\nAmao explained that all these efforts were targeted at ensuring combat readiness at significantly higher levels to counter both domestic and foreign threats to the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of this, we also recently reviewed the curricula for the various schools in the NAF Institute of Technology to meet expected standards, while also conducting instructional training for the instructors to ensure enhanced performance.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the training curriculum for NAF cadets in the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has been reviewed and new criteria specified for NAF officers that can be eligible for posting to the Academy as instructors.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I authorised the audit of selected ground and flying institutions in NAF by a team of experienced retired senior officers with a view to upgrading the practices and facilities at the institutions to meet international standards.\u201c\n\nAmao noted that the ongoing efforts would go a long way in positioning the institutions as centres of excellence in producing pilots, engineers, technicians and other specialists.\n\nThis, he said, would avail the personnel the opportunity to be well equipped to carry out their constitutional roles more effectively and efficiently in the defence of the territorial integrity of the country.\n\n\u201cSpecial arrangements are also currently being made to upgrade UAV training facilities to enhance the operational capacity of UAV operators in anticipation of increased tempo of air operations with the recently acquired UAVs.\n\n\u201cWhile sustaining capacity building programmes for the NAF Regiment in joint efforts for synergy of air-ground integrated operations with sister services.\u201c\n\nThe CAS congratulated the young pilots and UAVs operators for successfully completing their various courses.\n\n\u201cYou have put in the necessary hard work to get to this stage and your efforts have been recognised with the pinning of wings on your uniforms.\n\n\u201cYou have therefore, left the stage of student aviators and have become pilots and UAV operators responsible for utilisation of national resources in our counter-insurgency and other security efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that you apply and build on your current experiences during your pre-deployment tactical training.\n\n\u201cLike I advised the last set of pilots and UAV operators, you must be relentless in the pursuit of excellence and professionalism as operational pilots and operators, while working with your colleagues across other specialties in the service.\n\n\u201cYou must also strive to imbibe the doctrine of jointness at the frontlines as you interact with personnel from our sister services and other security agencies in pursuit of national securities imperatives.\u201c\n\nAmao thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the enabling environment for NAF and the entire Armed Forces to function more effectively.\n\nEarlier, the Chief of Training and Operations, AVM James Gwani, noted that the winging was the 5th under the administration of Amao.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the young pilots would boost NAF\u2019s operational manpower, especially as the service was inducting and expecting more platforms to address the various security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cI most sincerely express profound gratitude and appreciation to CAS, whose leadership has created the enabling environment for timely turn out of pilots and UAV operators in the NAF.\n\n\u201cTo the pilots and UAV operators, tomorrow brings a new journey, but today marks the end of a chapter in your career as you have become qualified pilots and UAV operators.\u201d\n\n...",

The stakes are too high; we cannot allow Nigeria to continue the way it is going.\n\n\u201cOur great party must come to the rescue and take over the reins of power in this country. What we see ahead is not pleasant at all. I just pray that God Almighty sees us through next year, financially, so that we can even have presidential elections.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t just see how we can continue to be deceiving ourselves. We try to prevent the country from growing by limiting and restricting imports, coming with all forms of phantom excuses to limit people from buying and importing what they cannot produce and need to live.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, they are restricting foreign exchange availability; they are just throwing millions of Nigerians into poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy commitment today is to our great party, the PDP. I accept the responsibility of leading our e-registration process. We have done a very successful pilot in Edo, which I am hoping that the new committee will adopt so that we can roll out and build membership across the country. The soul of our democracy is making sure that we build our party like institutions,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nAddressing members of the delegation, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe decision is of the majority of our people, which is the way we will go. Atiku Abubakar is a Nigerian that is committed to this country; his achievements are visible. So, he is eminently qualified to contest the position of President of Nigeria and as you know, at the end of the day, power ultimately comes from God.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dokpesi commended the governor for his giant strides and transformational projects embarked upon by his administration since he assumed office.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe way and manner that people are suffering across the country is not acceptable. We have never been so divided as a nation; everybody now refers to us as the poverty capital of the world. All the indices clearly show that we are a failed state.\n\n\u201cEven in Abuja, we are afraid of the possibility of invasion by Boko Haram, bandits, and unknown gunmen. The APC-led federal government, without mincing words, has failed totally in fulfilling the promises they made in 2015.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke is a Nigerian politician. He was a senator that represented the Osun-west district between 2017 and 2019. He is from the Adeleke family of Ede in Osun State.\n\nAdeleke commenced his primary education at Methodist Primary School, Surulere Lagos State then relocated to Old Oyo State and attended Nawarudeen Primary School, Ikire. He progressed to The Seventh Day Adventist Secondary School, Ede also in the then Old Oyo State and later moved to Ede Muslim Grammar School Ede, where he finished his secondary school education before relocating to the United States. As he left Nigeria to continue his studies joining his two other elder brothers in the United States of America.\n\nHe started higher studies at Jacksonville State University, Alabama in the United States where he majored in criminal justice and with minor in political science. After much controversies surrounding his educational qualification, he went back to school and got enrolled at Atlanta Metropolitan State College in the United States, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in criminal justice in 2021.\n\nPrivate sector\n\nAdeleke is a businessman and administrator; he was the group executive director at his brother\u2019s company, Pacific Holdings Limited from 2001 to 2016. Prior to joining Pacific Holdings Limited, Ademola had worked with Quicksilver Courier Company in Atlanta, Georgia, US, as a service contractor in 1985\u20131989. He progressed to Origin International LLC, Atlanta, Georgia, US, a flavours and fragrance manufacturing company as vice president from 1990 to 1994.\n\nPolitics\n\nAdeleke is a community member and philanthropist. Adeleke started his political career in 2001 alongside his late brother Senator Isiaka Adeleke who died in April 2017. He contested at the Osun west 2017 by-election after the death of his brother, emerging as the winner under the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nOn 23 July 2018, Adeleke emerged as the governorship candidate of PDP in Osun State after defeating Akin Ogunbiyi by seven votes.\n\nAdeleke was accused and charged to the Osogbo high court for forging his secondary school testimonial and WAEC result to cancel his governorship candidacy. The testimonial Adeleke submitted to INEC dated 20 July 1988, as its Heading Ede Muslim Grammar School, Osun State, as at that year Osun state was not in existence. Also the SSCE results indicated in the testimonial shows that the mode of examination wasn\u2019t existing in the year 1981. Another testimonial with the Heading Ede Muslim High school dated 2018, indicates that the principal which signed the 1988 testimonial also signed the 2018 testimonial, this led to the arrest of the principal. Adeleke\u2019s lawyer in his defense claims his secondary school hasn\u2019t come out to deny his testimonial asking the court to dismiss the Case. The court dismissed the suit stating that the plaintiff could not prove Adeleke\u2019s forgery. Witnesses told court that they didn\u2019t see Adeleke in the examination hall. One of the witnesses said he would have recognised him since he is a public figure.\n\nAdeleke ran for Osun state governorship election under the PDP against top contenders Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola of APC and Iyiola Omisore of SDP on 22 September 2018. The election was declared inconclusive by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) and a rerun slated on 27 September 2018. The candidate of the APC Oyetola was declared winner after the run-off. Adeleke protested the result describing the election as a \u201ccoup\u201d.\n\nOn 22 March 2019 the tribunal sitting in Abuja declared Adeleke the winner of the election.\n\nThe Supreme Court later affirmed Gboyega Oyetola as the authentic winner of the 2018 Osun State governorship election on Friday, July 5, 2019.\n\nAdemola Adeleke is father to two Nigerian musicians. He was nicknamed \u201cDancing senator\u201d because of his dancing skills.",

          "text": "The United Kingdom (UK) government yesterday removed Nigeria and 10 other African countries from the controversial red list under which it banned flights from African countries, following the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in South Africa.\n\nThis is even as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has conceded seven slots to Air Peace to end the diplomatic row with Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the British High Commission in Abuja this decision followed the review of the latest risk assessment from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), stressing that Nigeria and the other 10 countries and territories on the red list will be removed from 4am Wednesday 15 December.\n\nThe statement said that \u201call passengers arriving from Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe will not have to stay in a managed quarantine hotel on arrival in England from this date.\n\nThe UK said further that while all countries have now been removed from the red list, the managed quarantine hotel policy remains in place to act as a crucial line of defence against the importation of variants of concern.\n\nLEADERSHIP had earlier reported that the red list was to be rescinded just two weeks after it was introduced, following intense pressures from Nigerian travelers and the Nigerian government, which threatened retaliation.\n\nThe UK government added Nigeria to the travel red list from Monday December 6, noting that people traveling to the UK from any country will need to take a pre-departure test from December\n\nThe red list was greeted with severe protests from officials in Nigeria and other affected African countries, as travelers in quarantine complained of six-hour journeys to hotels and \u201cgrim\u201d food.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe red list forced thousands into hotel quarantine at a cost of \u00a32,285 per person for 10 days.\n\nBowing to pressure, the British government noted in a statement: \u201cAll vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK must continue to take a pre-departure test two days or less before they depart for the UK and must take a PCR test on or before day 2 and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\n\n\u201cThese testing measures are vital in helping to prevent any additional cases of Omicron from entering the UK and stopping people from passing it on to others.\u201d\n\nIt said that as Omicron cases rise in the UK and in countries around the world, the travel red list is less effective in slowing the incursion of the variant from abroad and these temporary measures are no longer proportionate.\n\nIt noted that the red list has successfully served its purpose in delaying the spread of Omicron into the UK to buy time for scientists to learn more about this variant.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical phase in tackling the Omicron and the Government\u2019s focus remains on slowing the spread of the variant in the UK \u2013 through maintaining testing requirements at the border, through the introduction of Plan B measures, and by turbocharging the booster rollout.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday 14th December, UK Ministers made the decision \u2013 based on scientific and public health data \u2013 to remove Nigeria from the UK\u2019s travel red list. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility.\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had,\u201d the statement added.\n\nUK Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, also said, \u201cThe red list bought our scientists time to learn more about Omicron and to slow the seeding of the variant from abroad into the UK. Now that there are high levels of community transmission, it is right to remove the red list and focus on our national effort to tackle Omicron.\n\n\u201cWith cases doubling every two to three days we\u2019ve turbocharged our booster programme, we\u2019re asking arrivals to keep testing to limit the spread of new cases, and we are introducing Plan B measures to protect the country from the threat of this new variant.\u201d\n\nJavid however warned that \u201crestrictions will be re-imposed should there be a need to do so to protect public health\u201d.\n\nHe said also that airlines will continue to check all passengers for pre-departure tests alongside their completed Passenger Locator Form, even as passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\n\u201cThe government will take further action if necessary to contain the virus and the new variant, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. The UKHSA continues to monitor the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world, and the government is working collaboratively with the World Health Organisation and countries around the world to better understand the new variant,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has conceded seven slots to Air Peace to end the diplomatic row with Nigeria.\n\nThis was after the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) withdrew the ministerial approval granted Emirates Airlines by the Ministry of Aviation over reduction of Air Peace slot to Sharjah Airport.\n\nIt was also gathered that the UAE\u2019s Authority granted the Nigerian carrier the permit to fly directly to Dubai instead of Sharjah Airport, it was learnt.\n\nThe General Civil Aviation Authority, it was learnt, sent a December 13, 2021 letter to Air Peace, though the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not copied in breach of protocol.\n\nThe federal government was however said to have received the letter.\n\nIn a letter obtained by LEADERSHIP yesterday with reference number DCAA/ASA/N-3/014 and addressed to the chairman, Air Peace, Allen Onyema, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA), the authority said slots have been provided for Air Peace at Dubai Airport.\n\nThe letter signed by the director general of DCAA, Mohammed Ahii, said relationship between the two countries have gone a long way and cannot be allowed to go sour.\n\nThe DCAA said that the slots cannot be provided indefinitely and urged them to respond to the offer on or before Thursday December 20, 2021.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cWe write in reference to Air Peace\u2019s possible/intended operations to/from Dubai Airports (DXB). We have received information from Dubai Airports, with regard to slot availability at DX8 Terminal 1 and as a gesture of goodwill and in support of UAE and Nigeria relations, in case Air Peace wishes to start their flights, slots have been blocked by Dubai Airports.\n\n\u201cSlots available and blocked for Air Peace are the following: AOSSOLT DOSOOLT \u2013 All days and A0S10LT DOSOOLT \u2013 without day 6 .\n\n\u201cAs these slots cannot be blocked indefinitely, we would highly appreciate it if Air Peace could kindly reach out to Dubai Airports -ACL and inform them of their intentions to operate by Thursday 16th December, 2021 and accordingly confirm the blocked slots.\n\n\u201cDubai Airports have also confirmed that dnata \u2014 the ground handling agents at OXB have sent the ground handling quotation to Ms. Reham Mustafa \u2014 Country Manager and also, Emirates Flight Catering is working on the quotation and should send it out latest by tomorrow morning.\n\n\u201d For landing permissions, they could contact our Air Transport Section as detailed below: Landing Permissions: air.transport@dcaa.gov.\u201d\n\nBut Air Peace has denounced knowledge of any letter offering them seven slots to Dubai.\n\nOne of the managers of the airline who did not want his name in print because he was not authorised to talk on the matter said nothing has changed as the airline can still not fly into the UAE.\n\nAccording to the source, the laid down procedure is for the government of the UAE to write directly to the Nigerian government and not to Air Peace directly, even if such a letter existed.\n\nHe queried the sincerity of the UAE government in ending the fiasco, saying \u201cif they are ready to end the crisis, are they not supposed to write to the Nigerian government? They should write to us because this is a diplomatic issue and the diplomatic procedure is for them to write to Nigerian government and not Air Peace\u201d.",

          "title": "APC National chairmanship debate: Let\u2019s end govs\u2019 domineering influence \u2013 Yari",
          "text": "Former governor of Zamfara state and a national chairmanship aspirant of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari, has said it\u2019s time the overbearing influence of governors in internal running of political parties was put under check.\n\nYari also decried the plethora of litigations filed by aggrieved party faithful in the aftermath of the state congresses, just as he promised to entrench a reward system for party loyalists across the country if given opportunity to emerge the next national chairman.\n\nHe spoke Thursday in Abuja at the APC Press Corps second annual lecture with the theme: \u201cAPC Beyond 2023-The Tasks Ahead: The Role of Stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe platform was an intellectual ground for the aspirants for the position of the chairmanship of the party to unveil their plans and programmes.\n\nAt the event were national chairmanship aspirants seeking the endorsement of members.\n\nThe aspirants in attendance included former Nasarawa state Governor, Senator Tanko Almakura, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, Alhaji Yari, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff (represented), former Governor Isa Yuguda (represented), Malam Mustapha Salihu, Sunny Moniedafe, Mohammed Etsu and Senator George Akume (represented).\n\nReeling out his plans for the party, Yari recalled his role in the formation of the APC in 2013, and expressed optimism that the APC would sustain its winning streaks after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari May 29, 2023.\n\nYari urged fellow contenders to guard against the \u201cdo-or-die mentality\u201d as they jostle for elective positions ahead of the 2023 poll.\n\nOn govs\u2019 influence\n\nSpeaking on the governors\u2019 influence on political parties, the former governor said: \u201cThe issue of domination, of course, governors must dominate the party. Why, because they\u2019re the Alpha and the Omega and they are the financers? But we have to change the narrative. Governor, President are members of the party and have their own card number as any member has it.\n\n\u201cIn bringing the members together, we are sharing the same opportunities. It is only that you are given the opportunity to us to serve you as a governor, as Senator, House of Reps, House of Assembly, respectively. So, therefore, if we change the narrative and with members of the party, at least certain direction on the issue of critical importance, then that narrative can be changed.\n\n\u201cAnd also, you can take the fight back to us and determine what is the party going to look like? I know as a governor who served for eight years, I can hear from the background that we dominate. Now I am outside, I\u2019m listening together with outsiders that governors dominate. So, this is very correct. But if we agree, all of us, because no single chairman either from State or the National can do that alone. All of us have to agree, sit down and design how our party is going to look beyond 2023. So, if we agree to do that, then we can get that one out.\u201d\n\nMusa\n\nOn his agenda, another aspirant, Senator Musa representing Niger East Senatorial district in the National Assembly, stressed the need to reorganise the party structure that would usher in an era whereby the constitution of the party would be strictly adhered to, to avert recurring crisis plaguing the party.\n\nPromising to sustain the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari administration, the serving lawmaker assured that he would run an all inclusive administration if elected chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cIn so doing, if we make our party an institution whereby it will be governed by the books, the trajectory should be that we should have a Constitution that will be abide by. If you\u2019re a leader, if you are an aspirant, if you are elected to an office, you should know that there is a book, there is a Constitution that we must stand and abide by.\n\n\u201cThe guidelines of the party are there, the manifesto of the party is there. If you are elected under the platform of this party, there is no way you shouldn\u2019t abide by the book that this party has created. Because before you even become a member of this party, you must have agreed to the tenets and the ethics of conduct that the party has laid down and this is my aspiration.\n\n\u201cI want to bring technology to the running of the administration of APC. The internal structure needs to be re-engineered. We need to re-engineer APC. We need a leadership that is participatory. We need a leadership that is pace setting, we need people with ideas to come in,\u201d Musa said.\n\nAl-Makura\n\nAlso speaking, Senator Al-Makura, who paid glowing tribute to the performance of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee, promised to offer selfless services if elected chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cMy objective is to be chairman of the party not for myself, not about my ego but it\u2019s about sustaining the gains so far recorded in the party. As one opportune by providence to be part of those that participated in the merger of the legacy parties, I am here to partake in value addition to the party,\u201d he said.\n\nLG autonomy\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, an APC chieftain and Director General Voice of Nigeria (VON) Osita Okechukwu, said the party as a matter of urgency, must re-jig its progressive credentials ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe asked the APC governors to stop opposing President Buhari\u2019s reforms, especially on local government autonomy.\n\nOkechukwu said Nigeria cannot claim to be in democracy when democracy at the sub-national level is under lock and key.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the political spectrum Mr. President has embarked on incremental restructuring by alteration of our Constitution to oblige first line charge of funding to State legislatures and judiciary as captured in Section 121 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. When the governors aping Emperors in an unusual Bipartisanship ganged up to oppose the extension of frontiers of democracy to sub-national units, he signed the Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cOne humbly appeals to APC governors to urgently align with Mr. President to liberate democratic institutions at the state level. For Rubber-Stamp legislatures and non-independent State Judiciary are ill-wind which blow no good to our fledgling democracy. The Progressive Governors Forum should stand up to be counted by not only liberating state legislatures and Judiciary but Local Government Councils.\u201d\n\nOn the need to reposition the ruling APC, the VON boss said: \u201cTo rejig our progressive credentials, consolidate and transform our dear party and by extension our dear country; we must take APC Manifesto as our Bible and our Koran. For the avoidance of doubt, our manifesto is structured around the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy.\n\n\u201cMe thinks one of the challenges is the mistake of taking the conduct of party primaries as the core function of the National Working Committee (NWC) of our party.\n\n\u201cCapital No! The primary role of the National Working Committee of our great party is oversight functions of those elected and appointed to government \u2013 local, state and federal tier on our platform. NWC is the enforcer of the guardrails as per the religious execution of the Manifesto of our party by those elected and appointed on our platform.\n\n\u201cHad the NWC played their enforcer role diligently the federal government since 2015 could have saved over N2 trillion pumped into our privatised electricity chain without commensurate result.\u201d\n\nPGF replies\n\nResponding to Okechukwu\u2019s submission on governors opposing local government autonomy, Director General Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Moh Lukman faulted the claim.\n\nLukman said: \u201cThe PDP governors were opposed to it. APC governors elected to support the reform, that\u2019s the matter, just to correct the impression out there.\u201d\n\nState chairs\n\nMeanwhile, the APC state chairmen Thursday vowed to resist any attempt to derail the current party leadership under Governor Buni.\n\nThe party leaders said they have \u201cresolved that any sponsor of crisis in our party should desist from that because the state chairmen resolve that they will not tolerate such sponsorship and if we know we will do the needful in our various states before the national will hear about it.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja, spokesman of the State Chairmen Forum, Prophet Jones Ode Erue, urged the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to concentrate on its assignment.\n\n\u201d So, we stand by the Constitutionality of our party, we stand with the leadership of his Excellency Mai Mala Buni and we will continue to give hand of fellowship, we will continue to give the backing needed, we will continue to fight in the trenches with you, we will continue to call it our party.\n\n\u201cWe want to say that our party, the All Progressives Congress is greater than any individual, therefore, its existence is paramount to us and we are not going to mortgage it for any reason. We are not going to destroy our APC for any reason. Therefore, we State Chairmen resolve and we stand resolved that we stand with the leadership of our great party under the leadership of his Excellency, Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cWe are not in military regime, we operate a constitution. Therefore, anybody in whatever form they come to challenge the corporate existence of our party we State Chairmen resolve we will stand against such force no matter who is behind the force because this is our party we have no other party apart from APC.\n\n\u201cWe want the leadership of the party to know and get rest assured that we are with them in this, the unison of our party so that our party will move from strength to strength no matter what it is. And the issue of any group of person thinking they can just hang up anywhere and arrogate power to themselves and say we dethrone, we enthrone, we scatter, we discatter, we State Chairmen resolve that the national leadership should know that this is an issue we will ruthlessly deal with in our various States.\u201d\n\nCECPC scribe\n\nAlso speaking, the APC National Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe said Nigerians would not replace APC with a government that would spend the nation\u2019s resources to buy brassier in 2023.\n\nSenator Akpanudoedehe also went spiritual while countering the newly elected national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Iyorchia Ayu\u2019s assertion that APC would break up April 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cI learnt that the new PDP chairman made a prophecy that we will scatter before April.\n\n\u201cI replied by saying that the Bible says take council together, it shall come to nothing. Speak the word, it will not stand, rather we will be stronger and stronger. Let me send a message to PDP, if we are talking about replacing APC, it can never be you because Nigerians are too intelligent.\n\n\u201cNigerians will still choose APC. Talk is cheap, even when you sponsor crisis throughout Nigeria, we won all our bye-elections. We inherited insurgency and we have dealt with it. As we speak, not one inch of Nigeria\u2019s territory is being taken over by any group. That is why they have turned themselves to criminals. When PDP were in government, they took over everywhere but today, it is different.\n\n\u201cMaybe because the President is not the talking type, I am challenging anyone to show me any social intervention programme better than this government. People are collecting alerts for COVID-19 palliative. Youths, women, civil servants are collecting it.\n\n\u201cIf you have a minister who served under that government and the minister bought a brassier worth 1 million, we cannot replace APC with brassier government. We just got another information that another account has been discovered.\u201d\n\nKalu seeks postponement of APC national convention\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu has the Buni-led committee and members of the planning committee to postpone the party\u2019s national convention slated for February.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Governor Buni, the lawmaker urged the party\u2019s national leadership to conduct the presidential primary and election of National Working Committee members simultaneously at the convention.\n\nTitled: \u201cUrgent appeal for postponement of APC National Convention\u201d, the letter warned that holding the convention February without resolving pockets of disagreements trailing the congresses of the party may lead to implosion.\n\nKalu said: \u201cIt is with a sense of commitment and unflinching loyalty to our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) that I write to you, the content of this letter regarding the National Convention of our party slated for February, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to commend your sterling leadership qualities in helping to stabilise our great party across the six-geopolitical zones, with high profile defections to the party to your credit as an outstanding party leader.\n\n\u201cI must also commend your peaceful disposition and sense of commitment to the growth of our party which also saw very peaceful congresses across the states.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is pertinent to note that, some states are embroiled in crisis with multiple factions.\n\n\u201cI must also commend your peaceful disposition and sense of commitment to the growth of our party which also saw very peaceful congresses across the states.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is pertinent to note that, some states are embroiled in crisis with multiple factions.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the creation of factions denied the party victory in so many states because the crisis was never settled. As a peaceful and tactful leader, I am sure you wouldn\u2019t allow such scenario to reoccur.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that I write to appeal to your office and members of the Convention Extraordinary Planning Committee to reconsider the slated date for the 2022 National Convention.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we collectively save the party from implosion due to the numerous court cases across the states.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that you reconsider the date due to the confusions with regards to the zoning of offices.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after the state congresses, the burgeoning morale of party members was badly affected.\n\n\u201cIt would be devastating to continue with the convention without settling the differences in our various states and, sort out the issues of zoning which in my opinion, cannot be addressed in two months.\n\n\u201cThe logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts is that having too many cases without settling them amicably, the APC may be embarking upon a collision course which may lead the party to implosion.\n\n\u201cIt is important to first postpone the convention with all peace and reconciliation machineries fully put in place.\n\n\u201cThe issue of zoning should be properly handled with even representation across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, I am suggesting for a simultaneous event of having the presidential primary and election of National Working Committee (NWC) members on the same day and venue to avoid rancour and litigations.\n\n\u201cAs a listening and kind hearted leader, I am confident that you will consider my humble appeal to postpone the convention.\n\n\u201cThank you in advance for your kind consideration and understanding.\u201d",

Once that right of free choice is violated, the basis of democracy and its product, good governance, is undermined.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure some of the conversation today will look at this fundamental point\u2026how can we protect the vote, how do we ensure that every vote counts; how do we protect the government of the people, by the people, and for the people; and ensure, as Lincoln famously prayed at Gettysburg, that it does not perish from the earth?\u201d\n\nThe vice president described the late governor as \u201can exceptional communicator and a natural bridge builder, who attained early success in the oil and gas industry, and then emerged as an astute politician, Senator of the Federal Republic, and two-term governor of Oyo state.\u201d\n\nHe said the late senator was \u201ca remarkable human being, an extraordinarily gifted man, astute politician, accomplished public intellectual and administrator in his own right.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also commissioned the Senator Abiola Ajimobi Resource Centre built by the Senator Abiola Ajimobi Foundation at the Institute for Peace and Strategic Studies (IPSS), University of Ibadan, Oyo state.\n\nDignitaries at the event hosted by the late governor\u2019s wife, Mrs. Florence Ajimobi included deputy governors of Oyo and Osun states, Rauf Olaniyan and Benedict Gboyega Alabi; Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare, traditional rulers and top government officials.",

          "text": "More than 20 people were feared dead after a fire broke out Friday in a building in Osaka in western Japan, officials said, and police were investigating arson as a possible cause.\n\nThe fire started on the fourth floor of an eight-story building in the major business, shopping and entertainment area of Kitashinchi, Osaka fire department official Akira Kishimoto said.\n\nTwenty-seven people were found in a state of cardiac arrest and one other woman was injured, Kishimoto said. The woman was conscious and brought down by an aerial ladder from a window on the sixth floor and was being treated in a hospital.\n\nLater Friday, 19 people were pronounced dead and three others were resuscitated, NHK national television and other media reported. Japanese authorities declined to confirm those reports.\n\nIn Japan, the authorities customarily describe those without vital signs as being in \u201cshinpai teishi\u201d or a state of cardiac and pulmonary arrest, and do not confirm deaths until they are pronounced at hospitals and other necessary procedures are done.\n\nA doctor at one of the hospitals treating the victims said he believed many of them died after inhaling carbon monoxide as they had limited external injuries.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said \u201cmany people have died or being in a state of heart and lung failures,\u201d without disclosing the exact number. Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura offered condolences.\n\nThe building houses an internal medicine clinic, an English language school and other businesses. Many of the victims are believed to be visitors at the clinic on the fourth floor, fire department officials said.\n\nThe cause of the fire and other details were not immediately known. Osaka police said they were investigating to determine whether the fire was caused by arson or an accident.\n\nMedia reports said police were searching for a man who witnesses saw carrying a paper bag from which an unidentified liquid was dripping. Police declined to confirm those reports.\n\nNHK said a female outpatient at the clinic\u2019s reception desk saw the man, while another person nearby said the fire started soon after he put the leaky bag on the floor.\n\nPeople on other floors of the building were believed to have been safely evacuated, Kishimoto said.\n\nNHK quoted a witness as saying she heard a woman\u2019s voice coming from the fourth floor calling for help. Another witness told TV Asahi he saw flames and smoke coming out of windows on the fourth floor when he stepped outside after hearing a commotion.\n\nIn total, 70 fire engines were mobilized to fight the fire, which was fully extinguished more than six hours later, officials said.\n\nIn 2019 at the Kyoto Animation studio, an attacker stormed into the building and set it on fire, killing 36 people and injuring more than 30 others. The incident shocked Japan and drew an outpouring of grief from anime fans worldwide. In 2001, an intentionally set blaze in Tokyo\u2019s Kabukicho entertainment district killed 44 people \u2014 the country\u2019s worst known case of arson in modern times.",

          "text": "The World Bank on Thursday announced its approval of a $700 million credit from its International Development Association (IDA) for the Nigeria Agro-Climatic Resilience in Semi-Arid Landscapes (ACReSAL) Project.\n\nThe project is expected to increase the implementation of sustainable landscape management practices in northern Nigeria and strengthen the country\u2019s long-term enabling environment for integrated climate-resilient landscape management.\n\nAccording to a statement from the multilateral institution, the productivity of major crops in Nigeria had been steadily declining over the past two decades, in part due to climate change, forcing an expansion of the area under agriculture and increased imports to meet the food needs of Nigeria\u2019s growing population.\n\nIt noted that persistent water shortages, especially in the extreme north, continue to exacerbate land degradation, desertification, and habitat loss.\n\n\u201cResource shortages, violent conflict, outdated agricultural systems not adapted to changing dryland conditions, lack of access to finance, weak value chain linkages, an uncompetitive environment for agribusiness, and poor market access are other key barriers to increased agricultural productivity in Nigeria. \u201cBetter environmental and water resources management and resilience against disaster and climate risks (largely water-related) are needed to sustain economic growth and protect the most vulnerable,\u201d it added.\n\nWorld Bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri noted that Nigeria was faced with water scarcity and droughts which occur every five years, on average, with the potential to increase in frequency due to climate change.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis scenario not only threatens food security, livelihoods, and productivity, but also exacerbates fragility and increases the risk of violence.\n\n\u201cWith communities and households that are most dependent on natural resources for their survival and vulnerable to desertification, this intervention will improve multi-sectoral watershed planning and investments to help about 3.4 million direct beneficiaries adapt to evolving dryland conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based institution pointed out that in recent years, the Government of Nigeria had established several initiatives in the agriculture sector to combat desertification including afforestation and reforestation programs, dissemination of proven agricultural technologies and sustainable agricultural practices, and promotion of efficient energy sources.\n\nHowever, it stated that efforts to stop and reverse desertification had been complicated by the need to feed a rapidly increasing population in a region where natural resources were dwindling and over 90 percent of national food production depends on smallholder farmers who lack the capacity to increase food production without degrading land.\n\nThe ACReSAL Project is a 6-year strategic project prioritising actions within four components: Dryland Management, Community Climate Resilience, Institutional Strengthening and Project Management, and Contingent Emergency Response.\n\nIt is expected to improve the capacity of the country to adapt to a changing climate, largely through enhancing multi-sectoral convergence (across environment, agriculture and water) and technology modernisation, including improved use of data, analytics, and connectivity.\n\n\u201cThe project will specifically target the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalised groups, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, internally displaced people, and ethnic and religious minorities using an integrated watershed approach across sectors and levels of governance,\u201d Task Team Leader, ACReSAL, World Bank, Joy Iganya Agene said.\n\n\u201cThis will help reduce the vulnerability of millions of the extreme poor in northern Nigeria, strengthening their own role in the management of their natural resources while also addressing land degradation, strengthening climate resilience, and lessening livelihood vulnerability in dry, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions in the northern states,\u201d Agene added.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s IDA established in 1960, helps the world\u2019s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people\u2019s lives.\n\nObinna Chima",

Your selfless and foresighted leadership has brought unity and cohesion to the party, and greatly contributed to making the APC the most freely embraced political platform in the history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr President, your leadership of Nigeria is a blessing to our dear country as it offers our people and institutions confidence in confronting the current challenges and in laying the foundation for sustainable prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly will continue to work with you in line with our shared vision and in the best interest of our dear nation,\u201d Lawan says.\n\nOn his part, Gbajabiamila, said the president has done great things for Nigeria since he came to power in 2015 and should be celebrated by all well-meaning Nigerians on his birthday.\n\nThe Speaker, while lauding Buhari for putting Nigeria first before any other consideration, said at 79, the president has achieved a lot both as an individual and as a leader with uncommon character and integrity.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the president would do a lot more for the country in the remaining period of his administration.\n\n\u201cMr President, Nigeria and Nigerians are proud of you. The way you have been steering the ship of the Nigerian state has been commendable. I, therefore, join millions of our compatriots to wish you a happy birthday and more years in good health,\u201d he said\n\nAlso, Sanwo-Olu, in his congratulatory message, described President Buhari as a courageous and passionate leader, whose commitment to the growth and development of Nigeria is worthy of emulation.\n\nIn the congratulatory message by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, Sanwo-Olu said Buhari has provided honest and transparent leadership in the country, as well as demonstrated unparalleled leadership skills, patriotism, integrity and courage in steering the ship of Nigeria since he assumed office on May 29, 2015.\n\n\u201cYou have contributed immensely to the unity, growth and development of Nigeria right from your youthful days till date, having served in different capacities as Minister of Petroleum Resources, Head of State and currently President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Commander -in- Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cI hereby join family, friends, associates, leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in celebrating President Buhari\u2019s 79th birthday. I wish our President more prosperous years in good health and wisdom as he continues to serve our dear nation,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, in his tribute described Buhari as a hero, who met Nigeria at the crossroads of socio-economic challenges, and has already left footprints on the sands of time.\n\nIn a statement by his Media Office in Abuja , Senator Ngige described the President as a colossus, who upon crossing the the Rubicon in 2015, retrieved Nigeria from a threatening morass, and set her on a fruitful march of socio-economic and political recovery.\n\n\u201cAt crossroads in 2015, Nigeria needed a statesman, an honest leader with an undistracted focus on national rebirth and the lot fell on President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cSix years in saddle, despite teething challenges, worsened by COVID-19 pandemic, which shut and brought the entire world on bended knees, Nigeria has trudged on, first through the Era of Change and now, the consolidation moment of the Next Level. Many projects met on ground have been completed, in some cases, expanded and new ones initiated.\n\n\u201cThe incipient return to national food sufficiency, through the expanded horizon on agricultural production, and the arising job opportunities in the production value chains. The expansion of roads and railway infrastructures, illustrating the unambiguous commitment to national infrastructural rebirth, and summarized by the administration\u2019s five legacy projects viz, the 2nd Niger Bridge, now 80% completed, the Lagos-Ibadan-Ilorin-Kaduna road, East-West road, Abuja-Kaduna-Kano road and the Mambilla Project and more!\n\n\u201cThe improving legacy of credible elections exemplified in abundance by the President, in the recent off-season elections in Edo and Anambra is at the heart of national revival. I\u2019m therefore optimistic that by the time the President completes his term in 2023, Nigerians will look back with joy at the long standing commitment, steadfastness and sacrifices of this President,\u201d he said.",
