          "title": "Lawyer threatens NRC with legal action after train ran out of fuel",
          "text": "An Ibadan-based lawyer, Barrister Abiodun Amole, has threatened to commence legal action against the Nigerian Railway Corporation.\n\nHe the need to commence the legal action was necessary due to the fact that he was one of the passengers who boarded a train which recently ran out of fuel.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that a Lagos-bound train, which carried some passengers from Ibadan, had last week run out of fuel.\n\nIt was learnt that hundreds of passengers who boarded the train were stranded last Thursday.\n\nAmole, in a petition written by his counsel, Olumide Ojedokun and addressed to the Chairman, Nigerian Railway Corporation, explained that he was completely frustrated when the train ran out of fuel.\n\nOjedokun in the petition written on behalf of Amole, a copy of which was made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan on Thursday, further revealed that the petitioner and other passengers who boarded the train were stranded in the thick forest with all the attendant security implications.\n\nHe said that his client and other passengers were almost choked to death in the stuffy cabin and were all sweating profusely throughout the time the train got stuck.\n\nHe maintained that what happened is a clear breach of the implied contract Nigerian Railway Corporation entered into with Amole to take him to Lagos on schedule.\n\nOjedokun demanded the sum of N250 million as compensation on behalf of his client.\n\nHe said that his client will have no other option than to commence proceedings against the corporation in the court of law for negligence and breach of contract if it fails to pay the money within 30 days.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe act as solicitors to Mr. Abiodun Amole, a resident of Ibadan, Oyo State and the Head of Chambers, Adeniyi Akintola (SAN) & Co. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cour client\u201d) and we write this letter pursuant to his instructions. We have been informed by our aforementioned client that he boarded your Corporation\u2019s morning train service from Ibadan to Lagos at the Moniya, Ibadan train station on Thursday 10th March, 2022 at 8am and was scheduled to get to Lagos at 10 am.\n\n\u201cOur client was in the first class cabin and got ticket No. FC 143235 and seat No. C8/21. Our client was travelling to Port-Harcourt, Rivers State en route Lagos and had planned to attend to very urgent official matters at his law firm\u2019s Lagos office at Lekki for at least two hours before proceeding to the local wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Ikeja to board the Air Peace 2:30 pm flight P47194 from Lagos to Port-Harcourt.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, your Corporation completely frustrated/disrupted our client\u2019s plan to arrive Lagos on schedule on account of its sheer negligence and ineptitude as the train boarded by our client and several other passengers negligently ran out of fuel and consequently broke down during the journey and left our client and the other passengers stranded in the thick forest, for no fault of theirs with all the attendant security implications.\n\n\u201cThe ordeal of our client and the other passengers is better imagined than experienced as they were subjected to serious apprehension and fear of a possible imminent violent attack by criminals using forests as their hideout to perpetrate their nefarious activities.\n\nThe development further caused our client untold psychological, mental and emotional trauma as his memory was constantly filled with the worsening security situation in the country characterized by kidnapping, abduction, banditry and ritual killings throughout the period he was stranded along with the other passengers in the forest. Our client and all the other hapless passengers were, so to say, \u201cin the lion\u2019s den\u201d, throughout the turbulent period.\n\n\u201cOur client and all the other passengers almost choked to death in the stuffy cabin and were all sweating profusely throughout the time the train got stuck. It was indeed hell on earth, to put it mildly. The development, we wish to state constitutes the tort of negligence on the part of your Corporation as well as a clear breach of the implied contract it entered into with our client to take him to Lagos on schedule.\n\n\u201cWe have our client\u2019s instructions to demand and we hereby accordingly demand the payment of the sum of N250, 000,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Million Naira) as compensation on behalf of our client to be paid through this chambers within 30 (Thirty) days of your receipt of this letter, failing which we shall have no option than to perfect our client\u2019s further instructions to commence proceedings against the Nigerian Railway Corporation in the court of law for the tort of negligence and/or breach of contract and seek appropriate declaratory reliefs and heavy damages with all the attendant dire consequences, publicity and embarrassment\u201d.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has confirmed the removal of electricity subsidies by the federal government, adding that the commission will review tariff rates every six months.\n\nOver the weekend, Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, had announced the removal of subsidy on electricity tariff.\n\nSpeaking during a press briefing on Wednesday, Sanusi Garba, NERC chairman, said the commission played a role in ensuring that tariff rates were regulated.\n\n\u201cThe role of the commission is to make a determination of the rates that consumers should pay. So we strike a balance between consumers and investors,\u201d Garba said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said that the electricity subsidy had been reduced in the past four to five years over its unsustainability regarding investors\u2019 return on investments.\n\n\u201cNow subsidy is a policy issue determined by the government. The government will decide that the rates calculated or agreed by the regulator may at this time not be passed on to consumers. It has happened many times,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the past four, five years the level of subsidy has gradually been reduced, because you cannot run the electricity market on life support and say that investors cannot get their return on investment until government steps in to provide the required funding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo that policy decision (stopping electricity subsidy) is as announced by the Minister of Finance.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Sokowatch, an e-commerce company offering tech-enabled supply chain solutions to Africa\u2019s informal retailers, on Wednesday said it has closed a $125 million Series B equity round at a valuation of $625 million, per TechCrunch.\n\nAlongside the new funding, the company has rebranded to Wasoko, which translates to \u201cPeople of the Market\u201d in Swahili and also launched in Abidjan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Dakar (Senegal), its first locations in West Africa.\n\nInitially launched in Kenya by founder and CEO Daniel Yu in 2015, Sokowatch scaled into neighboring East African markets Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda in 2018. The West Africa expansion thus brings its total markets to 6.\n\nSokowatch explains in a statement its new brand reflects a \u201cshift from its origins as a backend distribution software platform in East Africa to a public brand providing free delivery of essential goods and working capital financing to informal retailers across opposite ends of the African continent\u201d.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhat Wasoko does\n\nMore than $600 billion of consumer goods are sold in Africa through informal retail channels every year, supplying the vast majority of the 1.2 billion population.\n\nDespite its importance, the informal retail sector still remains highly fragmented and inefficient with local shops facing a number of major challenges including frequent stockouts, limited access to capital, and difficulty receiving goods from suppliers.\n\nThrough Wasoko\u2019s platform, informal retailers are able to order products at any time via SMS or mobile app for free same-day delivery to their stores. And leveraging purchasing data, the platform also evaluates retailers to provide them with access to Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) financing.\n\n\u201cInformal retailers capture the vast majority of consumer spending in Africa, and they are dramatically underserved by existing distribution and financial infrastructure,\u201d Andrew Sugrue, Founding Partner at Avenir Growth Capital said on the VC firm\u2019s investment in Wasoko. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about what Wasoko is building and the efficiencies it brings to these retailers and their suppliers.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasoko claims to have delivered 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal with revenue growth over the past 12 months at over 500%. It currently has more than 800 full-time employees across Africa.\n\nOn why the company is expanding into francophone West African markets instead of Nigeria, which is arguably the largest market for informal retail in Africa, Yu explains to TechCrunch that the choice reflects the strong growth that its choice countries have exhibited in the region overall.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the past 10 years, both Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire have experienced solid year-on-year GDP growth,\u201d the CEO said. But Wasoko adds it is exploring expansion into Southern Africa and Nigeria nonetheless while continuing to consolidate its position across its six current countries.\n\nA mega-round for the record books\n\nLed by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth Capital, Wasoko\u2019s latest raise is the second-largest venture financing round ever secured by a non-fintech startup in Africa and the largest in the B2B retail e-commerce space, where a host of players like TradeDepot, MarketForce, Omnibiz, Alerzo, and others ply their trade.\n\nThe round comes 2 years after Wasoko closed a $14 million Series A and saw participation from VNV Global; Binny Bansal, co-founder of Flipkart; and Sujeet Kumar, co-founder of Udaan; Quona Capital; 4DX Ventures; and JAM Fund.\n\nThe new capital will enable Wasoko to drive further geographic expansion and product growth across the continent, according to the company.\n\nThe company said it is also examining opportunities to expand its product offering to verticals such as merchant point-of-sale systems, bill payments, and social commerce through both internal innovation as well as strategic investments and acquisitions of relevant companies.\n\nIn addition to the fundraising and rebranding, Wasoko has made several appointments to its senior leadership team.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s struggling economy in 7 charts",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s economy has continued to struggle to keep up to its title \u2018Africa\u2019s largest economy\u2019 with its dwindling oil production, low standard of living, and the rising cost of goods and services.\n\nFrom stabilising its oil production which is the country\u2019s largest source of revenue to keeping its foreign reserve afloat to strengthening its weak naira, the country has a long way to go with having the strong economy it desires.\n\nHere are seven charts that shows the Nigerian economy struggles;\n\nCrude oil has been accelerating since November 2021 when it was an average of $67.57 and it has since then increased to an average of $95.22 for the month of February.\n\nPetrol-dollar economies like Nigeria anticipate an increase in price as this means more money to fund their budgets. This however isn\u2019t the case for Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy, which has seen a decline in oil production over the past months.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has continued to see instability with its oil production. According to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) report, the direct sources show that Nigeria produced 1.26 million barrels per day in February 2022 compared to the 1.42 million barrels of oil produced daily in the same month last year.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s economy unravels at worst time ahead elections\n\nThe latest oil production is a decline from the 1.39 million barrels of oil produced in January 2022.\n\n\u201cCrude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia and Libya, while production in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea declined,\u201d the report noted.\n\nWhile the oil cartel indicated that the increasing oil price might have provided ample support for the Nigerian economy.\n\nHowever, it noted that \u201cthe disruption to global trade flows and supply shortages could offset this positive impact.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign reserve has declined to $39.86 billion as of February 28, 2022, the lowest since September 2021, when it stood at $36.78 billion. This is despite the increase in the price of crude oil, Nigeria\u2019s main source of foreign exchange.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC, said Nigeria had not benefited from the oil rally because of its low crude oil production and the rising cost of petrol subsidy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation spurred in February 2022 to 15.7 percent, the highest since October 2021 when it was 15.99 percent.\n\nThe core inflationary pressures mirrored the recent surge in the cost of energy-related products, it increased to 14.01 percent year on year in February 2022 compared to 13.87 percent in the previous month.\n\nHowever, food inflation declined to 17.11 percent compared to the previous month when 17.13 percent. This slight decrease is however not a great delight to many as it is not a true representation of the rising prices of food in the market due to the scarcity and surge in the price of fuel and higher cost of transportation.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war could also contribute to the spike in food prices which is a major contributing factor to headline inflation.\n\nNigeria should expect an outbreak of food scarcity in the next three months as adverse consequences of the Russian-Ukraine war begin to come home to roost, Aliko Dangote, chairman, and chief executive of Dangote Group has said.\n\nThe CBN said last month it would stop selling foreign currency to Banks by the end of the year to encourage them to source their own dollars and also support the government\u2019s target to lure $200 billion of inflows yearly by 2025.\n\nTo this effect, Nigeria\u2019s largest banks are reducing dollar spending limits on local currency cards to free more resources to fund imports after the central bank signalled it will stop foreign-exchange sales to banks.\n\nThis means individuals who carry out transactions above the new spending limit would now have to get a dollar card or visit the parallel market for their transactions.\n\nNigerian households have been facing difficulty as the average price for refilling a 5kg or 12.5kg cylinder of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) has continued to rise steadily over the past one year.\n\nAccording to the February 2021 Cooking Gas Watch report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the average price of 12.5kg of the commodity increased to N7,413 in January 2022 from N4178 in January 2022 while the 5kg gas increased to N3658 from N1949 in January 2021.\n\nExperts blame the price hike of cooking gas on the dearth of infrastructure, global shortfall in gas supply, inadequate local production, and shortage of Foreign Exchange, devaluation of the naira, logistic hitches and the recent introduction of VAT charges on imported gas by the Federal Government.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst said, \u201cIt is unlikely that gas prices will trend downwards in the near term considering inadequate local supply of the commodity, foreign-exchange induced pressure on importation and the fact that petroleum products will remain on the high-side for a while.\u201d\n\nThe price of Automotive Gas Oil, popularly known as diesel, has increased by almost 160 per cent in one year to N540-570 per litre in the past few days of March this year, from N235 in March last year.\n\nData gleaned from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the average price paid by consumers for diesel increased to N312 in February 2022 from N228 in the same month last year.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, followed the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nEsu Olumba-Obu, the Group managing director of Royal Farms Ltd says the high cost of diesel is posing serious threats in sustaining the group business.\n\n\u201cDue to the high cost of diesel, most businesses are now faced with the option of closing down or retrenching staff to survive,\u201d Olumba-Obu told BusinessDay.",

          "text": "Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer, saw its petrol import bill hit an all-time high of almost N4 trillion last year, nearly double that of 2020, official data collated by BusinessDay show.\n\nThe country relies wholly on imports to meet its fuel needs as its refineries have remained in a state of disrepair for many years despite several reported repairs.\n\nThe amount spent on the importation of Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) alone in 2021 jumped by 97.01 percent to N3.96 trillion from N2.01 trillion, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe NBS data showed that petrol imports gobbled up N1.44 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year, a 37 percent increase compared to N1.05 trillion in Q3, N782.46 billion in Q2 and N687.74 billion in Q1.\n\nTop officials of the two biggest oil marketers\u2019 associations in Nigeria who spoke to BusinessDay blamed the surging petrol imports bill on oil price rally, smuggling of petrol to neighbouring countries and naira devaluation.\n\n\u201cThe 97 percent increase is based on few things outside Nigeria\u2019s control and a large chunk of things within its control,\u201d Michael Osatuyi, national operations coordinator of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, said.\n\nHe listed higher international oil prices as being outside Nigeria\u2019s control and smuggling and \u201cunjustifiable petrol consumption\u201d as within the country\u2019s control.\n\nThe international oil benchmark, Brent crude, averaged $70.68 per barrel last year, up from $41.96 per barrel in 2020.\n\n\u201cDue to current economic reality, I can assure you Nigeria\u2019s petroleum bill will increase by 70 percent next year, because of the country\u2019s inability to curtail smuggling,\u201d Osatuyi said.\n\nClement Isong, executive secretary/chief executive officer of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, attributed the 2021 increase to the improved economic activities compared to 2020 and the petrol price differential between Nigeria and its neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the only West African country selling petrol at one-third of the international price,\u201d Isong told BusinessDay.\n\nHe said the Federal Government would pay more for petrol importation this year because the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd \u201cis currently oversupplying the market as a result of the dirty petrol saga.\u201d\n\nThe deregulation of petrol pricing, which is contained in the Petroleum Industry Act, is yet to kick off as the Federal Government, through the NNPC, remains the sole importer of the product and continues to subsidise the pump price, which is currently fixed at N162-N165 per litre.\n\nThe Federal Government had in January proposed to extend the subsidy removal implementation period by 18 months, saying it would engage the legislature for the amendment of the PIA.\n\n\u201cThe desire to smuggle petrol outside the country is currently very high due to price arbitrage,\u201d Isong said.\n\nRead also: Nigeria will use Eurobond cash to fund 2022 petrol subsidy- Minister of finance\n\nMany stakeholders have lamented that the country\u2019s petrol subsidy is denying the country value that could have accrued from higher oil prices.\n\nThe country is spending less money on basic education than it does importing petrol and subsidy. The cost of importing petrol last year is more than 40 times larger than the entire 2021 budget of N94.4 billion meant to pay for free universal basic education.\n\nBusinessDay had on March 9 reported that Nigeria\u2019s 2022 petrol subsidy looked set to outpace its budgeted oil revenue of N3.36 trillion as global oil prices are expected to remain at record highs.\n\n\u201cThe cost of stopping smuggling is getting higher than the cost of subsidy, which is unsustainable,\u201d Niyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited, said.\n\nNNPC\u2019s boss, Mele Kyari, had in June last year told journalists that the country consumed 103 million litres per day in May 2021 and between 60 million and 70 million litres daily the following month.\n\nResponding to the development, the Federal Government had mobilised some federal agencies like the Customs, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Police, Civil Defence Corps and others, to curb the menace of fuel smuggling, but it is not clear how much progress has been made.\n\nSmugglers are constantly devising new tactics to outsmart the system and create other routes of transporting petroleum products to neighbouring countries where they sell at higher prices.\n\nBusinessDay reached out to EFCC\u2019s spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, to get an update on how its agency is curbing the current tactics smugglers are using.\n\n\u201cFighting petrol smuggling involves multi-government agencies, not just EFCC alone. Reach out to NNPC for any information you are looking. They are the ones coordinating the activities,\u201d Uwujaren said.\n\nSeveral efforts to reach NNPC\u2019s spokesman, Garba Mohammed, through calls and text messages proved abortive as at close of business on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe fuel subsidy is a mess \u2013 a mess that President Buhari, who marketed himself as a mess-cleaner, has had problems with cleaning up,\u201d said Awodeyi, adding, \u201cWe are yet to see any significant changes either in the pattern of petrol consumption or subsidy payments.\u201d",

          "text": "Following the ban by the Federal Government on direct purchase of farm produce by foreigners from farmers, experts have said commodity exchanges rather than licensed agents will be the best option for farmers.\n\nThe Federal Government has last week announced the ban, with the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, saying appropriate mechanisms have been approved to ensure competitive prices for commodities of indigenous farmers in a bid to protect them from exploitation.\n\nAccording to him, only licensed local buying agents who must be registered by the relevant national commodity associations will be able to buy goods directly from the farmers and sell to the foreigners.\n\n\u201cThe international practice is through licensed warehouses or the commodity exchange. The ban has brought the country a step closer but a functional commodity exchange is a long-term solution,\u201d Obiora Madu, chief executive of Multimix Group, said.\n\n\u201cThe licensed agents will only become middlemen and would frustrate the process,\u201d Madu, a former chairman of the export group at Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, added.\n\nA commodities exchange is a legal entity that determines and enforces rules and procedures for trading standardised commodity contracts and related investment products.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, currently has three commodity exchanges that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, two of which are privately owned \u2013 AFEX Commodities Exchange Limited and Lagos Commodities and Futures Exchange.\n\nThe Nigerian Commodity Exchange, formerly Abuja Securities & Commodities, which is the only government commodity exchange, is yet to commence operations.\n\nThe exchanges offer spot contracts while futures contracts are also available in one of the exchanges. Future contracts are generally cash-settled by the retail traders, but can also be physically settled for select commodities.\n\nRead also: AFEX decry over N2 trillion funding gap in agriculture sector\n\nIn Nigeria, most foreign traders, especially Indians, work hand in hand with some Nigerians in purchasing agricultural produce directly from farmers, thereby causing market distortions.\n\n\u201cThe foreigners buying directly from the farms were distorting the market and not giving stability to the value chain. But with the ban on their access, all these will be addressed now,\u201d said Tola Faseru, executive chairman of Colossus Investments Limited.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are concerned about the implementation because we want the middlemen to be regulated in the value chain, so they don\u2019t distort the market.\n\n\u201cIt is easy for a foreigner to get a Nigerian to buy for him directly from the farm gate. We need a mechanism in place to ensure that they buy from commodity exchanges or warehouses as it is done globally.\u201d\n\nHe said the implementation of the new regulation would create jobs for Nigerians and reduce illegal exports of the country\u2019s agricultural commodities.\n\nThe country\u2019s export sector is still largely unorganised, undocumented, and hard to track, as the majority of trade takes place in the informal sector, which is prone to corruption and robs the government of the much-needed revenue.\n\nThe Nigeria Export Promotion Council confirmed that about 80 percent of non-oil export transactions of the country were not being recorded, accounting for the wide disparity in official statistics in the country and those provided by the ITC, a subsidiary organisation of the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations Conference on Trade& Development.\n\nThere is often a wide disparity between the ITC data and the data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nBusinessDay compared data from the two and found that more goods were leaving Nigeria unrecorded, due to the lack of formalisation of several businesses in the country.\n\nStakeholders in the sector called on the government at all levels to organise the commodity value chain and regulate the activities of foreign traders in the country.\n\nVincent Iyama, national president of the Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria, commended the government for the ban but called for an effective system to ensure sustainability.\n\n\u201cThere is a structure, value chain and commodity trading must be organised for distribution through the proper channels. We need to adopt the commodity system,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the real farmers are happy with this recent ban, as the licensed agents have always been part of the value chain.",

          "text": "Nigerian internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi, detained by the authorities in the United States for committing multi-million dollars fraud, has yet allegedly committed another $400,000 scam while in prison.\n\nUS prosecutors on Wednesday, March 16, presented documents before the US District Court of California with fresh evidence indicting Hushpuppi of committing fraud and money laundering in a federal correctional facility.\n\nIn court documents obtained from the US Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) for the Central District of California, Hushpuppi, while in a US federal correctional facility, participated in the purchase and laundering of Economic Impact Payment (EIP) debit cards fraudulently obtained from compromised data of US citizens and residents.\n\nEIPs are financial support offered by the US government to residents according to the CARES Act. It is also called stimulus package or stimulus check. One of the ways eligible US residents obtain their EIP is by debit cards. From the documents presented in court, it was found that hackers use data of US residents to file and obtain those debit cards. They sell off these EIP cards in underground marketplaces to other cybercriminals.\n\nUS prosecutors, according to a report by Newsrand, said Hushpuppi\u2019s recent frequent internet usage triggered a red flag and they monitored and recorded his internet activity. The court document read:\n\n\u201cCertain inmates in US detention facilities are allowed certain activities, including access to phone calls, video calls, the internet, and computers with regulated usage\n\n\u201cBetween 28th January 2022 and 4th March 2022, security officers at the US Federal correctional facility, Central District of California, observed more frequent usage of the internet by Abbas.\n\n\u201cWith the knowledge that the crimes Abbas committed which he is being charged for are all internet related crimes, security officers were concerned and informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\n\u201cOn 7th March 2022, investigators obtained a federal search warrant, issued by Central District of California, to monitor and record Abbas\u2019 internet activities.\n\n\u201cSecurity officers at the US Federal correctional facility, Central District of California, were instructed to setup a dedicated computer for Abbas. Any time Abbas requests for access to the internet, he should be given that dedicated computer. Only Abbas should be given that computer.\n\n\u201cFrom 7th March 2022 to 13th March 2022, investigators monitored and recorded Abbas\u2019 internet activities. In this period, he requested internet access daily. He spent an average of 55 minutes for each session.\n\n\u201cDuring this period, we found out that Abbas was actively buying Economic Impact Payments debit cards from an underground cybercriminal marketplace where hackers sell EIP debit cards for Bitcoins.\u201d\n\nThe document went further to detail shocking findings while recording Hushpuppi\u2019s activities, according to Newsrand.\n\nInvestigators found out that Abbas used an underground cybercriminal marketplace called StimulusCard which is a marketplace for hackers to sell EIP debit cards for Bitcoins.\n\nOn StimulusCard, hackers listed EIP debit cards with different balances. Investigators found EIP debit cards with $1,400 balance to as high as $8,000. These EIP cards were applied for by hackers using compromised and stolen data of US citizens and residents.\n\nInvestigators found out that criminals can order a virtual option of EIP debit cards and receive it instantly. They use this for online purchases. Criminals can also order for the plastic version of EIP debit cards and they receive it to their mail address.\n\nAbbas bought between seven to 10 EIP debit cards daily for the period he was recorded. He purchased a total of 58 EIP debit cards in this period, with a total value of $429,800.\n\nOf the 58 EIP debit cards, Abbas chose the virtual card option for 36 EIP cards and he selected the plastic physical card option for 22 EIP cards.\n\nAbbas was in constant communication with one AJ. Abbas sent all the cards he bought from StimulusCard to AJ. Abbas gave instructions to AJ on what to shop online. He gave instructions on what to do with the purchased items. Abbas also gave instructions on cash withdrawal from ATMs with the plastic cards.\n\nIn the document, the prosecutors said Abbas was constantly buying high-end gadgets such as iPhones, gaming consoles, MacBooks, and iPads through his primary contact AJ. Investigators could not ascertain the total proceeds Hushpuppi has laundered from this fraud. Their recorded evidence was for a total of $429,800.\n\nUS prosecutors said they are on a mission to unmask the identity of Abbas\u2019 accomplice AJ. They said they are also working with relevant authorities and bodies to take down the underground cybercriminal marketplace, StimulusCard.",

He has supported so many people in this country to become governors.\n\n\u201cBola Ahmed Tinubu has also supported so many members in the democratic space left, right and centre to be senators and respected members of the house of representatives, and on this note, I have to say that Bola Ahmed Tinubu has no other time to be supported to become president of Nigeria better than now. If there is any time for this man to be supported to achieve his life ambition, it is now.\n\n\u201cI want to say here without fear of contradiction that you are the only one we know, the only one we will support. I said so for yet another reason. Senator Ahmed Tinubu has got everything it takes to be president. He has everything it takes to run for the office of the president.

I have discussed that aspect \u2014 my lifelong ambition with Mr President, that after the end of his term I want to step in his shoes and not step on his toes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe responded to me saying well, \u2018come out let us see you run and we see how best we can promote your democratic credentials\u2019.\n\n\u201cMost people have nothing to offer but questions and create doubt. I am not here to be defensive.

          "text": "All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Kaduna State, Mohammed Sani Abdullahi (Dattijo), has urged members of the Kaduna State House of Assembly to support him in sustaining the laudable achievements of Governor Nasir El-rufai.\n\nDattijo, who was at the Luggard Hall to declare his intention, while appreciating the state lawmakers for advancing the cause of Kaduna State by giving government reform efforts the required legislative support, said that it is imperative that the progress and achievements of the APC in the last seven years are not reversed or derailed.\n\nDattijo, who is the Commissioner for Budget and Planning, said that his interest in the 2023 governorship election was fuelled by the desire to guarantee continuity in governance, especially in the area of evolving development in the State.\n\n\u201cThe journey of progress started by Gov. El-rufai is one we must sustain since governance is a never-ending process. We must secure all that His Excellency has been able to achieve under the platform of the APC as a reform-minded political party. As we gradually come close to the end of the trailblazing administration of Gov. El-rufai, our immediate task is to ensure that the progress and achievements of the APC in the last seven years are not reversed or derailed. I believe that only continuity will guarantee that Kaduna will match forward with the determined leadership it has witnessed under the APC,\u201d he told the lawmakers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe former Chief of Staff to Governor El-Rufai said he has been privileged to learn from the governor and understudy the thinking behind every policy intervention and decision of the APC government. He stressed that he is putting himself forward based on the need to ensure the continuity of excellent performance witnessed in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cMy immediate priority is to sustain the current level of achievements and build on them to advance the development of Kaduna State, expand its security and prosperity, and grow a vibrant economy driven by quality service and transparent leadership. I already have a blueprint for actualizing all these, including one on security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe international development expert noted that his experience as a critical player in the international development circle, with training in development, economy and policy, and with a network in the global community, makes him a perfect fit for the job, especially at a time of dwindling revenue from the federation account and uncertainties surrounding the proceeds from oil, the mainstay of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cAside from the energy, faith and devotion that I bring to this endeavour, my experience in the public sector has equipped me with the required competence to lead Kaduna State to achieve greater prosperity. With your support, I am resolved to deploy my knowledge and youthful energy to offer responsive and responsible leadership, one that prioritizes inclusion and offers everyone a sense of belonging. I\u2019ll work to create opportunities for all and ensure that the progressiveness embedded in the image of our party, the APC, continues to reflect in the ways the government does business,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile soliciting the support of the lawmakers for his candidacy, Dattijo said he was willing to abide by the decision of the governor and the leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cThe world is changing, and Kaduna needs to innovate on the existing reforms of our Leader to make our state work for everyone synthesizing on the gains of building a self-sufficient, secured technology capital in Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe choice we have to make in the upcoming elections will determine the trajectory of our dear State, not just for our generation but for the generation after us. But as we consolidate our Leader\u2019s gains and achievements made by mallam Nasir el-rufai, in \u201cMaking Kaduna Great Again\u201d over the last years, we must remind ourselves that the hard work by our Leader is not futile,\u201d he added.\n\nDattijo was recently appointed an associate and founding member of Dunning Africa Center by the prestigious Henley Business School, University of Reading, United Kingdom.",

As a result of this, the party faces the possibility and prospect of the invalidation of all its activities and actions by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the party has demonstrated its inability to proceed with the issue of effecting change in the leadership of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), in a way that is inclusive, legal and respectful of the time limit set and required for giving the INEC sufficient notice of the time and venue for holding its convention.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these controversies and uncertainties, as enumerated above, pose a real threat to the party; and may lead to a possible non-recognition of its activities, elections and the probable invalidation of all its other actions by INEC. This may ultimately even lead its implosion and non-existence.\n\n\u201cThere is, therefore, an urgent need for the party to, as much as possible, avoid all controversies, litigations and all other necessary distractions and quickly get its acts together.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, therefore, I would like now to direct as follows: a. First, the issue of the leadership of the Caretaker Extra Ordinary Convention Committee (CECC), should immediately return to status quo ante; b. Second, all members of the Governors\u2019 Forum and their followers should desist from any behaviour or utterance that will likely lead to disunity in the ranks of the party, and ultimately jeopardise the transition to the convention; c.

Soludo took over from Willie Obiano.\n\nThe former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor took the oath of office alongside his deputy, Onyeka Ibezim.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Soludo promised to hit the ground running, saying some key members of his government will be announced in a few hours.\n\n\u201cToday is my first day at work. I just reported for duty at 8:55 am to be precise and will work for at least eight hours today,\u201d the newly-sworn in governor said.\n\n\u201cWe had more than a month since the election to celebrate our historic victory. Now is the time to work and there is no minute or kobo to waste in funfair. In a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of my administration and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra Security Council followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries and with my strategy, execution, and evaluation team.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the next few weeks, the list of commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly,\u201d the Aguata-born economist, added.\n\nHe also thanked stakeholders, his supporters, Federal Government agencies like the police, and the people of Anambra State for their roles in his election last November.\n\n\u201cUmu nnem Ndi Anambra, this is the moment. I applied for this job. My party, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APG), shortlisted me, and you, Umu nnem Ndi Anambra, interviewed and employed me with Chief Dr Onyekachukwu Gilbert Ibezim as my deputy,\u201d Soludo said.\n\n\u201cGod ordained this moment and we are grateful to Him and to you all for the privilege to serve you. Dr Ibezim and I will work very hard every day to make you proud.\u201d\n\nGovernor Soludo also praised President Muhammadu Buhari for allowing the will of the Anambra people to prevail.\n\n\u201cOur eternal gratitude goes to President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) and the presidency for remaining democrats,\u201d he said, calling for more support to deliver on his campaign promises.\n\nThe event was graced by top dignitaries in the state and beyond including the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Victor Oye and wife; Speaker of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Uchenna Okafor and wife; Sen. Victor Umeh and wife; Bianca Ojukwu, clergymen, traditional rulers among others.\n\nHours before the swearing-in, security officers were seen at strategic points within and around the Government House. Guests began to arrive for the programme in the early hours of the day and were subjected to routine security checks.\n\nA circular by the state government showed that about 50 persons were invited for the ceremony as Soludo said he wanted a low-profile event.\n\nRELATED\n\nCharles Soludo Wins Anambra Governorship Election\n\nWhy Obiano Supported Me To Become Anambra Governor \u2013 Soludo\n\nAnambra Election: I Knew Soludo Would One Day Be Governor, Says Ngige\n\nCourt Dismisses Suit Challenging Soludo\u2019s Election\n\nThursday\u2019s swearing-in is the culmination of a series of events leading to the programme. A day earlier, the former governor had handed over some state documents to the new leader.\n\nIn his farewell speech, Obiano had thanked the state for the privilege to serve, asking for forgiveness from those he may have offended. According to him, his intentions were pure even though he might have stepped on some toes.\n\nHe believes in his eight-year stint, his administration delivered on its campaign promises.\n\nSoludo\u2019s inauguration came about four months after a landslide victory in the governorship poll. The APGA flagbearer defeated his closest rival, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\u2019s Valentine Ozigbo. The Isuofia-born banker won 19 of the 21 local government areas of the state to clinch the post. He got 112,229 votes, twice higher than Ozigbo who had 53,807 votes.\n\nA month after he won the election, a Federal High Court in Abuja dismissed a suit to invalidate the victory.\n\nThe suit sought to nullify his win on allegations that Soludo provided false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo in dismissing the suit said it lacked merit and was a waste of the court\u2019s time. He told the plaintiffs not to use the court as a tool to stagnate democracy and also awarded N2 million to APGA, Soludo, and Ibezim who were the second, third, and fourth respondents in the suit. INEC was the first defendant.",

Elumelu, CON (@TonyOElumelu) March 17, 2022\n\n\u201cHow can a country so rich in natural resources have 90% of its citizens living in hardship and poverty?,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\n\u201cThis morning, I am listening to my colleagues at the office bemoan the very pressing issues that they face every day in this country, and how things have been getting worse and worse \u2013 no electricity for 5 days, hikes in the price of diesel, frightening food inflation, etc.\n\n\u201cI have often said that access to electricity is critical for our development, alleviation of poverty and hardship. And speaking of security, our people are afraid!\u201d he lamented.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Apologises To Nigerians Over Fuel Scarcity, Reacts To Blackouts\n\nSpeaking further, the entrepreneur who also runs a leading non-profit organisation, Tony Elumelu Foundation said the country is unable to meet its OPEC production quota due to oil theft.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are suffering. How can we be losing over 95% of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200k barrels of crude oil daily, instead, it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator @Shell to declare force majeure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying taxes if our security agencies can\u2019t stop this? It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple!\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, oil-producing countries are smiling as their foreign reserves rising. What is Nigeria\u2019s problem? We need to hold our leaders more accountable!\u201d\n\nConcerning the 2023 election, Elumelu urged those running for offices to prioritise security and urged Nigerians to advocate for leaders that deliver.\n\n\u201cElections are coming \u2013 security and resources need to be everyone\u2019s agenda \u2013 let\u2019s be vocal for our nation\u2019s priority.\n\n\u201cEvil prevails when good people are silent.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday apologised to Nigerians for the inconvenience caused by the prolonged shortage of petroleum products.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, he said his administration had successfully averted such a problem in its seven years in office.\n\n\u201cThe administration knows the fuel shortage has placed a strain on Nigerian citizens and businesses, but relief is on the way. I specially apologise to all sections of the society for this,\u201d said the President.\n\n\u201cThe government is working round the clock to attend to this issue. An action plan agreed earlier this month is being implemented to address the scarcity. Working together with the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), this plan is now bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cSufficient fuel supply has returned to a handful of states, with the queues at stations falling. In the coming days, we expect this to be the case across the rest of the country. Looking to the longer term, funds are being targeted toward keeping fuel availability affordable for the country.\n\n\u201cThe international energy markets have surged drastically in recent months, the government will however ensure that consumers are protected against these price spikes.\u201d\n\nThe President revealed that he has received information that some people were not behaving properly at the depots, and among owners of petrol stations.\n\nIn this regard, he directed the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and the entire security apparatus of the nation to take strong action against those responsible.\n\nImproved Power\n\nPresident Buhari also spoke about the issue of power outages witnessed recently in various parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe blackouts seen in the national grid are also being addressed,\u201d he assured Nigerians. \u201cA dip in hydroelectric generation due to seasonal pressures has coincided with technical and supply problems at thermal stations.\n\n\u201cOn this, the government is also working tirelessly to resolve the issues at the latter to guarantee sufficient power flows into the national grid.\u201d\n\nAs part of emergency measures put in place following a meeting convened with key stakeholders to address the low power generation in the country, the President said the main challenge was identified as being one of low gas power generation, as a result of sabotage of gas pipelines leading to the shutdown of power plants coupled with routine maintenance on other gas power plants.\n\nTo recover over 1000MW, he said actions were agreed upon between the players in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) and NNPC.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the actions targeted the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) plants, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), and power plants run under NNPC Joint Ventures, Agip and Shell (NAOC and SPDC).\n\nHe explained that progress on the key actions has already ensured the restoration of 375MW to the grid after the pipeline from \u201cOkpai 1\u201d was repaired.\n\nTo also ramp up the underutilised capacity of the NDPHC capacity, he said a $50 million gas supply agreement was being finalised to secure the sustainability of up to 800MW of underutilised NIPP assets.\n\nThe President assured Nigerians that the government\u2019s attention to these problems would bear fruits very soon.",

By unifying the party, we will win elections in the state chapters. By winning elections in the state chapters, collectively we will be able to put those votes together and we will definitely win the next presidential election.\n\n\u201cNigerians believe that only this party will come to power and restore the glory of Nigeria and it is on this note that I am calling on every single member of the PDP family to put their differences aside.

Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nMr Lukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nThe former PGF DG also alleged that Bello had yet to commence payment of N30,000 minimum wage as announced and that workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries.\n\nBut reacting in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, the state government said Lukman\u2019s allegations were baseless, adding that he should not \u201callow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Kogi State, Comrade Onu Edoka, has confirmed that the state government has embarked on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state, saying the Governor Yahaya Bello administration has not been owing salaries or paying 25 per cent of salaries, contrary to Lukman and other naysayers\u2019 claims.\n\nRead full statement below:\n\nBello: Your unceremonious exit as PGF DG has affected your reasoning, Kogi lambasts Lukman\n\n\u2026 as NLC debunks ousted PGF DG\u2019s claims\n\nKOGI State Government has tongue-lashed a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nLukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party.

Lukman concerning the popular presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Lukman could allow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of accusing His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni\u2019s APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more saddening that Lukman decided to expose his main fear when he unwittingly revealed that the candidate to beat in the 2023 APC primary was my principal, His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello. To the amateur politician, the unfounded allegations against the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello should sway the minds of Nigerians or party leaders.\n\n\u201cBut asking the party to prevent Yahaya Bello, a leading presidential hopeful, from getting the party\u2019s ticket, already stamps the fact that all eyes are on him to take the party to victory in the 2023 General elections, which everyone knows will be keenly contested.\n\n\u201cFor the records, Lukman\u2019s anti-party escapades while at the secretariat of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum did not only cost him his job, but also cast more ridicule on his already battered image.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, not surprised at his recent disgraceful outburst against key party leaders. He has proved himself to be a mole in APC with a mission to undermine it and ultimately hand advantage to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe, however, want to assure him that no one has the monopoly of caustic statements. Governor Yahaya Bello has only refrained from dignifying detractors with response, venom for venom, because of his sound upbringing. But if Lukman should allow frustration to take a total grip of his senses, then, he should be ready to face the consequences of his actions as we will not leave any stone unturned to seek redress legally. We will not watch him continue to rubbish the image of our dear party in the manner he has been doing.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Governor Yahaya Bello remains a key figure holding the party together and he has the support and endorsement of overwhelming majority of party faithful to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Lukman should wake up to the fact that his campaign of calumny will not wane the love APC and Nigerians have for Governor Bello.\n\n\u201cWe find it needful to inform the public that the historic and audacious staff verification exercise undertaken by the Yahaya Bello Administration at inception did not only paint the payroll in the colours of integrity and transparency, but also ensured efficiency in the service.\n\n\u201cMany unintended beneficiaries were removed and the State immediately ensured that 100% salaries were paid to the civil servants.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the staff verification exercise was carried out with the full cooperation and deep involvement of labour unions who have always cooperated with the state government in its bid to reposition and strengthen the service.\n\n\u201cNigerians are adequately informed of the meagre allocation shared during the last FAAC meeting. Many states have yet to pay their February salary.\n\n\u201cInternally generated revenue wasn\u2019t at the standard our administration had set as a result of economic downturn, owing to the energy crisis that hit the nation in February.\n\nBut as an administration that is committed to the welfare of the civil servants, the Kogi State Government sat with labour leaders and agreed to pay 75%.\n\n\u201cIt has since been paid with the full implementation of the minimum wage. This is against the lies peddled by Lukman that Kogi workers received 25 percentage of their old salaries.\n\n\u201cOnly civil servants on grade level 7 and above received 75%. Civil servants on Grade Level 1 to 6 received 100% salary with the 30,000 minimum wage. The Governor and all political office holders also received 75% in solidarity with our workforce. To us, this is responsible and responsive leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate the commitment of the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello\u2019s administration towards the welfare of the workforce and that no amount of lies sponsored by Lukman will prevent Governor Bello from answering the popular call by the Nigerian masses to serve the nation in the presidential capacity,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "International outrage over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine grew on Thursday as U.S. and Ukrainian officials said civilians waiting in line for bread and sheltering in a theater had been killed by Russian forces.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a war criminal in comments the Kremlin said were \u201cunforgivable\u201d as it insisted the war in Ukraine was \u201cgoing to plan\u201d amid talk of compromise at peace talks.\n\nMoscow has yet to capture any of Ukraine\u2019s biggest cities despite the largest assault on a European state since World War Two. More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and thousands have died as the war enters its fourth week.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign ministry said Russian forces dropped a powerful bomb on a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, leaving many civilians trapped and an unknown number of casualties. Reuters could not independently verify the information.\n\nMaxar Technologies, a private U.S. company, distributed satellite imagery it said was collected on March 14 and showed the word \u201cchildren\u201d in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed building.\n\nThe theater had been housing at least 500 civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cThis raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water, and heating have been almost completely cut off,\u201d Belkis Wille from the rights group said.\n\nMoscow denies targeting civilians and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said its forces had not struck the building, RIA news agency said.\n\nThirteen buses carrying around 300 refugees from Mariupol have arrived in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency cited the Russian defense ministry as saying on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 top court for disputes between states ordered Russia on Wednesday to immediately halt its military operations in Ukraine, saying it was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d by Moscow\u2019s use of force.\n\n\u2018NEUTRAL STATUS\u2019\n\nUkraine\u2019s armed forces are conducting small-scale counter attacks on several fronts and Russian troops have not been able to gain ground because of a lack of resources, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Wednesday.\n\nThere were signs of compromise and progress at ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance.\n\n\u201cNeutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. \u201cThere are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.\u201d\n\nVladimir Medinsky, Russia\u2019s chief negotiator, told state TV: \u201cUkraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarized state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.\u201d\n\nAustria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia\u2019s primary concerns.\n\n\u201cMy priorities during the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, guarantees of security, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country,\u201d Zelensky said in a video address released early on Thursday.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday to the U.S. Congress by video link, Zelensky repeated a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West won\u2019t introduce.\n\n\u201cIn the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones, anti-armor and anti-aircraft systems.\n\n\u201cMore will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that \u2026 we are ready to transfer,\u201d Biden said, later condemning Putin.\n\n\u201cHe is a war criminal,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nNATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels also pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of troops.",

          "text": "Chris Cuomo wants an arbitrator to award him $125 million for his firing from CNN, alleging his bosses knew full well how he advised his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and suggested they did the same themselves.\n\nHis filing seeking arbitration on Wednesday exposed more ugliness at the network, where Cuomo, CNN chief Jeff Zucker and his top deputy, Allison Gollust, have all been ousted in the past three months.\n\nZucker fired Cuomo, host of the network\u2019s most popular prime time show, in December after a New York Attorney General\u2019s report publicly revealed new details about how he helped his brother strategize to fight sexual harassment allegations.\n\n\u201cIt should be obvious by now that Chris Cuomo did not lie to CNN about helping his brother,\u201d said his lawyer, Bryan Freedman. \u201cIn fact, as the limited information released from Warner Media\u2019s investigation makes clear, CNN\u2019s highest-level executives not only knew about Chris\u2019 involvement in helping his brother but also actively assisted the governor, both through Chris and directly themselves.\u201d\n\nThere was no comment Wednesday from a representative for Zucker and Gollust. The spokeswoman, Risa Heller, has denied in the past that Gollust, a former press aide to Gov. Cuomo, offered advice or counsel to the governor while she worked at CNN.\n\nCNN declined comment on the filing.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Chris Cuomo interviewed his big brother on CNN nine times \u2014 a temporary lift of the network\u2019s policy that Chris Cuomo not participate in stories concerning the governor.\n\nIn his filing Wednesday, Chris Cuomo said CNN leadership demanded the interviews even though he and his brother had expressed reservations about them.\n\nHe said that Zucker and Gollust tried to strengthen the network\u2019s ties to his brother and pushed the New York governor not to appear on other networks. He said they requested the governor hold his daily briefings at a time CNN\u2019s ratings needed a boost.\n\n\u201cNetwork standards were changed in a calculated decision to boost ratings,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cWhen those practices were called into question, Chris was made the scapegoat.\u201d\n\nCuomo also dragged two former colleagues into his complaint, saying Don Lemon and Jake Tapper were never disciplined for incidents seen as ethical lapses \u2014 Lemon texting Jussie Smollett when the actor was accused of making false allegations of a racist attack, and Tapper allegedly offering advice to a politician.\n\nNetworks standards were \u201ca moving target,\u201d modified as Zucker and Gollust saw fit, the former \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d host said in the complaint.\n\nWith his journalistic integrity \u201cunjustifiably smeared,\u201d Cuomo will find it difficult to find work in his field in the future and seeks damages of $125 million, the complaint said.\n\nZucker resigned under pressure earlier this year after it was revealed he violated corporate practices by not disclosing his romance with Gollust.

          "text": "Three Metropolitan Police constables are under investigation for misconduct over their roles in either conducting or supervising the strip-search of a Black schoolgirl.\n\nThe student, known as Child Q, was subjected to \u201ctraumatic\u201d degradation by officers while on her period after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis, according to a safeguarding report which also found that racism \u201clikely played a factor\u201d. She was forced to spread her legs, use her hands to spread her buttock cheeks, and cough.\n\nStaff members at her Hackney-based secondary school called the police after falsely alleging drug possession; the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched a probe in the matter following a mandatory referral by the Met in May 2021.\n\nThe watchdog\u2019s investigation is now being finalised and a decision regarding the officers is pending.\n\nIOPC Regional Director Sal Naseem said: \u201cWe recognise the seriousness of this case and the concern it has caused in the community following the publication of the Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review into this incident.\n\n\u201cWe have now completed all lines of inquiry for our investigation and we are close to finalising our report. We will look to conclude decision making around that at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has examined whether legislation, policies and procedures were followed during the strip search of the girl and we have looked at complaints that the girl\u2019s mother was not given the opportunity to be present during the strip search, and that there was no other appropriate adult present. We have also considered whether the girl\u2019s ethnicity played a part in the officers\u2019 decision to strip search the girl.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the impact on the secondary school pupil \u2013 referred to as Child Q \u2013 was \u201cprofound\u201d and the repercussions \u201cobvious and ongoing\u201d.\n\nFamily members described her as changing from a \u201chappy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks\u201d, who now self-harms and needs therapy.\n\nSchool staff had wrongly accused the girl of possession of cannabis months before and, despite their mistake, hypothetically threatened the child and her mother with the prospect of expulsion, in this manner: \u201cIf she is found with weed/drugs on her she will not be able to continue her place with [the school]\u201d.\n\nThe basis for the school\u2019s initial allegation was that Child Q appeared to be \u201cintoxicated\u201d, which, her mother explained, was because she\u2019d been up until late the night before studying. They also expressed concern about cannabis possession because another student, known to the girl, was excluded for drug possession months before.\n\nScotland Yard has apologised and said the incident \u201cshould never have happened\u201d.\n\nCouncillor Anntoinette Bramble, deputy mayor and cabinet member for Hackney Council\u2019s Children\u2019s Services, and the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said they were \u201cappalled\u201d by all aspects of the review.\n\nThey have asked for a report in six to nine months on progress made regarding the review\u2019s eight findings and 14 recommendations.\n\nThese include calls for the Department for Education to make more explicit reference to safeguarding in its guidance on searching, screening and confiscation, and for police guidance on strip-searching children to clearly outline the need for a focus on safeguarding.\n\nThe review found that school staff deferred to the police\u2019s authority and \u201cshould have been more challenging\u201d and all staff members involved remain in post, The Independent understands.\n\nCondemnation of the school and police has been swift from concerned members of the public, campaigners and politicians.\n\nA Black Lives Matter UK spokesperson said the review\u2019s recommendations will not prevent similar incidents happening again.\n\n\u201cIt is a consistent practice of the police to violate and assault Black people \u2013 including Black children. This is their modus operandi,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe horrific strip search of a Black girl at school is a clear example of why police should not be in places of education. While politicians have recently called for more police officers to be stationed in schools across the capital, children are being traumatised in spaces that should be safe,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWith each story of degradation and brutality towards Black people at the hands of police, our resolve to abolish this violent institution only becomes stronger. Abolition makes the case for itself.\u201d\n\nEbinehita Iyere, founder of Milk Honey Bees, told The Independent: \u201cFrom a structural level, Black girls are being let down. They are criminalised through the British education system and the case of Child Q has further amplified that reality.\n\n\u201cMany Black girls will read, hear or have experienced things similar to her case. For too long, they have been overlooked and erased by state institutions, creating a situation that renders their childhood as invisible, further adultifying and exposing them to harm. Through Milk Honey Bees, I help to create a safe, nurturing space for our girls.\n\n\u201cSociety must listen to and protect Black girls. We need to create change within our systems, but this means that Black girls need to be on every agenda to ensure the erasure that has taken place is eradicated.\u201d\n\nAfrican, Caribbean and Asian Lawyers 4 Justice, a campaigning group of lawyers and judicial experts, said that Child Q\u2019s family may wish to consider a number of legal courses of action for equalities, safeguarding and human rights breaches, for example under Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThere may be grounds for a civil claim against the police and potentially Judicial Review regarding action on the school and local authority for unlawful actions, they added.\n\nZita Holbourne of the collective told The Independent: \u201cOur thoughts are with Child Q and their family and we send our solidarity for justice and healing from the trauma experienced.\n\n\u201cThis situation is horrific on multiple grounds and a number of institutions are answerable and accountable including the police, school, local authority and the Department of Education.\u201d",

          "text": "A clinical Liverpool beat Arsenal 2-0 to cut Manchester City\u2019s once double-digit lead at the top of the Premier League table to a single point on Wednesday, leaving the title race wide open.\n\nAn Arsenal side on a five-game winning run in the league and in fourth place represented a big obstacle to Klopp\u2019s title chasers and were the better side in the first half.\n\nBut the game tipped decisively early in a frenetic second period as Liverpool extended their own relentless run to nine consecutive league wins.\n\nTheir breakthrough came shortly after a misplaced backpass had almost gifted Arsenal a goal, Portuguese Diogo Jota getting ahead of the London side\u2019s defence on 54 minutes to beat goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale at his near post.\n\nRoberto Firmino sewed up a crucial three points eight minutes later, squeezing a shot under the Arsenal goalkeeper again after the hosts had twice failed to clear the ball.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s title destiny is now very much in their own hands as they still have to visit City in April.\n\nManager Juergen Klopp celebrated with the visiting fans at the end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously had a good period. It\u2019s what we need. We\u2019re one point (behind), but it\u2019s still the same. We have to win football matches. We then face City, then all the others.\n\n\u201cHopefully all the players come back fit from international duty. Then we have an early kickoff against Watford. It\u2019s better to be one point behind than 14 points.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a special group here and we\u2019re trying to squeeze everything we can out of the situation.\u201d\n\nWhile the result was a blow to Arsenal they remain fourth in the table, one point above Manchester United having played two games fewer.\n\n\u201cThey really raised the level today but unfortunately games are won in the boxes,\u201d he said of his side. \u201cWe opened the door and they went to that door and scored two goals.\u201d\n\nArsenal more than matched Liverpool for long periods but the game ultimately swung shortly after the interval.\n\nA misplaced backpass by Thiago let in Martin Odegaard who looked poised to score but Alisson made a superb save.\n\nMinutes later Jota fired the visitors ahead to knock the stuffing out of the hosts.\n\nFirmino, who came off the bench along with Mohamed Salah who surprisingly did not start, then produced a neat flick to convert Andy Robertson\u2019s cross after Arsenal were guilty of not getting the ball clear on several occasions.\n\n\u201cI saw a hard-working team in the first half and in the second half we enjoyed it more and that was when we really stepped up,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe really want to enjoy the situation we are in by winning football matches.\u201d",
