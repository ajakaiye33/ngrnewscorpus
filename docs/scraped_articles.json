          "text": "24 hours after the Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party asked the state governor, Hope Uzodinma, to resign over rising insecurity in the state, the state government had said that the main opposition had indicted itself over the security situation of the state.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said that the statement credited to PDP was a self-indictment on their part.\n\nEmelumba said that by that utterance, PDP had admitted responsibility for insecurity challenges in the state.\n\nEmelumba recalled that right from the inception of the administration, of Hope Uzodimma, the PDP leaders, particularly a former Deputy Governor, Gerald Irona, had vowed to make the state ungovernable if they failed to get the review of the Supreme Court judgement on the governorship election in their favour.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was all over the social media, where the party leadership made this threat which was even on video, and it was never denied nor retracted. The PDP has been on a mission to actualising it evidenced by the organised protests they staged in the early stages of the Uzodimma administration.\n\nRead Also\n\n\u201cThe PDP never condemned the attacks on the correctional centre, the burnings of police stations and killings in the state, showing that they condoned the attacks.\n\n\u201cPDP is condoning these attacks because it seems like they are playing a script and are very happy that they have reached the climax that is why they are issuing very illogical and unreasonable demands.\u201d\n\nResponding, the PDP spokesperson in the state, Ogubundu Nwadike, said that the APC led government in the state had failed.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to join issues with a government that has failed in its primary duty of securing lives and property. Imo government should seek help on what is happening here. We insist that the governor should resign for incompetence.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kennedy Mbele\n\nVice President of South-East South-South Professionals of Nigeria, SESSPN, Mr. Andy Wabali, in this interview, explains the association\u2019s determination to make both regions an economic hub irrespective of emerging security challenges.\n\nEver since the South-East South-South Professionals of Nigeria, SESSPN, came up with Development Agenda 2035, DASESS, nothing has been heard about it. What is happening?\n\nI can tell you that a lot has happened since then. There were summits in Port Harcourt and Enugu. Yes, the tempo slowed down but now there is a re-awakening.\n\nWhat informed the adoption of the agenda?\n\nThe ethno \u2013 political complexities surrounding apportionments and developments in Nigeria have always necessitated the adoption of some measures. That is the reason for the regional perspective to the development of the various regions. In addition to this, the current low crude oil prices and the realisation of the need for economic diversification, make it even more critical to decentralize economic planning and development strategies. Planning around the zones rather than individual states can afford numerous synergies, which would be difficult to achieve if each state were to plan for its economic future alone.\n\nAlso, the rising inequalities and competition among Nigeria\u2019s geopolitical regions, have shown that any region that does not raise its game will soon be left behind due largely to urbanization and rising unemployment. On the global side, the increasing globalization, increased mobility of capital, labour and ideas, have led to these key resources seeking out only the best place. Only regions or localities that position appropriately can achieve swift development from the influx of these resources.\n\nThe increasing calls for devolution of power from the central government to levels, present an opportunity to drive growth and development. It is only a detailed development blueprint that would ensure that development proceeds in an organized fashion.\n\nDASESS 2035 looks very holistic but more futuristic\u2026\n\nYes, it is more futuristic. We are planning for the future. Of course, the future is now. The overall vision of DASESS 2035 is to make the South East / South-South region of Nigeria the most prosperous and globally competitive region with emerging economies in the next 20years. We are talking of emerging economies like Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, India, and South Africa among others. We want to compete with these countries. The question is: can we? Of course, we can. We had a better GDP than these countries in the \u201960s as a region. With a population of over 50 million people, we want to ensure the actualization of a sustainable regional competitive advantage by prioritizing key shared values like innovativeness, integrity, hard work, entrepreneurship, education, technology and creativity. Generally, it is to make the regions where you can live, work and play.\n\nIn the light of current security challenges in both regions, is it right for SESSPN to be talking of the development agenda?\n\nOf course, there is no right time but now to talk about DASESS 2035. DASESS 2035 is a blueprint that encapsulates solutions. We need an enabling environment for development. Without the right environment, there will be no development. Security is an important enabler for development. Like I said earlier, the overall vision is to make the regions a place where you can live, work and play far ahead of Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, Morocco and South Africa.\n\nAs the Vice President of SESSPN, to what extent has the group been involved in the search for solutions to the emerging security challenges in the zones?\n\nUntil recently, you will agree with me that the regions had been very safe. The burning of police stations and killing of policemen in the region are new developments. However, we condemn such acts and are fully in support of measures that would restore peace and stop the further breakdown of law and order in the region. Justice should also be brought to all perpetrators of criminality in the region.\n\nOne of the key issues often discussed when talking about economic revitalization of the regions is the need for the revamping of eastern ports in Rivers, Delta, Cross River and Anambra states. What role is SESSPN playing to ensure it becomes a reality?\n\nAs a group, we engaged the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, on the issue in October last year. He assured us of the revitalization of the eastern ports and railways to operate at full capacity. He announced the building of two new deep seaports in the region by the federal government. They include the Bonny Deep Seaport and the Warri Sea Port. Also, at the meeting, he reiterated government\u2019s commitment to ensure the Gulf of Guinea is safe.

          "text": "Following the suspension of the microblogging platform, Twitter by the Federal Government on Friday, experts have revealed that the already \u2018dangling\u2019 economy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will suffer more setbacks.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the FG through the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Friday announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter over alleged \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d.\n\nBut the government later referred to the suspension as temporary.\n\nUK states position on suspension of Twitter in Nigeria\n\nThe shocking news which dropped on Friday evening devastated all social media platforms as it was rumoured that the suspension will include Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and others as Nigerians raged and reprimanded the president and his advisers for taking such a decision.\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s decision to cripple the activities of social media users was not unconnected to the recent outrage by Nigerians over President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s alleged threat against the Southeast people.\n\nBuhari had on Tuesday, June 1, while receiving a briefing from the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, threatened to clampdown on some elements in the Southeast for allegedly destroying government facilities in the region.\n\nAccording to him, attacks on security operatives and government facilities in the region were sponsored by his rivals who desperately want his government to fail, stressing that they will soon receive the shock of their lives. He equally referred to the 30 months\u2019 civil war in the country, saying that young people causing trouble in the Southeast were not born then, threatening to respond in the \u201clanguage they understand.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comment stimulated relatively uncontrollable indignation on social media on Wednesday by concerned Nigerians including some political heavyweights who attacked the Nigerian leader for threatening war against those he was elected to protect.\n\nBan: Twitter states next line of action\n\nFollowing the outrageous tweets on Wednesday by some Nigerians, management of Twitter deleted the president\u2019s controversial tweet, arousing more reactions from Nigerian citizens as many lauded the platform over the deletion while the president\u2019s supporters slammed the platform, accusing it of playing double standards\n\nSome Nigerians who spoke with DAILY POST correspondent lamented the negative effects the Twitter suspension would have on average Nigerians particularly the youths who depend on the platform for their survival, citing the employment crisis hitherto rocking the nation.\n\nRecall that the unemployment rate in Nigeria jumped from 4.31% in 2015 to 7.96% in 2020. Meanwhile, the recent surge in insecurity across the country has also made several Nigerians, particularly farmers and traders jobless due to the activities of bandits, Boko Haram insurgents, herdsmen and unknown gunmen.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Onion Producers and Marketers Association (OPMAN) announced its decision to suspend the supply of onions to the southeast owing to insecurity, stating that truckloads of their goods were recently hijacked by unknown gunmen.\n\nFarmers and traders may have been robbed of their jobs by the ravaging security crisis.\n\nDAILY POST reports that following the menace of endless job search in the country, some Nigerians have resorted to online business where they buy and sell products using social media platforms particularly the suspended microblogging platform, Twitter to market their products.\n\nA user, Margret Femi who spoke with our correspondent in Abuja, said she used the medium (Twitter) to market her fashion, a petty business she established to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cSince I started my fashion business in 2019 after my one-year compulsory service, I have been making sales using Twitter.\n\n\u201cI could have used other platforms like Facebook but we meet our targeted customers on Twitter and most customers believe in information on it than any other medium.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should give us a job or restore the platform with immediate effect. It is not a crime to be born in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have been searching for a job everywhere and it seems like to be employed in this country, you must come from a rich home or a family of a politician. We have been helping ourselves. They should not force out the best in us\u201d, she said.\n\nSimilarly, a talented singer who simply identified himself as Wiz Money, said he and other up and coming artists used the platform to promote their tracks, stating that it was easier to meet superstars via the medium.\n\n\u201cWhenever we drop a fresh track, we usually tweet the link and tag some superstars with the hope that one day we shall be noticed.\n\n\u201cBesides that, I have over two thousand followers on Twitter so I also use it to advertise products for whoever needs it. That is how we get the money to push ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThousands of Nigerians employed by different private organisations to manage their firms\u2019 Twitter handle may soon be relieved of their jobs following the ban on the platform by the Federal Government.\n\nAn economic expert, James Adoga who spoke with DAILY POST correspondent from Lagos State, identified some areas the FG\u2019s move may affect the economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSocial media as a whole, is a new buzz in the area of marketing which includes small businesses, organisations and brands, helping them to create news, make friends, connections and followers.\n\n\u201cThe world has gone digital and the market is also gradually moving from the usual physical gatherings to the buying and selling that happens via the social media such as the suspended Twitter.\n\n\u201cSome private organisations such as the telecommunication industries and banks, use social media to enhance the performance of their firms in various ways such as accomplishing business objectives through increment in annual profits from sales and services.\n\n\u201cIt provides stands as a communication platform that facilitates two ways communication between the company and their stockholders.\n\n\u201cMany businesses in the country have been promoted via a social medium like the suspended Twitter. Many organisations achieve this by giving advertisement on the platform to attract maximum users or customers.\n\n\u201cThrough this medium, customers can connect and interact with their suppliers without transport fare. So the importance of the medium to the Nigerian economy cannot be overemphasised considering the numerous benefits it has on individuals.\n\n\u201cFollowing the ban on Twitter, the performance of many companies will drop and several persons will join the group of unemployed youths\u201d.\n\nAnother expert, Mr Onome Akogba said the suspension may further worsen the already deteriorating security situation across the country.\n\nAccording to him, the medium has helped in keeping most jobless youths busy, stating that shutting it down may force them into the street, posing more threats to security of lives and property.\n\nHe added that police and other security operatives have always received security alerts from the medium which enhance prompt actions against the criminal elements.\n\n\u201cSocial media makes it easier to disseminate activities of criminals whenever it occurs as all you need to do is just click a button and the security operative will swiftly respond. This has saved many lives in the past.\n\n\u201cI can tell you without any fear that banning Twitter from operating in the country will worsen the crisis which has spread across the country\u201d.\n\nHowever, against the earlier announcement by Lai Mohammed, that the platform was suspended indefinitely, the presidency on Saturday said the suspension of the microblogging platform, was temporary.\n\nIn a statement issued by Buhari\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, the presidency said the move to suspend the platform was not triggered by only the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nAccording to Garba, Twitter had permitted misinformation and fake news threatening the corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to the loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart\u201d, Garba added.\n\nBut experts are of the opinion that the Nigerian government failed to look at the negative effects of the ban as many influencers on the platform and others who depend on Twitter campaigns for survival would be hit hard by the ban. According to them, the already deteriorating economy will further suffer for it and unemployment rate will shoot up.\n\nDefection: Why our Governors are joining APC \u2013 PDP",

          "text": "By Robert Egbe\n\nLagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) Chief pathologist, Dr John Obafunwa, on Saturday told the Lagos State Judicial Panel probing police brutality that it received three corpses said to be from the Lekki Tollgate incident of October 20, 2020.\n\nObafunwa told the panel that the trio was part of the 99 corpses that the hospital received from different parts of Lagos and on which it did autopsies during and after the #EndSARS protest.\n\nThe Professor of Medicine, anatomic and forensic pathologist as well as Head of Department, Morbid Anatomy at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital College of Medicine (LASUTHCOM), said the 99 corpses were recorded between October 19 and 24, 2020.\n\nObafunwa\u2019s testimony followed his invitation by the panel chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi (rtd) to assist the panel in its investigation of the Lekki Tollgate incident.\n\nNo fewer than 14 petitioners have accused the Nigerian Army and Policemen of shooting several protesters dead and injuring several others during the #EndSARS protests against police brutality.\n\nThe army, which entered a defence denying the allegation, failed to honour subsequent summons requiring it to respond to further questions by petitioners.\n\nObafunwa spoke while being cross-examined by some of the #EndSARS protesters\u2019 counsel, Mr Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika, SAN.\n\nHe presented the autopsy reports and pictures of three bodies from Lekki to the panel, showing different degrees of injuries.\n\n\u201cThose are the three bodies I was told were from Lekki as recorded by the people who brought them in,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Fusika disputed the testimony, arguing that the number of dead protesters from Lekki was higher.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to prove to this panel that the claim that only three dead bodies were brought in from Lekki is not true.\u201d\n\nFusika requested that the Chief Coroner be ordered to produce records of the 99 cases to the panel, including autopsy reports.\n\n\u201cSince he was told that only those three are from Lekki, he might have been told the wrong thing,\u201d Fusika added.\n\nBut Obafunwa explained that the bodies were deposited by the Lagos State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (SEHMU), an agency in charge of recovering dead bodies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go about scavenging for dead bodies. It is when they are brought in that we are told and it is recorded where they were taken from,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Chief Pathologist said according to their records, the bodies were recovered from different parts of Lagos including Ikorodu, Lagos Mainland, Yaba, Mushin and others.\n\nGranting his request, Justice Okuwobi ruled that the chief pathologist should produce the records at the next adjourned date.\n\nHowever, she said autopsy reports would not be required as that would expand the work of the panel beyond the terms of reference.\n\nThe matter was adjourned till June 19.",

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\nIn furtherance of commitment to delivering optimally on its strategic mandate as the catalyst for driving social and physical infrastructure development through public and private sector collaboration, the Lagos State Office of the Public Private Partnership held a three-day retreat for its staff with a view to deepening their knowledge of the core mandate of the PPP Office.\n\nThe retreat, which was held recently at Park Inn by Radisson Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, was attended by staff of the PPP Office across all cadres, and it was resourced by experts and policy makers drawn from diverse fields and expertise in public-private partnership, infrastructure development, legislature, legal, finance and integrated marketing communications, among others.\n\nThemed \u2018Private Sector Collaboration: A service-driven culture for enhanced infrastructural delivery\u2019, the knowledge-share retreat also sought to empower the staff by exposing them to issues, challenges and opportunities, and current realities in the implementation of public-private partnership projects.\n\nWelcoming the participants, the Director-General of Public Private Partnership, Mr. Ope George, said the key objective of the retreat was to provide a platform for the participants to refresh their mind, broaden their knowledge generally, and upscale their skill set.\n\nHe added that it was also designed to prepare them adequately for greater impact in the discharge of the PPP\u2019s strategic mandate, stressing that the PPP Office is pivotal and very crucial to the accomplishment of the goals of the T.H.E.M.E.S. agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration.\n\nRead Also: Lagos dislodges 10 illegal slaughter slabs\n\n\u201cWe are key custodians of the T.H.E.M.E.S. agenda of the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; our role is very strategic. So, in order to effectively deliver on this important role, we have put this retreat together to retool everyone of us for optimal performance in our respective role within the value chain,\u2019\u2019 George said.\n\nChairman, House Committee on PPP, Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Lukmon Olumoh, also in attendance, commended the Director-General for the quality of resource persons, as it underscores his vision to position PPP as a force to reckon with, in the efforts to build a greater Lagos through infrastructure renewal and upgrade. He went further to emphasize that it is imperative to review the Lagos State PPP Law (2011) to properly create a more robust and enabling legal and regulatory framework for viable and bankable projects.\n\nSpeaking on the topic, \u2018Concessions: Regulating and monitoring compliance of terms and conditions of projects against market externalities\u2019, Managing Partner/CEO, G A Capital Ltd, Mr. Ayo Gbeleyi, emphasised that establishing a framework is germane to a successful PPP programme which can only be achieved where there is political will, consistency and continuity in project plan, integration and collaboration among all relevant stakeholders, clear assigned roles and responsibility, and high breed of opportunities for investors.\n\nHe added that the procurement process for any PPP programme must also be smooth and straightened by ensuring that stakeholders are well informed of the breadth and depth of projects, and clear about indemnities and guarantees through refining the legal and regulatory frameworks to align with best practices.\n\nMr. Gbeleyi, who is also a former Lagos State Commissioner for Finance and former Special Adviser to the Governor on PPP, further noted that a well-motivated workforce is imperative to deliver good results on PPP projects.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2018Building the capacity of the workforce is pertinent to achieving a progressive PPP and creating avenues of career opportunity and development while ensuring efficiency. Also, the morale of personnel must be boosted to get results,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nAnother highpoint of the retreat was a panel discussion on the topic, \u2018Vision Building for a Greater Lagos\u2019, featuring the State Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Bisola Olusanya; State Commissioner for Economic, Planning and Budget, Mr. Sam Egube; Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Governmental Affairs, Hon. Oloye Akin Alabi; and Group Chief Executive Officer, The Temple Management Company, Mr. Idris Olorunnimbe, while the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Administration, Mrs. Titilayo Oshodi, moderated.\n\nOlusanya acknowledged the importance of PPP in the attainment of the goal of food sufficiency in the state, disclosing that the state government had drawn up a PPP-driven strategic five-year agricultural road map. \u2018\u2018Lagos will not be able to produce all the food that is required, we need to collaborate with other states and the private sector to realise this initiative,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOn his part, Egube suggested that for PPP to key into the vision of the state to become Africa\u2019s model megacity, global economic and financial hub, there is need to organise all the processes and procedures of government businesses and disengage businesses that are not strategic and productive.\n\nHe further urged that, \u2018\u2018PPP needs to create partnership across all board because the quality of T.H.E.M.E Lagos should be a leading light and the entire workforce must build their proficiency through training and re-training.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile sharing the success story about his lottery and gaming business, Hon. Alabi, who is also the CEO, Nairabet, commended Lagos State for being the only state that has made a giant stride in the regulatory framework for partnership in the lottery business.\n\nHe emphasised, however, the need to deeply interrogate government processes and expand its regulations, ensure consistency in government policies and build trust in the private sector so that more investors can come in.\n\nOlorunnimbe, on his part, said there was a need to reinforce building \u2018Greater Lagos\u2019 dream by everyone telling positive stories about Lagos to encourage and promote excellence in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe stated: \u2018\u2018There is a need to go back to the basics, social re-engineering, showcase the resilience in the people of Lagos, about greater Lagos and harness the potentials in the youth. I believe we can achieve a lot through entertainment, and music is one of the veritable platforms to communicate the stories about Lagos to the people and the world as a whole.\u2019\u2019\n\nA marketing communications expert and Chief Executive Officer, DKK Nigeria, Mrs. Tope Jemerigbe, in her presentation titled, \u2018Communication: Engaging the private sector for participation in infrastructural development\u2019, stressed that communication plays a crucial role in infrastructure development because it is an important tool to bridge the gap and to influence relevant stakeholders to achieve the expected outcome from them.\n\nShe urged the participants to constantly identify and engage the stakeholders to achieve results by ensuring that communication is well targeted and adapted to specific groups.\n\nDeputy Director, Administration and Human Resource, Public Service Office of the Office of the Head of Service, Mr. Kayode Ogbe, who spoke on \u2018Public Service Rules: A benchmark for quality service delivery\u2019, emphasised that adherence to set rules, processes and procedures, as well as employees conduct is pivotal to delivering good outcomes in PPP programmes.\n\n\u2018\u2018Without rules, clear processes and procedures, employees conduct within an organization would be chaotic,\u2019\u2019 he stated.",

Now, I have moved on from there to TV presenting.\n\nTell us about your growing up?\n\nMy mum is an academic, an educator. It\u2019s from her I got my flair for education. My dad is an entrepreneur, but he is retired now. They are very instrumental in terms of discipline and values I portray as a lady. I\u2019m very proud of my discipline, I mean in terms of values, they were very keen in support of me. This venture of going into Big Brother after graduation as an engineer was very offline. They didn\u2019t understand it, but they understood the daughter they raised, they trusted their handwork. I made the point not to disappoint them and I\u2019m working so hard to let them know I\u2019m not practicing as an engineer, but I\u2019m making as much in bank as engineers will.\n\nWhat\u2019s your new TV programme all about?\n\nI am the host of Jollof TV show produced by Zikel Cosmetics. Zikel birthed the idea and they approached me to be a part of it. The show has started airing on WAPTV, DSTV, GOTV, StarTimes and some terrestrial stations from the first Friday in May. Basically, Jollof Show is about having interactions with your favourite celebrities. The show is not just about coming to have fun; we also get to learn a few things about lifestyle, fitness, grooming, working-out, and use of slimming teas. So, it\u2019s just about coming together and having a beautiful blend of spices like we have in jollof rice. The show has something for everyone. The context of what jollof means is what we are applying on the show.\n\nWhen you are not hosting a show, what else do you do?\n\nI\u2019m a spice of everything, just like jollof rice. I\u2019m a chemical engineer, an entrepreneur; I try my hands on different business ventures. You will be hearing new things about me soon.\n\nHow do you take time off to relax?\n\nThere\u2019s no relaxation on empty bank account. I believe now is the time to work. I am young, I am still energetic and I have this opportunity now, so why don\u2019t I work? Relaxation will come when I\u2019m sitting on my billion.\n\nHow did you cope with the lockdown?\n\nI was praying for Nigeria. I was praying not to catch Coronavirus. The world was standing still and I was part of the world standing still. I was learning new things online, taking few courses, and getting my post-graduate online.\n\nTell us about your romantic side, do you have any man in your life yet?\n\nI\u2019m not in a rush. Whoever comes I will just go with the flow. No pressure right now, if he comes, he comes; if he doesn\u2019t come, he doesn\u2019t come, bye! As much as everyone is telling me how old I am (for marriage), my thought is telling me how broke I am. No pressure to do anything.\n\nWhat is your kind of man?\n\nHe must have two legs; have two hands, but must have sense. That is the most important part I can\u2019t compromise. He can have one leg, but must have sense. That is very key to me. I\u2019m not looking for anything in particular; I will just know if my spirit can go with this person. I don\u2019t have a checklist.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young people?\n\nDo not wait on anything to be handed to you. As much as the government and other people owe you things, don\u2019t bank on that. The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, so go there and take it by force. Be ready to face disappointments. Don\u2019t get away by the things on social media. As a young person, half of what you see on social media is fake. So, do not compare your chapter one to another person\u2019s chapter 16. Nobody posts his or her failures on Instagram. Be patient with yourself, work as hard as you can. If you are a person of faith, don\u2019t forget that and when you get there, don\u2019t forget that faith too. Just be a good human being.",

          "title": "Unknown gunmen: Blood flows in Southeast",
          "text": "From George Onyejiuwa, Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri), Okey Sampson (Umuahia), Obinna Odogwu (Awka) and Magnus Eze (Enugu)\n\nThe whole of Southeast and parts of South-south geo-political zones have come under severe attacks since early this year by some faceless people popularly referred to as \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d. Public infrastructure, especially facilities of the police, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and others have become the prime target of this group just as several security personnel had lost their lives.\n\nThe situation has continued to generate palpable tension and fear in the two regions of the country particularly as the Federal Government commenced deployment of more military assets, including troops, intelligence personnel and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to the disturbed areas.\n\nWhile the government blamed the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and its security arm, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), for the atrocities, the group has continued to distance itself from any complicity.\n\nInnocent people have fallen victims in the hands of the so-called unknown gunmen, but the more worrisome issue is the military occupation of many towns and roads in the Southeast, including inter-state roads.\n\nThe current clampdown on pro-Biafra groups and suspected \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 has practically crippled economic activities and movements in these areas.\n\nIn fact, the matter seemingly got to a head recently as President Muhammadu Buhari took to his Twitter handle to send a stern warning to those, he said, were bent on dismembering Nigeria, threatening to deal ruthlessly with the people of Southeast in the his widely criticized tweet.\n\nHis threat has, however, not restrained the armed groups, who killed policemen as well as burnt police stations and correctional facilities in Imo, Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Akwa Ibom and Rivers states.\n\nAs the security forces combed Imo communities in search of members of the IPOB and its vigilante outfit, ESN, Kanayo Nwokike (Ikonso), said to be commander of the vigilante, was recently \u2018neutralized\u2019 by security forces in his community, Awomamma in Oru East council of Imo State. Joint-security operations have also continued in the Orlu axis of the state.\n\nHarvest of deaths in Imo\n\nThese operations have raised issue of extra-judicial killings as was alleged in the case of Awurum Eze, who troops allegedly burnt down his home in Mbano, after tagging him the second-in-command to the slain Ikonso. Eze was eventually arrested in Aba, Abia State.\n\nSunday Sun gathered that the security situation in Imo State recently took a more frightening dimension with the killing of Ahmed Gulak, a former political adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan, in Owerri.\n\nUnconfirmed reports put the number of innocent victims in the state, so far, at over 100, as the special forces of the Military/Police deployed to the state have continued in their battle against ESN/IPOB agitators and the \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d in Imo.\n\nThe deteriorating security situation has also forced prominent citizens in the state to go underground, even as top state government functionaries no longer use their official vehicles after official hours for fear of being attacked by gunmen after an attack on the Commissioner for Entrepreneurship and Skills Acquisition, Ike Umeh, at Orji on April 12, 2021.\n\nWhile many innocent people especially the youths had fallen victims either to stray bullet or teargas shots fired at them by the security agents, hundreds of Imo youths are also being arrested and detained by the police for allegedly being members of IPOB/ ESN.\n\nOne of such heart-rending cases was on Friday May 28, at the Nekede/Naze Junction along the Owerri \u2013 Aba road where Nigeria Air Force personnel allegedly opened fire on motorists and passers-by over the death of one of their colleagues in the hands of gunmen. Five innocent persons were in the process allegedly shot dead, while several others got varying degrees of injuries as they scampered for safety.\n\nOn the Monday May 31, Germany-based Oguchi Unachukwu, 42, from Umuomumu Umueze Mbieri in Mbaitoli council was shot dead by personnel of the Air Force 211 Regiment Group at the tollgate of the Sam Mbakwe Cargo Airport.\n\nThe deceased was on his way to catch his flight to Lagos en route to his base in Germany.\n\nHe was shot dead in the presence of his wife and two little children who were seeing him off to the airport at about 8:30a.m.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s wife, Ijeoma Unachukwu, in a petition by her lawyer to both the Imo State Commissioner of Police and the Chief of Air Staff, demanded justice over the gruesome and unprovoked murder of her husband.\n\nHer counsel, Ihediohamma Akponye, who addressed journalists in Owerri, said that it was the screaming of the wife that had stopped further shootings by the Air Force personnel after the bullet hit him on the forehead.\n\nThe trigger-happy airman then ferried him first to the Naval hospital along Aba road before he was taken to the Federal Medical Centre Owerri where they abandoned him.\n\nSimilarly, soldiers had on April 30, also shot and killed Noel Chigbu, a businessman at a checkpoint in Amakohia for allegedly violating \u201ccheckpoint rules\u201d.\n\nThis was barely five days after soldiers had also shot and killed a first year student of the Imo State University, Divine Nwaneri, at a checkpoint close to the Government House, Owerri.\n\nThe deceased eldest brother and spokesperson for the family, Tobechi Chigbu, told our correspondent that the soldiers at Amakohia flyover in Owerri killed his younger brother around 10:p.m on that fateful Friday.\n\nHe disclosed that Noel was shot dead the same day he took delivery of his new car, a Toyota Camry, and was driving home after dropping his friend.\n\nTobechi further revealed that the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operations in the state was the one who told the family that the soldiers said they shot him because he \u201cviolated their checkpoint rule.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cNoel is one of my siblings, He would have been 39 by May 18, but unfortunately, he was shot dead on the day he took the delivery of his new vehicle. His corpse was dumped at FMC in Owerri by the soldiers who killed him. The Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operations told us that the military men who brought his car to the command headquarters said that they killed him for violating their checkpoint rule.\u201d\n\nThe distraught elder brother of the deceased vowed that the family is going to make sure that the identity of the military men who killed his brother were identified and prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe DCP in charge of operations told us that soldiers brought the vehicle about 1am on Saturday. The solders dropped his phone, the car key and a bunch of keys; that of his house keys with the police. He also said that the military guys dropped N5,400, belonging to my brother.\n\n\u201cAt first, he said that the military men didn\u2019t want to make any statement, but the police insisted and reluctantly in a quarter page sheet the soldiers wrote that the owner of the vehicle which is my brother violated their checkpoint rule and they shut and killed him. They also wrote that the relatives of the owner of the vehicle should be referred to FMC in Owerri if they come.\n\n\u201cThe DCP asked us to go to the morgue and that we shouldn\u2019t bother going to the emergency unit of the hospital. That was when we knew that he was dead. The DCP then handed me over the money, his phone and the keys and I took a photograph with him.\n\n\u201cAt FMC, we discovered that the military men who killed him refused to register him properly and the attendant said they were even threatening them. When we uncovered his body we saw two bullet holes at the back of his head and one bullet hole at the back side of his cheeks region. The bullet is still in his body as we speak,\u201d Tobechi narrated.\n\nIn the case of Casmir Ibe, he was on his way to buy a casket for the burial of his father-in-law when he was arrested alongside four other young men by the police, hours after gunmen had set ablaze the Orji Police Division, Owerri, on Tuesday, May 24.\n\nIbe, who had arrived the state the previous day from Rivers State where he works with an oil firm, was arrested and immediately paraded as one of the gunmen who had set ablaze the Orji Police Division and he and others, were reportedly taken to the Force headquarters, Abuja.\n\nCasmir\u2019s elder brother, Chinedu told our correspondent the whole episode was laughable and smacked of lack of professionalism on the part the police, to have tagged his brother who had verifiable means of livelihood as a bandit.\n\nHowever, military authorities in the state maintained sealed lips on the issues of intimidation, harassment, indiscriminate arrest, and killings of innocent citizens of the state.\n\nImo police spokesman, Bala Elkana denied any indiscriminate arrests by the police, explaining that what they were doing was driven by intelligence gathering.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be arresting people, I don\u2019t know of any indiscriminate arrest, but what we are doing is intelligence-driven, we arrest people based on information available to us, those saying that those we arrested are their relations, who does not have a relation, everybody has a relation\u201d, Elkana said.\n\nInvestigations by our correspondent revealed that Owerri residents now observe a kind of a self-imposed curfew as most of them are usually seen rushing back to their homes as early as 6:00p.m, for fear of being arrested by security agents and tagged as ESN/IPOB members. They also want to avoid being victims of stray bullets from sporadic shootings by the security agents who indulge in \u201cgun warming\u201d.\n\nPatrick Ohanele who operates a bar at the Work Bank area of the capital metropolis lamented over current poor sales in the state.\n\nFood vendors around popular resorts and clubs in Owerri also lament over low patronage as a consequence of the prevailing security situation, which has crippled night life.\n\nBattle against gunmen not yielding result in Abia\n\nThe battle against the purported unknown gunmen is yielding little or no fruit in Abia State. Although the State Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu in a recent interview, explained that the state government had put measures in place to checkmate activities of the said unknown gunmen, yet these men carry out incessant attacks on police formations and other public buildings with military precision and success.\n\nAs at the last count, despite the claim by the police and state government of putting in place plans to neutralize their activities, over 11 police formations, including INEC offices and others, had been razed and some policemen killed. The attacks have remained a reoccurring decimal.\n\nOn May 29, the state CID building was completely razed by gunmen, who also killed two Inspectors of Police. The following day, the police through the PPRO, Geoffrey Ogbonna, informed that eight of the hoodlums were equally gunned down by security agents.\n\nHowever, people disputed the police version, saying that those killed knew nothing about the burning of the police building.\n\nA woman, who gave her name as Mrs Edith told Sunday Sun of how her two children, Obinna and Anthony, were marched out of their house on Saturday night at the Ugwunchara area of Umuahia (axis of the burnt state CID) and killed by security agents.\n\n\u201cThe elderly one, Obinna, just came back from work that Saturday evening, while his younger brother, Anthony was lying down inside our room, all of a sudden, some security men in uniform, broke into our room, forced out the two boys and shot them dead before our eyes.\n\n\u201cAs I speak with you, two of my sons are in the mortuary for not doing anything wrong\u201d, she sobbed.\n\nAn Umuahia-based cleric who wouldn\u2019t want his name mentioned for security reasons, accused the police of being economical with the truth.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese are responsible men that police and army went to their houses and jumped through the fence at 9:00p.m on Saturday, six hours after the CID invaders had gone. They took them away before the women in the yard, only for people to see them assassinated in cold blood yesterday (Sunday).\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that after the incident, the Police PRO, Geoffrey Ogbonna criminally turned around to claim that they were the gunmen they killed on crossfire. Their families as eyewitnesses are here crying for the intervention of government.\u201d\n\nThe cleric called on the Abia government to defend the youths and the people of the state, noting that if nothing was done, \u201cthere is going to be the cleansing of our youths\u201d.\n\nAnother resident who gave her name as Amarachi also alluded to this, alleging that the tricycle operator claimed to have been killed during crossfire, was actually shot dead in an area that had nothing to do with the Saturday incident.\n\nGunmen ran over the home of prominent Ohafia son in Abia State, Chief O.K. Ugba and destroyed all within sight.\n\nAccording to Ugba\u2019s brother, his offence was that he built a house in his village and installed solarlights within the vicinity and the \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d misjudged this to mean that the man installed cameras to monitor their activities, and they struck.\n\nThe man\u2019s mansion was burnt; his fleet of cars, including a G-Wagon, BMW X6, Range Rover Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) and others were all razed.\n\nAbia PPRO, SP Ogbonna denied knowledge of any extra-judicial killings in the state, particularly that of Ugwunchara.\n\nAnambra residents count losses\n\nIn Anambra State, the activities of gunmen have led to loss of lives and property in different parts of the state. Many police stations and public facilities have also been burnt down even as over 15 security operatives have been killed.\n\nAlso, the gunmen destroyed security vehicles and carted away guns and other security equipment belonging to the police, military and other security operatives who were felled.\n\nThe last two attacks on public facilities and security formations in the state were the ones on the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Awka, the state capital, and a military checkpoint in Ihiala LGA.\n\nThe Ihiala incident happened at a checkpoint mounted along the Onitsha\u2013Owerri Road and five soldiers were feared killed even as their patrol vehicle was set ablaze by the gunmen.\n\nCommissioner of Police in the state, CP Chris Owolabi, said that his men recorded a major success as they were able to repel the criminals when they attacked INEC.\n\nHe said that three of the gunmen\u2019s vehicles were demobilized and some firearms recovered from them.\n\nHe added that the police were already combing hospitals and remote areas looking for the fleeing hoodlums.\n\nOwolabi said: \u201cIn the onset, there was an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) thrown into the place which exploded at the charge room of \u2018B\u2019 Division and set the room on fire. But we all knew that it was a decoy to attack INEC.\n\n\u201cSo, we proceeded to the INEC where we were able to engage the hoodlums with the three vehicles they came with. We demobilized the three vehicles which made them scamper for safety.\n\n\u201cAnd we recovered quite a number of firearms from them. We recovered about six pump actions, one G2 rifle and one AK rifle. Investigations are still ongoing because it seems the developments are changing.\u201d\n\nResident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Dr Nkwachukwu Oji, said that although their collation centre, vehicles and stores were burnt, it was not a major damage for the commission.\n\n\u201cIt is not a major damage. So, we thank God. I think that the police were able to do their job effectively. The areas that were affected were the areas we can easily recover. We are still taking stock of what we lost\u201d, Oji said.\n\nA victim of the gunmen\u2019s attack, who works in a filling station, narrated that when the hoodlums arrived at Awka, they first visited their filling station and took some petroleum products and also robbed them of money and phones.\n\nMeanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, could not provide answers when asked about other efforts being made by the police to contain the gunmen especially with regards to how the fight has fared in the state so far.\n\nHe could not also respond to enquiries on the challenges being faced by the police in this fight against gunmen; and perhaps, the specific areas where the command wants the public to step in and assist it.\n\nReprieve for 6 wrongly labelled \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some six innocent citizens of Imo State who were wrongly arrested and falsely labelled by the State Police Command have been released. Five of the six regained their freedom late at night on Thursday, June 3, from the Imo State CID headquarters and Owerri Correctional Centre headquarters, where they were detained.\n\nThe five newly freed innocent citizens are: Smith Amadikwa, Casmir Ugbor, Ojukwu Ukonu, Emeka Mbonu and Ikechukwu Okomah.\n\nA statement by the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), based in Onitsha, Anambra State said: \u201cThey were wrongly arrested on 12th, 13th, 14th, 13th and 19th May 2021, respectively; and publicly paraded on 28th May 2021 and falsely labelled \u201cESN hoodlums that attacked Imo State Correctional/Prisons Headquarters and others\u201d.\n\nIntersociety in the statement noted that their case clearly showed the extent that citizens arrested non-violently and taken into custody at the State CID had been shot and killed or tortured to death with their bodies permanently disappeared to avoid traces.\n\nSimilarly, it listed other persons wrongly detained and branded ESN/IPOB members in Owerri, Imo State to include, Casmir Ibegbulem, released on Tuesday, June 1, 2021: \u201cCitizen Casmir Ibegbulem (an oil company staff in Bayelsa State), alongside Citizens Chinonso John (an Owerri based barber), Chukwudi Okoro (Orji-Owerri based shuttle bus owner/transporter), Chigaemezu Sebastian (Owerri Timber Market trader/plumber) and Daberechi Alozie (25 years old apprentice aluminum fabricator with Oceanic Aluminum, Owerri) were arrested on 25th May 2021 at Orji part of Owerri and later paraded. Two days later, on 27th May, 2021, they were taken to the Force headquarters, Abuja, from where Citizen Ibegbulem was forced to \u2018buy his freedom\u2019 with whopping N1.5m after five days of detention.\u201d\n\nAccording to Emeka Umeagbalasi, Board Chairman of Intersociety, Ibegbulem, had on his release, made an audio voice message of gratitude and revelation of what he went through and saw at the State CID, Owerri and the Force Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nHis account included how he was allegedly brought out from cell by his Investigating Police Officer (IPO) at the Force headquarters and allegedly asked if he was ready to pay N10m for his freedom as \u201can oil company staff\u201d.\n\nAlso revealed in the audio was how he bargained and priced \u201cN800, 000\u201d, forcing him to be thrown back into the cell in anger by the IPO.\n\nHe further disclosed in the recorded audio how scores of detained citizens labelled \u201cIPOB/ESN members\u201d were routinely shot and killed extra-judicially or tortured to death.\n\nThe group, therefore, demanded that the alleged N1.5 million collected must be returned to Ibegbulem\u2019s family and there shall be total discontinuation of such extortion and custodial torture and killings or forced disappearances and unlawful executions by the Force headquarters.\n\nIntersociety had on May 31, released a special report chronicling how soldiers, police and other security operatives hatefully and falsely labelled innocent citizens and spilled their bloods in the East and on June 2, the IGP, Chairman of Police Service Commission and Commissioner of Police, Imo State Command were written to and strongly called upon to investigate, review, release, discharge and acquit all the innocent citizens wrongly arrested, detained and falsely labelled.\n\nSunday Sun learnt that six of the 12 names and photos of the arrested and falsely labelled innocent citizens included in the letter, were eventually freed while six are still remaining.\n\nIn a related development, the Owerri branch of Nigerian Bar association (NBA) had after its recent meeting with the Commissioner of Police and the Security Adviser to the Governor, opened a help desk at the Bar Centre from June 4, to collate the names of innocent Imolites unjustly arrested and detained by the Nigeria Police for the purpose of securing their release.\n\nA statement by the Publicity Secretary, Uzor Enwere said that the Bar, through its Committee on Human Rights will anchor and coordinate the help desk.\n\nIt explained that complaints received will be taken up with the appropriate quarters in order to secure the release of these detainees; considering that the courts were not sitting owing to the strike by the judiciary staff union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\nAn Owerri-based legal practitioner said: \u201cThis approach is dictated by the precarious security situation in Imo State at the moment which has the semblance of war situation.\u201d\n\nFear of \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen grips Ebonyi, Enugu\n\nSunday Sun findings showed that gunmen became more daring in Enugu and Ebonyi states in the last three months.\n\nIn the night of Monday, April 26, gunmen attacked a military checkpoint at Amasiri Junction in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, killing two soldiers. Two gunmen were also reportedly killed.\n\nFew days after, hoodlums again attacked the Abaomege Police Station in nearby Onicha Local Government Area of the state and killed an officer attached to the station.\n\nSimilarly, two policemen on duty at a checkpoint around the Onuebonyi area of Abakaliki were recently mauled down by gunmen and their patrol vehicle set ablaze.\n\nPrior to this period, police stations at Onueke, Ezza South Local Government, Ebonyi LGA and Isu in Onicha LGA were also attacked.\n\nLike in Imo, Ebonyi governor, David Umahi blamed hoodlums and desperate opposition leaders for the security crisis in his state.\n\nUmahi said that contrary to the belief in some quarters that the IPOB and its security arm, ESN, were responsible for the killings of security agents and burning of government facilities in the state that desperate opposition leaders from Ebonyi were indeed behind the mayhem.\n\nHe alleged that some desperate opposition politicians were sponsoring hoodlums, thugs and bandits to cause crisis just to discredit his government and to score cheap political points.\n\nThe governor dropped the bombshell when the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 9, Etim Okon, paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House, Abakaliki recently.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cLet me condemn very seriously the killing of security agents in this state. I have said it severally that burning of police stations and INEC offices will never help anyone. Yesterday, two INEC offices in Ezza North and Ebonyi local government areas were razed, and there was also an attempt to burn a filling station that I owned before now two days ago, and attempted assassination of the publicity secretary of APC.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the allegation by the opposition in the state that the killing of the police was masterminded by the Ebubeagu security outfit, meant that they knew about the killings\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t look far. These are the people fighting you; these are the people killing you. These are the truth. If you want to find out, go to their Facebook and check,\u201d Umahi told the AIG.\n\nHowever, three of the persons accused by the governor namely, Ali Odefa, Linus Okorie and Chidiebere Egwu, have since dismissed the allegation, describing it as false and politically motivated.\n\nThey claimed that Umahi made the allegation against them because they refused to defect to the APC with him.\n\nRegardless, Ebonyi has been the worst hit by suspected herdsmen attacks this year alone. Barely a week ago, suspected herdsmen had attacked some Ebonyi communities living in the border area of Benue, killing at least 30 persons.\n\nThe three communities attacked which share boundary with Ado Local Government Area of Benue State include Odoke, Ndiobasi and Obakotara communities in Ebonyi local government area of the state.\n\nA resident of the area, Uchenna Okpokwu, said that the herdsmen invaded the area with guns and machetes.\n\n\u201cThey came into Ndiobasi village and started slaughtering the people. After slaughtering them, they entered Odoke, from that Odoke, they went to Obapta\u201d, he bemoaned.\n\nTwo other gory attacks had happened in a two-week sequence; the massacre of Egedegede community in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state by Fulani herdsmen in addition to the latest killings in Umuoguduakpu Ngbo in Ohaukwu LGA.\n\nThe bloody attack at Egedegede Junction in Egedegede community of Ishielu LGA had spread pain, sorrow and anguish in the surrounding communities of Obeagu, Amazu, Umuhuali and Nkalaha, as well as Ehamufu in Enugu State. No fewer than 20 persons were killed by AK-47 wielding Fulani marauders, while four persons were reportedly killed in the Fulani herdsmen violent attack on Ngbo community.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Umahi on May 2, urged bandits and criminals terrorising the state to lay down their arms and come for negotiations, stressing that his administration was ready to assuage their grievances.\n\nHe also promised that his government will ensure their comprehensive empowerment for the sake of peace and progress of the state.\n\nAlso, the attention of gunmen seems to have shifted to Enugu State lately with the growing cases of attacks.\n\nResidents of the state woke up on Monday, May 17, to hear that the Independence Layout State headquarters of INEC was attacked by hoodlums on Sunday night.\n\nThe gunmen whose mission was to set the INEC state headquarters on fire only succeeded in burning about six Hilux vans and some sections of the building before the quick intervention of a combined team of security agents and fire fighters, who helped in dispersing them and controlling the situation.\n\nAnother office of the INEC in Ibeagwa-aka, Igboeze South Local Government Area of Enugu State was set ablaze by unidentified persons.\n\nThe incident had brought to three the number of INEC offices so far attacked in the state in less than a month. The INEC office in Obollo-Afor, Udenu LGA was the first to be attacked with huge damage recorded.\n\nOn May 25, the Iwollo community in Ezeagu LGA of Enugu State was thrown into deep mourning, following the attack on the Police Division in the area by gunmen. The attack claimed the lives of four policemen and saw total destruction of the station.\n\nTwo out of the four killed policemen were said to be natives of the area and a neighbouring community.\n\nAlso razed were a commuter bus and many motorcycles parked inside the station.\n\nA native of the community said they were woken up by the heavy shooting, \u201cand by the time we came here when the shooting had died down we saw four of the policemen already dead and the whole place burnt.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and the Commissioner of Police, Ndatsu Aliyu who visited the place expressed sadness over the heinous act.\n\nUgwuanyi who condoled with the families of the slain policemen, also ordered for the immediate reconstruction of the damaged police buildings, just as the government replaced the station\u2019s patrol van.\n\nThis was the second attack targeted at a police station in the state after three policemen were killed at the Adani Police Station in Uzo-Uwani LGA in April.\n\nIn the orgy of attacks in the state, some natives had been murdered in Igga, Uzo-Uwani LGA of the state in March this year.\n\nThe latest of the bad news from Enugu was the brutal murder of a retired judge of Enugu State High Court, Justice Stanley Nnaji, on Sunday, May 30 by yet-to-be identified gunmen in Enugu.\n\nNnaji who hailed from Mbu in Isi-Uzo LGA of the state was dragged down from his black Mercedes Benz jeep and shot at close range by his assailants along Okpara Avenue, close to Ebeano Tunnel.\n\nThe gory video of the incident made by an eyewitness from a nearby building has continued to trend on the social media.",

All of us are aware of what happened around the world. COVID-19 struck, even the most important countries or the so-called advanced countries like America lost over 600,000 people, China lost a lot of people. So, we must thank God and we pray for the souls that went in Nigeria, but our number was very small. When the pandemic started, everybody in the world said that they are afraid for Africa, that they will be picking bodies on the streets, but Allah did not allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cNot because we are good people, so we must thank God for His mercies. We must thank our Imams and, of course, our Christian brothers because during lockdown we were challenged and we had meetings with our Imams and they were very forthright, they said if we needed to shut the mosque, then shut it. They did not argue, they said if it was about safety, then shut it down. So, we didn\u2019t have any crisis. We must thank all our Imams, and may Almighty Allah continue to be with you. \u201c\n\nThe governor, however, added that COVID is not yet gone, urging the residents to always observe safety guidelines as established by health experts in order not to contract the virus.\n\nHe warned that there are new variants that could be recorded in the country due to influx of people into the country with reported cases of the deadly variant of the pandemic.",

          "text": "\u2022US, UK, EU, Canada, Ireland, Norway condemn ban\n\n\u2022FG: Microblogging site is synonymous with fake news, misinformation\n\n\u2022Telcos deactivate access to twitter handles in Nigeria\n\n\u2022AGF threatens to prosecute offenders\n\n\u2022Twitter promises Nigerians access to new platform, belatedly deletes Kanu\u2019s vile tweets\n\nTobi Soniyi, Deji Elumoye, Emma Okonji in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Olawale Ajimotokan, Alex Enumah, Michael Olugbode and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nOutraged by Nigeria\u2019s suspension of the microblogging and social media giant, Twitter, for deleting a recent tweet found offensive posted by President Muhammadu Buhari, the world yesterday condemned the decision by the federal government and concluded it was a violation of the rights and freedom of the Nigerian people to communication.\n\nSome of the diplomatic missions that expressed their displeasure against the Twitter ban included Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom,the United States of America and Norway.\n\nBut the federal government, yesterday, justified Twitter\u2019s suspension, saying the outfit had become synonymous with the spread of fake news and misinformation in the country.\n\nThis is as the Telecoms Operators (Telcos) have carried out the instruction of the industry regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to suspend access to all Twitter handles in Nigeria, saying they acted in line with the instruction given to them, in the best interest and integrity of the country.\n\nTo that extent, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) has said the federal government would prosecute anyone, who violates the administrative ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nCondemning the federal government\u2019s decision, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared as unconstitutional, illegal, null and completely of no moment a recent directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to arrest and prosecute any Nigerian using Twitter.\n\nSimilarly, the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), in its reaction, condemned the suspension of Twitter in the country by the federal government and described it as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), on its part, urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria and instead, seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nSharing this view, the International Press Institute (IPI), while expressing concern over the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria,which it said uses twitter as a major platform.\n\nIn the same breath, the Oyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the federal government of Nigeria not to hamper the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nOn the contrary, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on Nigerians to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty by supporting the federal government\u2019s Twitter suspension, saying it was in national interest.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter, yesterday promised to restore access on its new platform to all Nigerians as parts of the choices open to it in the current circumstances, even as it belatedly deleted some bile tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nResponding to the backlash from the move against Twitter, the presidency though described Twitter\u2019s removal of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets as disappointing, it however, said the social media outfit\u2019s suspension has nothing to do with the removal of the President\u2019s tweet.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release, attributed the suspension of Twitter to a lot of problems associated with the media platform including misinformation and fake news, which have had telling effect on Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\nNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\nHe quoted the President as saying in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 that, \u201cThe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, this and similar crimes, which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\nHe emphasised that major tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities and that \u201cthey cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives\u201d.\n\nThis, according to him, could tear some countries apart.\n\nHe stressed that President Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweets, which should have been read in full.\n\nThe release stated: \u201cThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact. A terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens. When the President said that they will be treated \u2018in a language they understand\u2019, he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists. IPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire.\n\n\u201cNow, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country. Twitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d\n\nBut some diplomatic missions in the country have condemned the ban of twitter, insisting that free expression and access to information were the pillars of democracy.\n\nA statement jointly issued yesterday by the the diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Norway, conveyed their disappointment over Nigeria\u2019s announcement, suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe strongly support the fundamental human right of free expression and access to information as a pillar of democracy in Nigeria as around the world and these rights apply online as well as offline.\n\n\u201cBanning systems of expression is not the answer. These measures inhibit access to information and commerce at precisely the moment, when Nigeria needs to foster inclusive dialogue and expression of opinions, as well as share vital information in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe diplomatic missions, however, added that, \u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less, communication to accompany the concerted efforts of Nigeria\u2019s citizens in fulsome dialogue toward unity, peace and prosperity. As Nigeria\u2019s partners, we stand ready to assist in achieving these goals.\u201d\n\nIn yet a separate reaction, the United States, in a statement by its Embassy in Nigeria said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cBanning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater.\n\n\u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity. #KeepitOn\u201d\n\nHowever, on the deactivation of access, the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), the umbrella body of all licensed telecoms operators in Nigeria, in a statement jointly signed by its chairman, Mr. Gbenga Adebayo and its Executive Secretary, Mr. Gbolahan Awonuga, yesterday, confirmed that NCC directed them to suspend access to Twitter.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWe, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator to suspend access to Twitter. ALTON has conducted a robust assessment of the request in accordance with internationally accepted principles.\n\n\u201cBased on national interest provisions in the Nigerian Communications \u2018Act 2003\u2019, and within the licence terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) the industry regulator. We will continue to engage all the relevant authorities and stakeholders and will act as may be further directed by the NCC. We remain committed to supporting the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and upholding the rights of citizens.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly, and to enjoy privacy and security regarding their data and their use of digital communications.\u201d\n\nGiving the implications of the action of the federal government on Twitter, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), in a statement released yesterday, said ATCON was working closely with relevant stakeholders to ensure there is a speedy resolution of the current suspension of Twitter activities in Nigeria.\n\nIn its official statement on the development, which has seen the telecoms regulator issue a directive to the service providers to deny access to the services of Twitter in Nigeria, the President of ATCON, Mr. Ikechukwu Nnamani stated that while the Association and its member companies understand the position of the federal government, the reasons for the directive, and have complied with the directive, it is pertinent that the issue is resolved soon in the interest of all.\n\nNnamani emphasised that the Over The Top (OTT) platforms of which Twitter is one, is an integral part of the digital economy that the federal government is promoting, adding, so when an unfortunate disagreement arises with respect to the user policies, it is good it is resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOther industry stakeholders, who frowned at the action of the federal government, warned against the implications, which they said may affect Nigeria most negatively.\n\nIndustry sources, however, said government seemed not to be concerned about the revenue and job losses that would come with the suspension order.\n\nAlthough they projected huge revenue losses to government and the telecoms operators in terms of revenue generation and payment of taxes, they however said revenue generation appeared not to be more important to government than protecting its authority.\n\nAGF Threatens to Prosecute Offenders\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday,said the federal government would prosecute anyone that violates the administrative ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, Malami, in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, said he had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to begin immediate prosecution of those, who violate the federal government order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, has directed the immediate prosecution of offenders of the federal government ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMalami directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation at the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to swing into action and commence in earnest the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMalami directed the DPPF to liaise with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, National Communication Commission, NCC and other relevant government agencies to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the ban, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, Senator Shehu Sani and others have continued to tweet.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be my last tweet\u201d, Atiku said while criticising the ban.\n\nFormer Senator Sani while mocking the ban said: \u201cI\u2019m sure Baba will be asking about the \u2018meaning\u2019 of that VPN. Those of you from the North, if you want to tweet, take a train to Maradi in Niger Republic, tweet and return home. If you live in Lagos and want to tweet, just go to Cotonou, tweet and come back. Those of you from the South-south, who want to tweet, take a boat through your Creeks to Cameroun, tweet and come back.\u201d\n\nFani-Kayode, in a tweet on Saturday morning stated thus: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter by the FG has proved to the civilised world that they are weak, unstable, paranoid, insensitive, vindictive & delusional. It is a grave abuse of power & a perfidious, insidious & brazen attempt to deny the Nigerian people of their right to free speech.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction to the threat to prosecute offenders, a former Chairman of the Governing Council of the National Human Rights Commission, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, wondered how the government would prosecute citizens for violating an administrative ban.\n\nHe asked: \u201cUnder what law please? The ban is an administrative directive. Lai Mohammed is not a legislature and cannot create a crime.\u201d\n\nMalami\u2019s Prosecution Order Is Illegal, Null and Void, Says PDP\n\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared as unconstitutional, illegal, null and completely of no moment a recent directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to arrest and prosecute any Nigerian using Twitter.\n\nThe PDP asserted that the directive by the APC through the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was not only downright ludicrous, but showed the frenzied desperation by the Buhari Presidency to muzzle, victimize, clamp down on innocent Nigerians and foist a totalitarian system on our country.\n\nThe PDP stated, in statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that nothing in the extant laws, not even the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, constitutionally criminalised the use of Twitter by Nigerians or empowers the federal governments to arrest and prosecute any Nigerians for using Twitter.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cFor Malami\u2019s information, section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides that, \u2018a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari and his APC are informed that there is no extant law that defined the use of Twitter as a criminal offence and there is no penalty prescribed in a written law for the use of Twitter by any Nigerians,\u201d the PDP explained.\n\nThe opposition stated that the APC-led federal government should also realise that the suspension of Twitter, in addition to its unconstitutionality, only suspended Twitter operations and not the use of Twitter by Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, therefore, contended that the directive by the Attorney General to arrest and prosecute any Nigerians found using Twitter, does not have the backing of any law enacted by the National Assembly or any state legislative house, describing Malami\u2019s declaration as completely of no legal consequence.\n\n\u201cMalami\u2019s directive to arrest and prosecute Nigerians using Twitter is therefore an attempt to suspend the 1999 Constitution (as amended), a development which bears the imprints of the leaked memo in which Mr. President was reportedly advised to suspend the constitution and strip Nigerians of their rights and freedom\u201d, the main opposition party said.\n\nTwitter Suspension Is an Overreaction, Says NPAN\n\nThe Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) has condemned the suspension of the operation of microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in the country, describing it as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nNPAN, which took the position on Saturday in a statement by its President, Kabiru A. Yusuf, warned that the action by the federal government after Twitter deleted the tweets by President Muhammadu Buhari to the South-east insurrectionists, who have been vandalizing the symbols of state authority would not win Nigeria friends.\n\nIt, however, noted that the closure of public space would constitute a limit to public discourse and democratic advancement, further describing the ban as a futile exercise, because other platforms were more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population, who have prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies, who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue.\u201d NPAN warned.\n\nThe newspaper proprietors also noted that it was the threat of maximum state reprisal by President Buhari that Twitter found objectionable, in line with its corporate policy, leading to sanction on the President through deletion of his tweets.\n\nIt noted that it was not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy as it did so to former US President Donald Trump, to global acclaim, when the latter used the social media to spread hate and instigate insurrection by a mob, which stormed the Capitol.\n\nAlthough it faulted the federal government, the association also challenged Twitter to correct itself as its sincerity is questionable to the extent that it may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari while showing an uneven application of its rules against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu..\n\nAccording to NPAN, while Nigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of the President, the micro bloggers appeared to be pampering an unrestrained Kanu for using the same Twitter platform not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nEditors Urge FG to Seek Legitimate Means\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria by seeking other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nIn a statement by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) respectively, the NGE said the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians, who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\nAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said the action was an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violated the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cThe Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week. If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u201d, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying that ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u201cHowever, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics, who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens,\u201d the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those, who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of the social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying, Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cThe Guild is aware of the democratising influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u201cTwitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u201d, the Guild said, calling on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians, who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nThe International Press Institute (IPI), while expressing concern over the suspension of Twitter\u2019soperations in Nigeria, described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria, which it said uses twitter as a major platform.\n\nIPI, in a statement by its President and Secretary, Kabir Yusuf and Raheem Adedoyin, however, notedthe concern of the government on the use of twitter and other social media platforms to promote hate speech and disinformation.\n\n\u201cWe urge twitter and other social media outfits to pay greater attention to the content they promote on their platforms, which violate their own rules. IPI implores the government to reverse the suspension of twitter operations in Nigeria and engage in meanigful dialogue with the social media outfit on issues of concern to the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nDon\u2019t Hamper Businesses and Services, Makinde Counsels FG\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the federal government against hampering the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nHe contended that the action by the Buhari administration was capable of affecting investors\u2019 confidence in the country.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Makinde called for due consideration from the government on the implications of its action, saying, \u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who has a strong presence on Twitter, said, it became imperative for him to make the statement as the country debated the ban.\n\nHe, however, warned that the decision, apart from having grave implications for the image of the country, could hamper thousands of businesses and services, which Nigerian youths promote and influence on the platform.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt has become imperative for me to release a statement regarding the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the federal government. As leaders, we should go beyond emotional reactions to issues and think about how our actions will affect the people we lead and our international ratings socially and economically.\n\n\u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion. They use the platform to complain, argue and give feedback to government and its agencies who in turn, use these to improve policies. This is a fundamental point that should be kept in mind as we debate the necessity of this suspension.\n\n\u201cWe should also remember that Twitter has gone beyond a source of communication for many of our hardworking youths in Nigeria. It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings. Nigerian youths and digital communications organisations earn a living from being able to use the platform to post communications on behalf of their clients.\n\n\u201cOthers who may not have physical stores also rely on Twitter to give visibility to their products and services. Furthermore, I believe the federal government should be actively interested in how certain policies and actions will affect investor confidence. I, therefore, use this medium to appeal to the federal government to reverse this suspension for the greater good of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Challenge to Develop Own App, APC Tells Nigerians\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), last night, called on Nigerians to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty by supporting the federal government\u2019s Twitter suspension, saying apart from the fact that the decision was in national interest, it was a challenge to the Nigerian youths to develop another app.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement Saturday, said, \u201cAPC urges Nigerians talented in the development of social media/software applications to seize the opportunity of the suspension of Twitter operations in the country to develop homegrown applications that could rival existing social media platforms and meet the need of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cRussia has VKontakte (VK), China has Weibo, among several homegrown social media platforms. The APC believes that the country has the potentials and talents that can develop alternative and competitive applications to existing platforms in the world. Twitter\u2019s suspension will undoubtedly serve as a positive trigger to unleash the creative potentials of Nigerians in the global digital space.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe claimed it was a challenge to the vibrant youths with such talents, adding that they would get support in the exercise from relevant federal government agencies as well as the numerous Information and Communication Technology (ICT) training and research establishments in the country.\n\nHe recalled that the APC had earlier released a statement asking Twitter and other operators of social media pages to use their platforms to check divisive and inciting rhetoric, particularly in Nigeria.\n\nThe ruling party said it tasked them on the important responsibilities to curb fake news, disinformation and hate speech, among others, adding that evidently, \u201cTwitter failed to do this and even allowed their platform to be used by arsonists, insurrectionists and separatists in the country.\u201d\n\nTwitter Promises Nigerians Access to New Platform, Belatedly Deletes Kanu\u2019s Bile Tweets\n\nAmerican microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, has promised to restore access to its new platform to all Nigerians.\n\nA tweet by Twitter\u2019s Public Policy yesterday said open internet was an essential human right and would help Nigerians, who relied on its platform to connect with the world.\n\nTwitter made the vow in reaction to the indefinite suspension slammed on it by the Nigerian Government.\n\nMeanwhile, less than 24 hours after the federal government banned Twitter, the global microblogging platform has deleted \u2018inciting\u2019 tweets from the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist group agitating for the Republic of Biafra.\n\nIn the controversial tweet, the IPOB leader vowed to unleash terror on Nigerian soldiers deployed to the South-east. He also used derogatory words to describe some government officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for the living to respond to the dead but given the lack of reasoning prevalent in the #Zoo Nigeria, I wish to assure @GarShehu (Garba Shehu), the Jihadi midget @elrufai (Nasir El-Rufai) & that Fulani lapdog Femi Adesina that any army they send to #Biafraland will die there. None will return alive,\u201d Kanu tweeted via his handle Wednesday.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Already proposes June 12\n\n\u2022Sacks all commissioners to accommodate APC in new cabinet\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nWith the 2023 political permutations in focus, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State might have concluded plans to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC), but there are far more serious grounds why his defection might be impossible for now.\n\nThe reason is that the Supreme Court decision, which ceded the Zamfara governorship to the PDP immediately after the 2019 elections, did not consider any individual in arriving at the decision but the party, a situation which makes the opposition party the owner and sole beneficiary of the governorship and not Matawalle.\n\nAlready, arrangements are said to have been perfected for the governor to defect to the APC on June 12, where he is expected to be received by the ruling party\u2019s National Caretaker Committee Chairmanand Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlso, as a prelude to the defection, Matawalle had on Monday, May 31, sacked his entire cabinet, including the commissioners, special advisers, the Secretary to the State Government, Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff in other to be able to accommodate some members of the APC in the new calculations.\n\nTHISDAY gleaned that the cabinet sack was to prevent some commissioners from refusing to defect with him and avoid the kind of backslash experienced in Ebonyi and Cross River States, where some commissioners and aides refused to go to the APC with their former principals.\n\nCuriously, however, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has yet to officially speak on the developing story, but an informed party source hinted that having given all the political structures in the state to the governor, the PDP was at a loss as to why Matawalle wanted to leave the party.\n\nBut the source was confident that the governor would not gamble with the idea, knowing that the seat is the party\u2019s and not his, the reason the deputy governor is said to have declined being part of the defection plan, since he would be the sole beneficiary of Matawalle\u2019s false move if he eventually dared the consequences.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the governor\u2019s planned defection was due to the politics of 2023. The governor, it was learnt, has been promised a return ticket for 2023. He is currently serving his first term in office.\n\nIn 2019, the APC won all the state and national elections in Zamfara State, the PDP came second but due to the Supreme Court judgement, the PDP inherited the victory across the board.\n\nThe state was considered an APC state and it was therefore to ensure his reelection in 2023 that Matawelle was being poached to defect to the APC.\n\nAnother party source also hinted that, \u201cThere is no free ticket for him in the APC by 2023, as the former governor of the state, Abdulazizi Yari and Senator Kabir Marafa have reconciled and will surely give him a fight \u201d\n\nBut a PDP source said the APC in Zamfara State was like a shark infected water, waiting to consume the governor, if he made the mistake of defecting to the APC.\n\nIn February this year, the political feud between the two warring camps in the state chapter of the APC \u2013 Yari and Marafa \u2013 were reconciled, by the national caretaker committee of the party as part of the 2023 scheming.\n\nThe source said it was not certain whether all PDP senators and members of the House of Representatives that benefited from the Supreme Court judgement would be willing to defect with himtoo.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cIf the governor defects what will happen to the governorship ambition of Senator Marafa? Will he subdue his ambition that caused his initial political feud with former governor Yari or will he go back to the senate? If he decides to go to the Senate, what will happen to the current senator that is from the PDP?\u201d, the PDP source stated.\n\nYari, Zamfara\u2019s immediate past governor is plotting to become the national chairman of the APC, and has been at daggers-drawn with Matawalle, who became an unexpected beneficiary of the APC crisis in the 2019 primaries in the state.\n\nThe source that spoke to newsmen said Mattawlle was expected to join the APC on June 12 as ademocracy dividend to the state.\n\nSo far, two PDP governors have joined the APC. The first to dump the PDP was the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and he was recently followed by the Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, with Matawelle already in view, if he defected as being planned.\n\nHowever, Yari is said not to be not living any thing to chance as he still holds the ace in the state.\n\nBut a source claimed that to weaken Yari, all the states structures of the APC in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory would be dissolved soon.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the reasons APC is delaying their convocation of the national convention of the APC. By the delay, all the interests would be accommodated, including all that are defecting, so that everyone will be equal and own the structures at all levels of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBut, the former governor, the source noted, would not go down without a fight, because if Mattawelle joined, the APC, he might be finished politically, as state structures are naturally in the hands of the governors.\n\nWhen THISDAY contacted PDP\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, he said, \u201cI will see the National Chairman and thereafter contact you \u201c, but he did not eventually get, even though sources claimed the opposition party was waiting for Matawalle to make the biggest mistake of his life.\n\nA PDP source said the party was in possession of intelligence report that the Zamfara governor had gone as far as seeking the opinions of some Supreme Court justices, who had told him leaving the PDP would definitely cost him the seat, based on the Supreme Court judgment of 2019.\n\nBut the governor was said to have contacted some highly placed persons in the government and party, who had allegedly assured him that they would circumvent the law for his sake and ensure he did not lose the seat.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says constitution review will not achieve anything\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong\n\nOyo State Governor, Mr. \u2018Seyi Makinde, has said his government would not comply with a recent Supreme Court ruling on the local government administration, because contrary to the constitutionally recognised 33 local governments, there are additional 35 local council development areas, making it 68, a number he claimed he couldn\u2019t work with.\n\nHe, therefore, said the former council chairpersons might have to approach the apex court again to determine which of them should be paid.\n\nHowever, in a related development, the governor has doubted the possibility of the ongoing amendment to the constitution, saying any amendment to the 1999 constitution without restructuring would be nothing, but a waste of time and as such, an exercise in futility.\n\nThe Supreme Court, last month, overturned Makinde\u2019s sack of the council chairpersons in the state. Removal of the 68 council chairpersons, who were elected in 2018, was one of the early decisions of the governor as soon as he was sworn in, in May 2019.\n\nThe officials, drawn from the 33 local government areas (LGAs) and 35 local council development areas (LCDAs) and their councillors, were members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe court also decided that the replacement of the sacked officials with caretaker committees was illegal and therefore fined Mr. Makinde\u2019s administration N20 million.\n\nBut the court appeared to favour Makinde by noting that the tenures of the sacked council chairmen and councilors had expired. It, however, ordered that all their outstanding salaries and allowances must be paid with immediate effect.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY at the Government House, Ibadan, Makinde said, \u201cThe Constitution of Nigeria recognises 33 local government areas and 351 wards in Oyo State. The previous administration created local development areas and increased the number to 68. We couldn\u2019t work with that, so, we scrapped it and put in place caretaker committees before proper elections were held in the 33 constitutionally recognised local government areas.\u201d\n\nMakinde, who further broke down his understanding of the court judgment, posited that, \u201cWhat the Supreme Court invariably said is that it is its policy that governors should not dissolve local government administrations. They expected me to approach the court to argue the unconstitutionality of the 35 LCDAs.\n\n\u201cIf I had gone to court, it would have taken this length of time for them to reach a decision by which time they would have served out their tenure. They have to go back to court to determine, who among them should be paid. And I doubt if that matter can be decided during my tenure. I may be out of here by that time,\u201d he added.\n\nDefending himself and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), against alleged manipulation in the recent local government elections in the state, in which the PDP won all the 32 local government areas, where elections were held, said it was by choice that he resisted pressure to manipulate the elections.\n\n\u201cI deliberately appointed a Senior Advocate of Nigeria as Chairman of the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission, because I know he will be independent-minded. I have not even spoken to him after the election. I did not know him before the appointment. People told me it was the first time they are taking part in local government election. Even my own people told me it is not done that way. They wanted us to write figures and announce results. I refused to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his position that the constitution review would be an exercise in futility, he said he was ready to stake his future political career on the prediction that nothing fruitful would come out of the exercise,which he described \u201cas an annual jamboree to waste money.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cIf this constitution amendment succeeds, that will be the end of my political career. That is how strongly I feel about the waste of time and one that is going on. Former President Goodluck Jonathan supervised the production of a document, which many Nigerians agreed is the best document for our civil relations, he did not sign it into law, because he thought he was going to return as President. That document is there and this administration has refused to do something about it.\u201d\n\nHe explained that true federalism goes beyond resource control, adding: \u201cIt is the fundamental of how we develop as a people. We should not say because these people are backward, then, you bring everybody to the same starting line. A country must allow its people to develop at their pace.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) has condemned the suspension of the operation microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in the country by the Federal Government as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nNPAN made the denunciation Saturday in a statement signed by its President Kabiru A. Yusuf.\n\nThe statement warned that the action by the federal government after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari to separatist agitators, would not win Nigeria friends. It noted that the closure of public space would constitute a limit to public discourse and democratic advancement.\n\nNPAN described the ban as a futile exercise, saying other platforms were more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population who have prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue.\u201d NPAN warned.\n\nThe newspaper proprietors noted that it was the threat of maximum state reprisal by President Buhari that Twitter found objectionable, in line with its corporate policy, leading to sanction on the President through deletion of his tweet.\n\nIt noted that it was not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy as it did so to former US President Donald Trump, to global acclaim when the latter used the social media to spread hate and instigate insurrection by a mob which stormed the Capitol.\n\nAlthough it faulted the federal government, the association also challenged Twitter to correct itself as its sincerity was questionable to the extent that it may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari while showing an uneven application of its rules against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAccording to NPAN, while Nigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of the President, the micro bloggers appeared to be pampering an unrestrained Kanu for using the same Twitter platform not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Twitter ban rewinds Nigeria to pre-internet darkness and reign of fear",
          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is its citizens\u2019 use of Twitter, and all media enabled by the internet.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought the country had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "title": "5 Reasons Why You Should Consider A Loan from Page Financials",
          "text": "Personal loans are good for a variety of purposes\u2014from consolidating debt to solving a myriad of pressing issues. They are personal, which means your reasons are yours.\n\nDo you remember the first time you needed more money than you had? Borrowing money then was not as easy as it is now.\n\nYou probably would have run to family members or friends which usually meant nothing was certain, or apply for a bank loan, which was a very tedious process, hard to get \u2013 especially if you do not have an enviable collateral in choice locations, or know someone in top management position in the banks to stand as a guarantor.\n\nThe situation is completely different now. There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase. You will be required to provide these details to help us to verify your identity and financial standing.\n\nLoan Requirements for Private Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a private sector employee, it is required that:\n\nYou earn a monthly salary (minimum 150k monthly) You have up to 6-months\u2019 salary account statement You live/work in Lagos or Ibadan (bankers nationwide can apply) You have a valid work ID from where you work or an evidence of employment or promotion You have a BVN that is actively connected to your working mobile number\n\nSome of the items above will be retrieved automatically when you begin the application, it usually takes customers less than 3 minutes to complete the application if they have the requirements ready.\n\nTo apply as a private sector employee click here\n\nLoan Requirements for Public Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a Federal Government Civil Servant, it is required that:\n\nYou have your work ID You have a valid Government issued ID You have at least 3 months\u2019 payslips You will present a signed letter of authority to debit (the letter is available for download on our website)\n\nTo apply as a public sector employee, click here\n\nReasons to Avoid a Personal Loan\n\nWhile personal loans can be a saving grace in times of great need, there are some instances you should avoid borrowing money. Consider avoiding a personal loan if:\n\nYou can\u2019t afford it. Borrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it.\n\nBorrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it. You don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of something you don\u2019t need in the immediate future, think about putting it off until you have more cash on hand.\n\nThe Page customer service is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "On Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nHe also disclosed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing all over-the-top (OTT) and social media operations.\n\nThe move has understandably drawn outrage from Nigerians who see it as yet another attack on free speech by the government. However, free speech is not the only thing affected.\n\nThe Twitter ban could also affect the country\u2019s economy. Consequently, investor confidence would weaken, and there\u2019d be a negative impact on development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2016 World Bank study found a correlation between increased broadband penetration and an increase in per capita GDP.\n\nIn addition, Internet or social media shutdowns cost sub-Saharan countries $237.4 million in 2020.\n\nWe examine how this ban could affect Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nInfluencers\n\nOver the past few years, the influencer marketing space in Nigeria has grown so much that almost anyone with dedicated followers could snag deals with organisations looking to extend their reach.\n\nThough some influencers \u2014 mostly lifestyle \u2014 use Instagram more, Twitter is the primary platform for most of them.\n\nWhile the organisations that work with them can easily use other channels for their marketing activities, it could be harder for them to do the same.\n\nAlso, while they may be able to afford VPN services, their followers who keep them in business may be unable or reluctant to do so. Either way, this does not end well for these influencers.\n\nFreelancers\n\nThe increase in Internet penetration has increased the number of people making a living off the Internet, specifically social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom social media managers to content creators and product photographers, thousands of Nigerians have created careers off these platforms. This ban puts their sources of livelihood at risk.\n\nIn a previous article, we examined how Nigerians are now using Twitter to get jobs, investors, and fill vacancies. These are all activities that a social media ban would hinder.\n\nStartups\n\nNigeria\u2019s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth in a short time, with $3,77.4 million raised in 2019, although that figure fell to $120.6 million in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis has resulted in jobs for a significant number of people and revenue in the form of taxes for the government.\n\nHowever, this ban puts all of that at risk. For most startups, their businesses depend, in some part, on social media.\n\nWithout access to social media to run marketing campaigns or build relationships with their customers, business would take a hit. Applications that are built using Twitter APIs are also affected.\n\nWhat did these humans do fgs? Block twitter and thereby blocking every other domain that has twitters apis embedded in it? React native elements, UI kitten, my components libraries are not working. I can\u2019t do my work. Wth is wrong with this country! \u2014 Mazi Juls (@AAjulibe) June 5, 2021\n\nWhile these businesses would find ways to innovate around the ban, their users may not.\n\nYou now have to add \u201chow would navigate a government ban\u201d to the type of questions you might have to answer when fundraising. \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) June 4, 2021\n\nPolitical stability is one of the factors that investors consider while making investment decisions. By banning Twitter and directing the NBC to start licensing OTT services in the country, investors are not likely to jump at the opportunity of investing in Nigerian startups depriving the country of much-needed investments.\n\nMerchants\n\nSmall and medium enterprises are vital to the growth of any economy, frequently providing as much as 60-70% of the economy with jobs. Numbering about 117.4 million, SMEs in Nigeria contribute 48% of national GDP, account for 96% of businesses, and 84% of employment.\n\nMany SMEs have leveraged the Internet, especially social media, for business activities such as marketing and customer service. The number of vendors on Twitter and Instagram is a testament to this.\n\nWhile these businesses could move to other platforms, their posts might not gain as much engagement as Twitter provides. What\u2019s more? There are no assurances that a ban on other social media platforms would not follow.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be indefinitely blocking access to microblogging and social media platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Information and Culture made this move known on its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n\n\nFG Suspends @Twitter Operations in Nigeria pic.twitter.com/7z5BQ0Mi3U \u2014 Fed Min of Info & Cu (@FMICNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nPer the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, the government made this suspension due to the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis move comes just a few days after Twitter deleted a controversial tweet made by Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

          "title": "#EndSARS: 99 bodies deposited at Lagos morgue, three from Lekki tollgate \u2013 Pathologist",
          "text": "At least 99 people were killed in Lagos during the #EndSARS protest and had their bodies deposited at a morgue in the state, an official has said.\n\nThe victims include three that were killed in Lekki during the shooting by soldiers at unarmed protesters on October 20, 2020, the Chief Pathologist of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), John Obafunwa, told a Judicial Panel of Inquiry.\n\nHe said autopsies were done on the 99 dead bodies which were brought to the morgues between October 19 and 24, 2020. He, however, did not present the details of the autopsies.\n\nMr Obafunwa, a professor of Medicine and Head of the Department of Morbid Anatomy at the Lagos University College of Medicine, spoke on Saturday while giving evidence to assist the judicial panel in its investigation of the October 20, 2020, Lekki tollgate shooting incident.\n\nThe don told the panel that only three corpses were recorded to have been from Lekki, and 96 other bodies from different parts of Lagos.\n\nSaturday proceedings\n\nWhile giving evidence on the number of dead bodies received from Lekki on the day of the shooting incident, Mr Obafunwa said LASUTH has only three records.\n\nHe presented the pictures of three bodies from Lekki to the panel, showing different degrees of injuries.\n\n\u201cThose are the three bodies I was told were from Lekki as recorded by the people who brought them in,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile being cross-examined by Olumide Fusika, a counsel to some #EndSARS protesters, Mr Obafunwa disclosed that a total of 99 bodies were recorded between October 19 and 24.\n\n\u201cI want to prove to this panel that the claim that only three dead bodies were brought in from Lekki is not true,\u201d Mr Fusika said, while questioning the pathologist.\n\nMr Fusika, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, requested that the panel order the chief pathologist to present the records of all 99 cases recorded during the period.\n\n\u201cSince he was told that only those three are from Lekki, he might have been told the wrong thing,\u201d Mr Fusika said.\n\nMr Obafunwa explained that the bodies were deposited by the Lagos State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (SEHMU), an agency in charge of recovering dead bodies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go about scavenging for dead bodies. It is when they are brought in that we are told and it is recorded where they were taken from.\u201d\n\nThe chief pathologist said according to their records, the bodies were recovered from different parts of Lagos including Ikorodu, Lagos Mainland, Yaba and Mushin.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES earlier reported how the Lagos State Chief Coroner, Mojisola Dada, called on members of the public whose family members went missing between October 19 and 27 to contact the Department of Pathology and Forensic Medicine, LASUTH for the bodies.\n\n\u201cThis is to notify the General Public that the Chief Coroner of Lagos State, Hon Justice M. A. Dada (Mrs.) pursuant to Section 15, Coroner\u2019s System Law of Lagos State, 2015 the Pathology Team would want all those who have lost loved ones between 19th \u2013 27th October 2020 (that is, next-of-kin of the victims) to provide relevant information that would assist the identification exercise,\u201d the public notice read.\n\nHowever, there have been several testimonies from witnesses of the Lekki tollgate shooting incident that many protesters were shot dead by soldiers\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSarah Ibrahim, one of the protesters, told them panel that at least 10 persons died in the incident.\n\nMr Fusika requested that the chief coroner be ordered to produced records of the 99 deaths to the panel, including the autopsy reports.\n\nIn her ruling, Doris Okuwobi, the chair of the panel, ruled that the chief pathologist should produce a record showing the 99 deaths at the next adjourned date.\n\nHowever, she said, autopsy reports will not be required as that would expand the work of the panel beyond the terms of reference.\n\nThe matter was adjourned till June 19.\n\nLekki Shooting\n\nThe shooting of unarmed protesters by soldiers on October 20, 2020 generated controversies, including the number of people killed and injured during the incident.\n\nAlthough the Nigerian Army initially denied its soldiers shot at unarmed protesters, the multitude of evidence presented by witnesses, including videos showed that soldiers shot at protesters.\n\nThe state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, initially said no one died from the shooting, but later said only two persons died.\n\nSeveral protesters have appeared before the judicial panel to give evidence that many people were killed at the Lekki tollgate and many others injured.\n\nThe protesters said some of the corpses were taken away by the soldiers.\n\nIt is still unclear the number of people that died from the shooting incident, but several protesters have come forward with different degrees of gunshot injuries sustained during the shooting.",

          "text": "The presidency has justified what it called a temporary suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, noting that it is part of efforts to prevent the violent consequences usually linked to the spread of fake news and misinformation.\n\nLai Mohammed, minister of information, had announced the \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria on Friday, sparking angry reactions.\n\nThe suspension had come after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari in which he made reference to Biafra war, while vowing to treat those destroying public facilities in the language they understand.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Saturday, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, said the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is not only because Buhari\u2019s post was deleted, even as he hinted that the ban was temporary.\n\n\u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\n\u201cThe President in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 said \u201cthe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers. This and similar crimes which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweet which should have been read in full. The tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact.\u201d\n\nHe explained what Buhari meant by the post on the Civil War experience, adding that with the current security challenges, the federal government needs to take measures to prevent escalation of tensions.\n\n\u201cA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens. When the President said that they will be treated \u201cin a language they understand,\u201d he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over,\u201d Shehu said.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d",

          "text": "The disturbing security situation in Nigeria was presented to the ECOWAS Parliament on Thursday by the Nigerian Delegation to the regional parliament led by Linda Chuba Ikpeazu, while delivering Nigeria\u2019s Country Report.\n\nThe Delegation presented the horrible security situation of the country to the regional legislature and the attendant devastations on the country at the ongoing 2021 First Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament, taking place in Abuja.\n\nThe nine-page report was replete with political, security, human rights, health situations and the status of implementation of the ECOWAS texts.\n\nIkpeazu told the Community legislature that, \u201cthe security situation in Nigeria is dire\u201d adding that \u201cThere has been a tremendous increase in the spate of unfettered violence, abductions, and killings by terrorist groups, bandits and other criminal elements.\u201d\n\nShe said further that \u201cThe number of reported security incidents within the reporting period shows a progressive increase in insecurity. In the fourth quarter of 2020, 256 security incidents were recorded in which 384 persons were killed and 510 persons kidnapped. By the first quarter of 2021, the number of recorded security incidents have increased by 31.25% to 336 incidents, with the number of people killed increasing by 88.54% to at least 724 persons, while the number of those kidnapped rose by 57.25%, this translates to 802 persons.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Country Report also highlighted that \u201chighways and schools have become target places for the nefarious activities of these bandits and kidnappers, with the North-Western region being hardest hit.\u201d\n\nBetween December 2020 and April 2021, the Nigeria Country report noted that at least 364 students have been kidnapped from their schools, along with countless highway travellers.\n\n\u201cPrimarily affecting the Middle Belt and North-West states, clashes between farmers and herders over land have spurred the formation of ethnic militias and vigilante raids that have resulted in extrajudicial killings and the decimation of towns and villages.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese nomadic herdsmen ravage towns in their path and have had incursions into some states in the South East, South-South and South West of Nigeria. To prevent further loss of lives and properties brought about by these clashes, there is an outright ban on open grazing in the Southern parts of the country,\u201d the report said.\n\nAfter the presentation, the parliament was perhaps left to ponder the possible ways to assist Nigeria wriggle out of the quagmire fearing that an escalation of the crisis could spell doom for the rest of West Africa as Nigeria is the biggest and most populous country in the sub-region.\n\nBut in specific terms, what would the regional parliament and other institutions of ECOWAS do to forestall the Nigerian grim situation?\n\nThe Secretary General of the ECOWAS Parliament, John Azumah, told LEADERSHIP at the weekend that one of the ways to find a solution to the crisis is for the Parliament to assist the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government through lobbying, to come up with resolutions and discussed the issue at the Authority level.\n\nHe believes that if the Parliament brings concrete ideas, concrete suggestions before the Authority and these are followed through, there could be solid support for Nigeria in the fight against insecurity.\n\nBut how far can resolutions go in resolving the Nigerian security crisis when there has been a plethora of previous resolutions that may not have been implemented?\n\nThe Ghanaian Secretary General said \u201cThis is a very frightening situation for all of us in the sub region because whatever happens to Nigeria happens to the sub region. So, our resolutions will be backed by certain practices.\n\n\u201cAs a Parliament we are not going to rest on the resolutions, we are going to go further to lobby the various heads of state to play parliamentary diplomacy even outside the sub region with other international bodies to see the need to come to the aid of Nigeria. We have to go beyond resolutions even though that is our traditional practice.\n\n\u201cBecause the situation is so dire, the parliament will ensure that we move it further with the support of all stakeholders because if it goes bad it goes bad for everybody. It is time to add flesh to the bones of resolutions we normally passed.\u201d\n\nHe warned that if the Nigerian security situation is allowed to deteriorate, it could spill over into other countries in the region that may find it difficult to contain the influx of refugees from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens in Nigeria because of numbers alone no other country will be able to accommodate Nigerians, so there is an urgent need not to allow the crisis in Nigeria to spill over. Nigeria is so central not only to West Africa but to Africa. So, we must create the urgent need for support and suggestions that we can bring to the table, we need diplomacy to bring groups together because together we sink or we rise,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, an expert in international law and development, Livingstone Wechie, doubted the capacity of ECOWAS institutions to address the Nigerian conundrum, stressing that it is self-inflicted and leaves ECOWAS with little options more so when the West Africa institutions still struggle to establish systems and structures to tame such ugly security situations in member countries.\n\nHe said \u201cthe bane of Africa today is that none of the regional bodies have been vested with powers to penalise a sovereign state unlike what is obtainable in the European Union (EU) where their Community Laws and Courts are superior to those of member States.\u201d\n\nHe however said that \u201cIf African States and their regional institutions must get the type of results that they desire to fight insecurity and achieve stability, it must be by a deliberate commitment to a democratic model law making process and application of democratic norms in their affairs.\u201d",

T.B. Joshua was born in the small town of Arigidi in Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria, on June 12, 1963, after spending 15 months in his mother\u2019s womb.\n\n2. He allegedly tried to join the Nigerian Army but was unable to do so because the train he was on broke down, leaving him stranded en route to the military academy.\n\n3. T.B. Joshua is a three-parent family. Evelyn Joshua, his wife, is his life partner. Serah Joshua, his elder daughter, graduated from the London School of Economics, and Promise Joshua,\n\n4. IrohinOdua, the first pan-Yoruba news outlet, once named him the \u201cYoruba man of the decade.\u201d\n\n5. His television station, Emmanuel TV, has increased the visibility of his ministry, attracting an increasing number of foreigners from all over the world to his weekly church services.\n\n6. He is frequently dogged by controversies, owing to the nature of the illnesses and afflictions he is said to have cured and delivered people from. He\u2019s also recognized for his forecasts and predictions.\n\n7. In 2014, a guesthouse on his church grounds collapsed, killing approximately 115 South Africans.\n\n8. Did you know he\u2019s a published author as well? T.B. Joshua wrote and published The Mirror, The Step Between You And The Cure, Daily Time With God, and What The Future Holds, among other works.\n\n9. He\u2019s a well-known philanthropist, for example. He has a history of giving money, food, and other material presents to the destitute and disadvantaged that come to his church. According to a Forbes blogger, TB Joshua has spent around $20 million on charitable efforts.\n\n10. In 45 minutes, he proposed to his wife, Evelyn Joshua.",

Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.",

All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government announced an \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d of Twitter operations in Nigeria on Friday.\n\nBy early Saturday, users across the country started to experience difficulties in accessing the service and many resorted to using Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nThe decision to suspend Twitter has been criticised by many, but the Presidency in its Saturday statement insisted it was a justified move\n\n\u201c. . . the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\u201d\n\nThe tweet deleted by Twitter had referenced the Nigerian civil war, in which millions of Igbo died, many due to starvation.\n\nPresident Buhari had threatened to deal with IPOB \u201cin the language they understand\u201d, a statement many interpreted as a repeat of the civil war injustices meted out to Igbos.\n\nIPOB is a group, proscribed by a Nigerian court, seeking secession of a chunk of Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact,\u201d Mr. Shehu\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u201cA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen the President said that they will be treated \u2018in a language they understand,\u2019 he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA consultant anatomic and forensic pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa on Saturday told the Lagos state judicial panel on restitution for victims of SARS related abuses and other matters, that the coroners office conducted post mortem autopsies on 99 bodies between the October 20 and 27.\n\nProf Obafunwa made this disclosure while testifying with a view to assist the panel in its investigation of the October 20 Lekki toll gate shootings.\n\nThe pathologist, who was involved in coroner services through the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Lagos State, said the 99 bodies were picked up from different locations by officers of the Lagos State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit, LASEHMU.\n\nOf these 99 bodies, the pathologist said that only three were identified as victims of the Lekki shootings.\n\nHe proceeded to speak to the post mortem report and the cause of death of each of the three victims, all male.\n\nThe witness also played a video evidence detailing the extent of injury suffered by the deceased and the cause of death.\n\nAccording to the witness, the first body of an unknown victim simply identified as number 005, EndSARS/Yaba/2020 and brought in from Lekki bridge, on October 24 by the Lagos state government agency showed a fracture, a laceration on the left side of the skull and a body that was already decomposing.\n\nThe pathologist gave the cause of death as \u201ca result of bleeding into the chest cavity, following a blunt force trauma to the chest.\u201d\n\nAccording to the witness, the second body , \u201c041 unknown identity\u201d, was said to have died at about 1.45am on October 21; he was taken to Reddington hospital Lekki in an unconscious state as a result of open skull fracture, an attempt to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead after which he was taken to LASUTH on November 1 for post mortem.\n\n\u201cX-ray conducted prior to touching the body showed no bullet or pellets in the body,\u201d the witness said. \u201cThe x-ray revealed multiple skull fracture. Autopsy showed there was a ragged laceration running from the left side to the right side of the skull, further exploration of the wound showed bleeding into the scalp, multiple fracture of the skull, bleeding into the brain tissue. In the chest, there was bruises of the anterior, fracture of the left rib.\n\n\u201cGenerally the internal organs were pale and it suggested there was severe blood loss. Hypertensive heart disease, upon examination under the microscope and samples for DNA, death was as a result of skull and brain injury which was due to blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nThe third case, identified as \u201c062 unknown identity\u201d, was also said to have died at Lekki tollgate. The body was said to have been taken to the General Hospital Yaba and autopsy was conducted on November 2. Cause of death was said to be severe blood loss as a result of disruption of major blood vessel, caused as a result of gun shot injury.\n\nCounsel to some of the #EndSars Protesters, Olumide Fusika, however faulted the testimony that only three of the 99 bodies were related to the Lekki shootings.\n\nHe made an application that the witness be required to produce details of all 99 bodies to enable him fully conduct his cross examination of the pathologist.\n\nCounsel to the Lagos State Government, Olukayode Enitan objected to the granting of the application.\n\nHe noted that the summons which commanded the attendance of the witness at the panel required him to give reports of incidents of October 20, which occurred at the Lekki toll gate with a view to assisting the panel.\n\nFor him, anything outside this will amounted to inviting the panel to go beyond its terms of reference and the instruments setting it up and this will be tantamount to acting ultra vires. He urged the panel to refuse the application.\n\nAfter taking submissions from other lawyers in the matter, the panel chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi noted that though it would take a lot of the panel\u2019s time to sit through looking at 96 more bodies, she would bow to the majority decision of the lawyers.\n\nThe panel then ordered the pathologist, Prof Obafunwa to produce the records and autopsy reports of the remaining 96 bodies.\n\nFurther proceedings on the matter were adjourned to June 19.",

          "text": "Editors in Nigeria have called on the federal government to immediately reconsider the suspension of operations of Twitter as the move projects the Nigerian government as a dictatorship.\n\nThe editors under the aegis of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) described the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet and called on the Nigerian government to seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the microblogging company.\n\nThe Nigerian editors stated this in a statement on Saturday and noted that the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\n\u201cAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said that the action is an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violates the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform,\u201d the statement signed by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) read.\n\n\u2018\u2019In addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week.\n\n\u2018\u2019If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u2019\u2019, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying this ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u2018\u2019Certainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens\u2019\u2019, the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u2019\u2019, the Guild said,\n\nThe Guild therefore called on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
