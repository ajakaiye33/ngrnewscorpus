          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nALL Progressives Congress, APC, National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday, denied endorsing or asking anyone to step down as local government chairman or councillorship aspirant on the platform of the APC in the July 22 council polls in Lagos.\n\nSpeaking to reporters shortly after the South-West APC briefed the press on the state of the nation, Tinubu asked those interested in contesting the local council polls to follow APC\u2019s guidelines and pursue their aspirations.\n\nIn a statement by his media office, Tinubu said: \u201cThe Lagos APC Governance Advisory Council, GAC, meeting of Friday, May 21, 2021, discussed ways to ensure the fairness of the party primaries for the polls.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, people intent on sowing discord and undermining democracy within the party have begun to spread lies and rumours that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the GAC have a list of preferred candidates for the upcoming primary elections and that the party will skew the primaries to benefit these people. We state, categorically that, there is no such list nor are there any plans to influence the primaries in any manner. These stories are false and mere-spirited attempts to hurt the party.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu would like it to be known, by way of this statement, that he has no preferred candidates for the upcoming local government primaries. He has no intention to endorse any of the people contesting for the party nomination in any election, whether for chairmanship or councillorship positions. \u201cOn this matter, Asiwaju believes he can speak for the rest of the GAC regarding their belief in the impartiality and transparency of the internal party process.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu and the other GAC leaders seek a free, fair and transparent process in which the candidates who emerge are those who gather the most support among the party rank and file. Only in this manner, do we best prepare ourselves for the general election.\n\n\u201cThe APC Constitution directs that the party\u2019s candidates should emerge through direct or indirect primaries or by consensus. In order to reduce tension and avoid discord and in-fighting, aspirants should embrace consensus wherever possible.\n\n\u201cHowever, where consensus is not possible, fair and clean primaries must be held so that party members have a chance to choose the candidate they want from among the competing aspirants. All aspirants, however, must realize that only one person can win any given contest. While we encourage everyone to compete with zeal and energy, we encourage all aspirants and party members to respect the results of our primaries. Once the primaries end, we must unite as a party so that we win the general elections thereby ensuring the continuity of progressive governance at the local government level throughout the state.\n\n\u201cIn this vein, Asiwaju appeals to party leaders in all the local governments to allow democracy to flourish. He urges them to do everything humanly possible to protect and promote the democratic process.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu\u2019s interest is in a free, fair and peaceful process. He has no preferred candidate in the primaries. In the Lagos APC, democracy not devious rumors must be allowed to flourish.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

May the Almighty Allah grant them eternal rest. Amin.\u2019\u2019\n\n5 generals on consideration for COAS replacement\n\nAlso, indications emerged weekend that five major Generals were being considered to replace the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru.\n\nSources told Vanguard that because there is no vacuum in the military and due to the fact the unfortunate crash occurred during weekend, the next COAS might by appointed by the Commander-in- Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari, latest Monday or Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a source in the military, the President already has five names that are being screened for the job, as all five had performed creditably in their current positions.\n\nThe list is said to include two serving General Officers Commanding, GOCs, a former Force Commander, Multi-National Joint Task Force, a Corps Commander and another Major-General and former GOC who was redeployed by the late COAS.\n\nThough the source declined giving more details that will narrow down the officers involved, Vanguard gathered that the Generals involved are Course 37 and 38 officers because by statute, since late General Attahiru was Course 35, his seniors are expected to either retire or get redeployed to Defence headquarters.\n\nOn assumption of office as Chief of Army Staff, many of former COAS (Lt. Gen Tukur Buratai\u2019s) course mates and seniors to General Ibrahim Attahiru were either retired or redeployed to the Defence headquarters, or the Nigerian Army Resource Centre as directing staff/senior fellows.\n\nHowever, by tradition, the next most senior officer to the late Chief of Army Staff is the Chief of Policy and Plans, Nigerian Army, a position currently held being held by Major- General Benjamin Ahanotu from Anambra State. He superintended the burial ceremony of his former boss, Attahiru and is expected to act in the interim, pending appointment of a substantive Chief of Army Staff by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nReps shelve planned security summit\n\nSimilarly, the House of Representatives has postponed its security summit slated for Monday, in honour of late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and ten other military officers.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nAnnouncing the postponement through its clerk, Mr. Chinedu Akubueze, in a statement yesterday, the House said: \u201cThis is to inform the general public that the House of Representatives has postponed its national summit scheduled to hold from Monday, May 24, 2021, in honour of the late Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 other military officers and men that died as a result of air mishap on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe security summit will now kick off on Wednesday, May 26, 2021. The House shares in the grief and sorrow of the families of the late top military officers and prayed that the Almighty God will grant them eternal rest.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that the postponement became necessary as the late Army Chief was one of the major stakeholders that would have taken part in the summit. The House regrets any inconvenience the postponement may cause invited guests,\u201d a statement from the office of the Clerk stated.\n\nCAN youth wing declares 3-day mourning\n\nMeanwhile, the youth wing of Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has declared a three day mourning over the demise of Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru and other officers who died in a military plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nBelusochukwu Enwere, the national chairman of CAN\u2019s youth wing, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja yesterday. He also demanded an extensive inquest into military plane crash; describing the incident as a colossal loss to the nation.\n\nAccording to him, Attahiru and the other officers are heroes who gave their lives for the security of the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe entire Christian Youths in Nigeria are grieved by the death of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru and other military officers.\n\n\u201cAttahiru and the other officers are heroes who gave their lives for the security of our nation. The tragic incident is a colossal loss to Nigeria\n\n\u201cStarting from today (Sunday), we shall observe three days mourning for our fallen heroes. YOWICAN urges the Federal Government to do same because these men are risking their lives to secure our nation.\n\n\u201cAs we announce a three-day national mourning, we demand an extensive inquest into this military plane crash and must be followed to the last.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy too much to bear. Our country has passed the stage where military aircraft will crash like that and we call it normal.\n\n\u201cIn less than one year, two military aircraft crashed for nothing without solid investigations. This will surely affect the security of our nation and the war against insurgency, banditry, and kidnapping.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari must do something about this before it is too late. Who knows who is next? It could be the President, a governor, Senator, military officers or ordinary citizens.\n\n\u201cWe commiserate with the military high command, the families of Lt. General Attahiru and the other officers and men who have paid the supreme price for the security of our nation.\n\nWe pray God Almighty to give them the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nConcerned about the state of the nation, particularly the serious security challenges facing the country, All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in the South West met at Lagos House, Marina, yesterday.\n\nIn a communique read by former Interim National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, the leaders endorsed the resolutions of southern governors who met recently in Asaba, Delta State on restructuring, state police and the ban on open grazing.\n\nThey expressed their strong opposition to separatist agitations and hate speeches,while urging those indulging in such to desist forthwith, they equally renewed their belief in the unity, stability and sustainability of the country.\n\nThey also commiserated with President Muhammadu Buhari, the military authorities, families of the Chief of Army Staff and other officers who died, and indeed the entire nation over last Friday\u2019s tragic plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nThe communique read in part: \u201cWe noted with significant concern the security situation in the country. Terrorism and violent criminality threaten many areas, adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of too many innocent and peace-loving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhile mindful of the resource and other constraints facing the nation, we urge the Federal Government to continue to make the necessary expenditures and allocate sufficient resources to enable the military and security agencies to tackle the difficult security challenges confronting us. For Nigeria to overcome these challenges, we must do so with unity of purpose and action. The desire for peace and the chance for a prosperous and just society is universal and transcends all regional, religious or ethnic divisions.\n\n\u201cSadly, many public figures have made statements that sparked division and undermine the needed unity of purpose. We urge government at all levels, security agencies, and public leaders across the country to do everything possible to prevent tension so that we sustain the necessary unity to defeat these challenges to our national security. All responsible Nigerians must speak and act in a manner that strengthens our common cause against these common threats to our collective peace, justice and development.\n\n\u201cWe restate our abhorrence of violence as a means to achieve either political or economic power and influence. We strongly condemn violence of any form in any part of the country, regardless of ethnic or regional identity of the perpetrators of the violence or of the victims. Government must do all it can to protect potential victims and to assist those who have previously been victimised by terrorism or widespread banditry.\n\n\u201cWe hold to the view that true federalism where more power and resources are allocated to the states will be an essential part in strengthening society and improving democratic governance so that we beat the present challenges but also engender durable peace and security. True federalism and the reallocation of resources and authority that comes with it will empower the states to solve localised issues before they spread and transform into national ones.\n\n\u201cIn addition to mitigating political competition for control of the national government, greater federalism will empower grassroots economic development and political reforms that will stand as bulwarks against the terrorism and criminality now experienced in too many parts of the nation. A hallmark of this enhanced federalism will be the establishment of state police forces.\n\n\u201c We endorse the position of the Southern Governors taken at their May 11, 2021 summit in Asaba, Delta State, regarding ranching. We do so because such a decision will lessen tensions between farmers and herders while also helping the long-term economic viability of both the farming and herding communities. We are mindful of the short-term dislocation this might cause but are also mindful that this position is in the best interests of all parties concerned. We, therefore, recommend that the federal and state governments cooperate fully with each other to enact the necessary measures to encourage this more effective and modern method of cattle-rearing so that both farmers and herders can pursue their livelihoods with greater productivity and in a more cooperative relationship that minimizes the friction between these two important pillars of our agricultural economy.\n\nAt the event, National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu said he had no favourite candidates for the forthcoming Lagos State local government election.\n\n\u201cI would like to be known that I have no preferred candidates for the upcoming local government primaries. I have no\n\nintention to endorse any of the people contesting for the party nomination in any election, whether for chairmanship or councillorship positions,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaker, House of Representatives, Femi Ggajabiamila was at the meeting.Three governors were also present: Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos: Dapo Abiodun, Ogun; Gboyega Oyetola, Osun. Others were the National Leader of APC, Bola Tinubu; Chief Segun Osoba; Minister of Trade and Industry, Chief Niyi Adebayo; Gen Akinriade Alami (retd).",

Governor Akeredolu stands by a virile, united and indivisible Nigeria as demanded by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum. Therefore, the vigour, zeal, leadership and candour displayed by Governor Akeredolu for a just and fair Nigeria is altruistic and borne out of patriotism for the nation as well as love for his people, the Yoruba ethnic nationality.

Negotiation means you give and take. In fact, right now, Nigeria is up for negotiation. I think that is where different groups come in to make their demands.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the nation is in danger and whatever anybody can do to prevent the worse, they should do it. There must be a way that we can save ourselves from self destruction. We cannot continue like this. Very few people are happy with the status quo. If we do not talk, we might end up killing one another.\u201d\n\nThe cleric also accused the National Assembly of neglecting its duties, stating that the role of the National Assembly is to discuss pressing issues plaguing the peace of the nation and to find possible solutions.\n\n\u201cUnder normal circumstances, it is the National Assembly that should handle these kind of things. The system is set up so that the National Assembly can challenge the government. But we have reached a situation where we have a National Assembly that is proud to be a rubber stamp. Somehow every member of that House has remained silent. We realise that there is no difference between the political parties;whether PDP or APC, nobody complains. Which means the things that are serious are not discussed.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have reached a stage in Nigeria where we cannot trust politicians. TIV land, where are your politicians, what are they saying? What are the issues that they talk about in political gatherings? Are they blind to the fact that there\u2019s a bigger thing than who will win the next election?\u201d\n\nDuring the visit, the chairman, TPG, Prof. Zachary Gundu, alleged that the army, sometimes, supported the herdsmen attacks, as they look the other way instead of protecting the people.\n\nGundu, who described the Fulani livestock trade as a Trojan horse used to masquerade the true intentions of the herders, explained that the Fulani are merely riding on the back of the cow to grab land at the expense of indigenous crop farmers for the Fulani of the whole world.\n\n\u201cWe want the return of displaced people to their ancestral lands and full compensation be paid to those who have lost lives and property.

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nOperatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a Brazil based drug kingpin, Ejiofor Enwereaku, and also intercepted 36 blocks of cocaine, weighing 27.95 kilogrammes with a street value of over N8billion at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nThe drug lord, who leads a syndicate, was arrested at the airport, on Friday, May, 14, 2021, for importing 27.95kg of cocaine using their organised criminal gang, which specialises in tagging/planting drugs in innocent travellers\u2019 luggage.\n\nA statement by the Director Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, yesterday, said based on intelligence, narcotic agents at the MMIA had, on Saturday May 8, 2021, intercepted a bag that arrived the Lagos airport from GRU, Brazil via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the Ethiopian airline with baggage tag No- ET331199, but was disclaimed by an arriving passenger on the flight. The disclaimed bag was promptly secured by NDLEA operatives for investigation.\n\nOn Sunday, May 9, 2021, a man came to the airport to make inquiry on how to get the disclaimed bag released. He was promptly arrested for investigation.\n\nThe disclaimed bag was opened in the presence of the arriving passenger and the man who came to negotiate the release of the disputed bag. When it was opened, it was found that the bag contained 36 blocks of cocaine, weighing 27.95kg. A follow up sting operation was carried out, which led to the arrest of Ejiofor Felix Enwereaku, the prime suspect, on Friday, May 14, upon his arrival from Addis Ababa onboard Ethiopian airline.\n\nDuring preliminary interrogation after his arrest, he confessed to have been contracted by his Ethiopian associate, who is a notorious drug baron, to claim and push out the consignment in Lagos, Nigeria. He further admitted to have paid the $24,500 bribe in three tranches to compromise NDLEA officers. The first was $10,000 delivered through his representative in Lagos and another $10, 000 via his First Bank account, while the third tranche of $4,500 was paid at the point of his arrest.\n\nHis group is suspected to be responsible for recruiting traffickers to move illicit drugs to various destinations, using Nigeria as their transit location and also planting drugs in the luggage of innocent travellers.\n\nImpressed by the outcome of the intelligence-led operational strategies that took weeks of painstaking efforts and closely monitored by him, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. General Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), commended the Commander, MMIA Command of the agency, Ahmadu Garba, his officers and men for their diligence and resilience in following up every lead in the case until the kingpin was successfully entrapped and arrested.\n\n\u201cI have warned that we\u2019ll, henceforth, not only go after the traffickers, but, with the same vigour, target the cartels and the kingpins that operate them; the latest arrest is a clear confirmation that we\u2019ll match our words with action, and that we\u2019ll come for those who will not back out of the criminal trade, wherever they are hiding, pushing instruments of death through our borders, to destroy the lives of our youths,\u201d Gen. Marwa stated.",

          "text": "\u2022Says govs\u2019 recommendation anti-people\n\nOur Reporters\n\nThe organised labour at the weekend cautioned the National Economic Council (NEC) against approving a recommendation by the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) seeking a N385 pump price for petrol.\n\nState affiliates of the organised labour, in separate interviews with THISDAY, said doing so will unleash hardships on the people and heat up the polity.\n\nTheir warning came ahead of a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), scheduled for Abuja tomorrow, to deliberate on the issue.\n\nThe 36 governors, under the auspices of the NGF, at a meeting last week, had endorsed the N385 per litre pump price recommended by a committee set up by NEC, and headed by the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nHowever, the recommendation is subject to approval by NEC, chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nAlthough the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, had at the weekend allayed fears of an increase in petrol price, the various states\u2019 chapters of the labour unions vowed to resist the proposed price regime, if approved.\n\nReacting to the governors\u2019 proposal, the Chairman of the Niger State chapter of the NLC, Mr. Yakubu Garba, told THISDAY at the weekend that there would be a \u201cgreat revolt across the country if the pump price of petrol is increased to N385 per litre as proposed by the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum\u201d.\n\nGarba stated that the workers would resist the proposed price, as the proposal by the governors is not only anti-workers but also anti-people.\n\nAccording to him, the position of the \u201cstate NLC is the same with that of the national leadership of the congress, which is that government should make the refineries work.\n\n\u201cWhen the refineries are functional, they will serve two purposes \u2013 local supply of fuel will be adequate and at the right price, in addition to the country generating a lot of income from the export of petroleum products\u201d.\n\nGarba added that many Nigerians would also be employed.\n\nHe urged the NEC to reject the proposal by the governors, as approving it will heat up the nation.\n\nThe Sokoto State chapter of NLC said it would resist any attempt by the federal government to accept the proposal of state governors to increase the pump price to N385 against the current N165.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, the chairman of the council in the state, Mr. Aminu Umar Ahmad, wondered why the state governors who were supposed to care for the welfare of the citizens would sit down to take such a \u201cheinous decision.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me tell you; I\u2019m disappointed at the action and attitude of the governors in taking such a decision that has adverse effects on the people.\u201d\n\nUmar added that the proposal by the governors would never see the light of the day, as labour will fight it with the last drop of their blood.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of NLC in Zamfara State, Mr. Sani Magajinrafinya, told THISDAY that: \u201cThe action of the governors is a betrayal of public trust.\u201d\n\nSani urged the governors to look beyond crude oil and diversify their states\u2019 sources of internally generated revenue.\n\nHe also stated that labour will use all arsenal at its disposal to resist any attempt to increase petrol pump price.\n\nHe confirmed that the NLC executive will meet tomorrow to deliberate on the matter.\n\nAlso, in his reaction, the Chairman of NLC in Kebbi State, Mr. Umar Halidu Hassan, said the action of the governors was a breach of agreement they entered with their people.\n\n\u201cI think the governors were not in the right mood when they took this decision,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, any attempt to implement the proposal will trigger a nationwide industrial crisis.\n\nAlso, the Oyo State Chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Mr. Emmanuel Ogundiran, said the union would resist the proposed increment of price of petrol to N385 per litre.\n\nOgundiran told THISDAY that the governors have continued to constitute themselves into anti-workers and anti-people group by throwing up policies that would further impoverish Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the NGF is not known to the Nigerian constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I am very sure of is that labour would not sit idly and accept this from the governors.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the state Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Kayode Martins, said the union would not support such increment in the price of petrol.\n\nHe described the governors as enemies of the country who do not care about the hardship Nigerians are facing daily.\n\nHe stated that the position of the national leadership of the union would be binding on the state chapter.\n\nAkwa Ibom State chapter of the NLC also rejected the proposal by the governors, saying it will not see the light of the day.\n\nThe state Chairman of NLC, Mr. Sunny James, told THISDAY that \u201cthere is no way we could accept such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNLC is the only hope of a common man at the moment in the country. It is totally unacceptable to allow the governors to slam that kind of hardship on the workers.\n\n\u201cThey have the right to take their decision, but we will not allow them to implement such a thing. We are waiting for a directive from the national body. We are going to have an NLC executive meeting to look at all the situations in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso in an interview with THISDAY, the Nasarawa State Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Yusuf Sarki Iyah, described the governors\u2019 proposal as unfortunate.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me use this medium to describe this call by the governors as an unfortunate call. It is uncalled for at this moment when the impact of COVID-19 pandemic is still biting hard on the citizens of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIya stated that there would be a national executive council meeting of the NLC tomorrow to discuss the petrol price increase proposal by the governors.\n\nThe Enugu State chapter of the NLC has also rejected the governors\u2019 proposal.\n\nThe state Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Virginus Nwobodo, said the national leadership of the union had summoned a meeting for tomorrow for the various organs of the congress to take a position.\n\nHe said it would not be easy for the governors to achieve their aim because they would not be the only ones to make inputs about petrol deregulation and increase in price of the product.\n\nThe first Vice Chairman of the Kwara State chapter of NLC, Alhaji Murtala Saheed Olayinka, told THISDAY in Ilorin that the planned fuel price hike would bring untold hardship to the workers and Nigerians, adding that the union will not support it.\n\nHe said labour would resist such move so as to avoid any burden on the average workers.\n\n\u201cI want to also say that even if the payment of minimum wage is implemented for workers today, the hike in fuel prices would not bring new lease of life to us and the entire Nigerians,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Chairman of the TUC in Ekiti State, Mr. Sola Adigun, said that the proposed full deregulation of the petrol sector could only take off when the refineries started working at optimal capacity.\n\nAdigun\u2019s counterpart in the NLC, Kolapo Olatunde, stated that governors\u2019 proposal can\u2019t be implemented at this time when the people are groaning under harsh economic condition.\n\nHe told THISDAY in Ado Ekiti that though the body backs full deregulation through absolute removal of the corruption-laden petrol subsidy, such a decision could only be enforced when refineries are working at optimal capacity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are making it clear and as directed by our national leadership that we will resist implementation of new pump price regime, if our refineries are still moribund.\u201d\n\nOlatunde, who spoke through the union\u2019s Secretary, Eunice Akinyemi, said increasing the pump price to as high as N385 as mulled by the governors would foist on Nigerians dehumanising economic conditions.\n\nAlso reacting, the Ebonyi State chapter of the NLC described the proposed new pump price of fuel as a scam and unacceptable.\n\nThe Chairman of the state NLC, Ikechukwu Nwafor, told THISDAY that the governors\u2019 proposal was dead on arrival, as labour would mobilise all strategies to scuttle it.\n\nNwafor said: \u201cWe will not only protest on the streets, there are many strategies that NLC will deploy to ensure the proposal is completely scuttled. The new proposal is a scam and not acceptable. We have said it that there is no justification for the past new pump price.\u201d\n\nHowever, Leonard Noah, who is the factional chairman of the state NLC, recognised by the state government, said he would only implement the directives of the national body.\n\nThe Chairman of the NLC in Ondo State, Mr. Sunday Adeleye, told THISDAY that the state NLC was already discussing with the national headquarters, adding that a meeting has been called for tomorrow.\n\nSimilarly, the state Chairman of the TUC, Helen Odofun, told THISDAY that any increase in fuel price would affect the economy.\n\n\u201cNigerians have been impoverished already and any attempt to further make life difficult for them shall be resisted,\u201d she added.\n\nAlso, the Chairman of NLC in Abia State, Uchenna Obigwe, condemned the recommendation by the governors.\n\n\u201cIt is not the best policy and not in the interest of ordinary Nigerians who are already impoverished by government,\u201d he said, adding that it will lead to astronomical increase in the prices of goods and services.\n\nThe Kaduna State Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Ayuba Suleiman, while reacting to the governors\u2019 proposal, told THISDAY that \u201cit is just a proposal and it is not yet approved. The federal government has also come out to say that it does not intend to increase anything.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC also said it is only the federal government that can ask them to increase petroleum price not governors. The NLC is going to meet on Tuesday on the matter and a press statement will be issued on the matter. So you have to wait for the statement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chairman of Edo State Chapter of the NLC, Mr. Sunny Osayande, said the branch would wait for outcome of negotiation between its national secretariat.\n\n\u201cI know our national leadership is tackling the matter with both the federal government on the proposed increase by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF),\u201d he said.\n\nThe state Chairman of TUC, Marshal Ohue, said TUC at the national level was handling the issue.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the NLC in Katsina State, Dr. Hussain Hamisu Yanduna, told THISDAY that the federal government had no intention to increase petrol price to N385 as proposed by the governors.\n\n\u201cGovernment has said it very clear that they have no intention to increase the price of the petrol,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria lost at least 52 million barrels of crude oil between May and December 2020 to COVID-19-induced compulsory supply cuts imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), according to a data by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production level before the curbs was two million barrels per day (bpd), recent data from NNPC indicated that while the average daily crude oil production for the entire year stood at 1.775 million bpd, total production for the whole year was 704.741 million barrels.\n\nIn January, the country recorded the highest production level of 2.072 million bpd while last December, NNPC recorded its lowest production of 1.419 bpd.\n\nOn the average, the difference in production of crude oil between January and December, 2020, for instance was 652,967 barrels, that is, the highest and lowest production levels.\n\nAlthough the document did not separate the quantity of crude oil produced from condensates, with a 225,000 bpd approximate under-production, at least 6.75 million bpd of crude oil was shut in to comply with the oil cartel\u2019s agreement.\n\nThe figures showed that NNPC fulfilled its pledge to rev up production to hit its targeted three million litres, when the pandemic broke out, slashing average daily production to 1.74 million barrels in the first instance in May after the OPEC intervention.\n\nIn June, production further reduced to 1.68 million barrels per day on the average, 1.65 million bpd in July and 1.64 million bpd in August.\n\nFollowing the virus-induced plunge in oil prices, OPEC and its allies known as OPEC+ in May last year, embarked on the largest coordinated oil production cut regime in history, agreeing to cut 9.7 million bpd in an effort to support the market, amounting to about 10 per cent of global oil supply.\n\nHowever, according to the data from NNPC\u2019s market and production activities, in September, oil drilling further dipped to 1.59 million bpd, but slightly increased to 1.61 million bpd in October before falling again in November to 1.54 million and tumbling in December to 1.419 million barrels.\n\nIn all, the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) portion of the total national output took the lion\u2019s share of oil drilled in 2020, hitting 281.1 million barrels of the total 704.7 million barrels of crude oil produced during the year.\n\nThe Joint Venture (JV) agreements yielded 226.5 million barrels, while the Alternative Financing (AF) sources resulted in the production of 75.2 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, the activities of the National Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an NNPC subsidiary, yielded 72 million barrels in the year under consideration, while the independent marginal fields generated 49.6 million barrels in 2020.\n\nThe figures reflect the huge impact the outbreak of the virus had on the international oil market and the efforts by OPEC to curb output to rein in the falling prices, which early last year tumbled to about $10 for Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, while West Texas Intermediate (WTO), America\u2019s benchmark reeled in the negative territory.\n\nAlso, national gas production was 1.93 bcf from JV, 593mmcf from PSC, 440mmcf from NPDC, totalling a production of 2.9 bcf during the year.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the NNPC had set a target of three million bpd oil production, with the Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, stating that the drilling of Kolmani River III well was already ongoing, with a high prospect of finding oil.\n\nThe corporation also said seismic data collection was ongoing in the Bida Basin as well as re-launching of exploration work in the Chad Basin, while several alternative funding facilities had been secured for the NPDC to facilitate the development of additional assets.\n\nBut that did not materialise as contrary to the projection, the corporation and its partners embarked upon shutting down several platforms to ramp up compliance with the OPEC cuts, which has led to some price stability in the international oil market.\n\nThe NNPC report also revealed that the NPDC December 2019 to December 2020 cumulative production from all fields totalled 72,029,656 barrels of crude oil, translating to an average daily production of 181,435 barrels per day.\n\nIn addition, at an average oil price of $50.78/barrel and exchange rate of N379/$ at the time, the domestic crude oil lifted by NNPC was valued at $382.8 million or a naira equivalent of N145,094,050,521.81 for last December.\n\nThe remaining crude oil lifted for export was valued at $24.3 million at an average price of $48.92/barrel, with the total value of crude oil lifted on the account of NNPC in December 2020 being about $407.1 million.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nWith Friday\u2019s death of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, in an air crash in Kaduna, the race for who succeeds him has begun in earnest.\n\nThe appointment of the chief of army staff is the prerogative of the president.\n\nAlthough there are speculations that the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Maj. Gen. Danjuma Ali-Keffi, had been appointed in acting capacity, military authorities yesterday declined to speak on the matter.\n\nHowever, a report by an online newspaper, PRNigeria, gathered that Ali-Keffi was not among the most senior officers in the army.\n\nSources said he had more than 30 senior officers to contend with.\n\nMany names have come up as likely successors, including the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP), Major General Bernard Ahanotu, a member of Course 35; Major General J. Sarham, a former General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division and a former Commandant, Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), a member of Course 36 but originally Course 35 and Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Minna, Major General A.S. Maikobi, a member of Course 36.\n\nIt was gathered that the trio are experienced senior officers in the army.\n\nAhanotu, who is from Anambra State, was the Chief of Staff, 21 Armoured Brigade, Maiduguri, who led the operation that arrested Boko Haram founder, Mohammed Yusuf, and handed him over to the police before he was killed.\n\nAhanotu was also Commander, 3rd Armoured Brigade, Jos, that led the operation that rescued kidnapped Dapchi girls. He was also a GOC.\n\nSome of other senior and experienced military officers, it was learnt, include: Major General A.M. Aliyu of Regular Course 36 from Gombe State who is another operation officer. He is the Chief of Administration of the Nigerian Army and former Director Foreign Liaison at the Defence Agency.\n\nHe was responsible for processing actionable intelligence for military operations.\n\nAnother officer is Major General Ibrahim Manu Yusuf of Regular Course 37 from Yobe State.\n\nHe is Chief of Operation and former Force Commander Multinational Joint Taskforce (MNJTF). He was also a General Officer Commanding 7 Division with rich experience in the counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations in the North-east and have also taught in many military colleges, including National Defence College (NDC), Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), and Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre (NAPKC), Jaji.\n\nMajor General Faruk Yahaya of Regular Course 37 is from Zamfara State. He is the current Theatre Commander Operation in the North-east and former General Officer Commanding Officer of the 1 Division of the Nigerian Army.\n\nIt was further gathered that there are also other senior operational officers worthy of considerations.\n\nThe snag, however, for Maikobi and Sarham are from Kano State, where the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, hails from.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the utmost consideration in the appointment of an army chief is operational and intelligence experience, especially when the nation is in a state of war.\n\n\u201cThe president also needs to appoint somebody within the range of the most senior officers in order to command the respect of other service chiefs and commanders.\n\n\u201cAhanotu is Course 35, Sarham and Maikobi are Course 36. If for instance you give it to someone in Course 37, you will disfigure the system because most people, who are not even due for retirement will have to go\u201d a security analyst, who spoke anonymously, said.\n\n\u201cAli-Keffi is of 38 regular course. If you give him, you are sending many generals home who are not due to go.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of this if it is true, is that it will force these brilliant officers to retire at a period we need more hands in the prosecution of diverse operations across the country. I don\u2019t think we need such mass retirement now,\u201d the security expert added.\n\nHowever, a top military officer said some factors would be considered for the appointment of service chiefs beyond seniority.\n\n\u201cYou know the President has the discretion to appoint anyone he so wishes with advice or probably a nomination from the Minister of Defence.\n\n\u201cApart from seniority in service, officers so considered must have been grounded in military operations and intelligence,\u201d the officer said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer.

What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "App review \u2013 How does Bitnob work?",
          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nObservers in aviation industry note that in February, a military aircraft crashed near Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, in which seven person died.\n\nThey recalled that in 2021 alone, we had three crashes associated with the military \u2014 in Feb, 27, March 31 and the third one was in May 21.\n\nAn aviation consultant has also observed that there has been an increase in the number of plane crashes and victims in recent times.\n\nAviation consultant retired Group Capt. John Ojikutu, therefore, identified some gaps that could have caused the recent plane crashes.\n\nOjikutu said that the nation\u2019s airports had had some deficiencies in terms of safety equipment over the years that might have led to crashes.\n\nHe said that weather had been one of the major causes of most of the crashes in the country, such as the ADC and Sosoliso crashes in 2005 and 2006.\n\nOn the crash of NAF Beachcraft that killed the Chief of Army Staff and 10 others, he said that the statement by the Chief of Defence Staff indicated that inclement weather was responsible.\n\nHe observed that one of the problems that led to the accidents in 2005, 2006 was also as a result of inclement weather.\n\n\u201cThat was the thing that caused the crash of ADC in Abuja and Sosoliso in Port Harcourt and other one like that.\n\n\u201cIt was the wind shear and the government put in money to install wind shear system in all international airports.\n\n\u201cI think if I am not making mistake, somewhere along he line, all airports were installed with wind shear system.\n\n\u201cThe question I keep asking everyday is do we have proper periodic maintenance of these equipment because these are seasonal incidents that have to do with weather.\n\n\u201cThis happens at low level and it happens when you are about to land or about to take off along the approach path.\n\n\u201cI also read that the said aircraft was diverted from military to civilian airport because there must have been a weather issue and I am sure that military airport there has wind shear system.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that are we sure the wind shear system in Kaduna airport is working,?\u201d he asked.\n\nWind shear, sometimes referred to as wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere.\n\nOjikutu said that the recent bird strike incidents was also worrisome.\n\nHe alleged that equipment were procured for bird strike to some airports, especially in Lagos sometimes in 2006 or 2007.\n\nHe alleged further that there were concerns about whether or not those equipment were still functional.\n\nThe expert also spoke on the need for proper oversight on the air worthiness of aircraft and safety of the airport where aircraft are landing.\n\nBut a security expert, Dr Kabir Adamu, Managing Director, Beacon Consulting Ltd. Abuja, pleaded with the federal government to evaluate the nation\u2019s airport and it fleets to ascertain their current state.\n\nAdamu noted that it had become imperative due to the incessant plane crashes in the country.\n\nThe expert decried the current state of the nation\u2019s airports, particularly the fleets and the condition of service for the pilots.\n\nAccording to him, once the evaluation is carried out, then the authorities or the agencies involved can actually know the actual cause of the frequent crashes.\n\n\u201cWith this, the authority involved can now come to the conclusion whether the challenges need to be addressed immediately, or to ground all the aircraft.\n\n\u201cHowever, globally, there are three or four reasons that are attributed to air crashes in any part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt can be mechanical, human error, act of nature and shot down as a result of hostile activities.\n\n\u201cThis is usually associated with conflict areas where there malicious act of certain individual or group.\n\n\u201cSo, whether the regulatory body released report or not, these four areas are the likely consequences.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, only a thorough investigation will reveal which of these is more frequent in the country because we do not have the technology to determine what the reasons are immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert recalled that in 2021 alone, we had three crashes associated with the military on Feb, 27, March 31 and the third one was in May 21.\n\n\u201cHowever, given the frequency, it is absolutely important that an investigation is conducted.\n\n\u201cIf the reason is poor maintenance, then it means it is an internal thing and the military needs to deal with that urgently.\n\n\u201cIf on the other hand, it is something that has to do with the pilots\u2019 capabilities, then that should be taken up by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF).\n\n\u201cAt the same time, if it is maintenance, then what type of equipment is there at the airport and are they of international standard\u201d?\n\nHe, however, expressed optimism that if the country could carry out a thorough evaluation of the airports and its fleets, it would go a long way in addressing the frequent air crashes in the country.\n\nSimilarly, Nigerians from different walks of life has urged the government to invest more on training and retraining of the nation\u2019s pilots locally and internationally, to check plane crashes.\n\nIn reactions to Friday\u2019s aircrash that claimed the lives of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other security personnel in Kaduna.\n\nMr Adekunle Makinde, the Former National Chairman, the Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, said that there was an urgent need for the training and retraining of the country\u2019s flight officers.\n\n\u201dHonestly, the crash is becoming one two many and it speaks badly about the fight against insurgency. This is not good for the military.\n\n\u201cThe implication is very bad concerning the military, I think this is the time to look inward and find out what is happening to our men, what is happening concerning our equipment; could this be man-made error, equipment error or engine fault.\n\n\u201dThere is need too, to invest more in the training of our men, locally and internationally.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring in the people to train them, or send them outside the country, for more exposure and training.\n\n\u201cLet us engage in training the trainers for our men.\n\n\u201cAlso, we need to regularly evaluate the fitness of our pilots, psychologically and mentally,\u201d he said.\n\nMakinde stated that the development was particularly sad because the country has lost its very best hands, who were at the peak of their careers.\n\n\u201cWe have lost our Chief of Army Staff, who was contributing a lot to the fight against the insurgency, he had been doing a lot since he assumed office,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his view, Mr Ovie Edomi, Publisher and Editor-In-Chief, South South International Magazine, urged the federal government to ensure recruitment of sound professionals in air travel.\n\n\u201cFor a country\u2019s military to experience three air clashes in three months, it implies that the military high command needs to look at so many things including the theory of conspiracy, lack of maintenance and inadequate funding.\n\n\u201cThough, l am not an aviation expert, l know from my years of flying that a twin-engine aircraft is not designed to just fail and crash.\n\n\u201dThey should check their fuel suppliers and maintenance engineers thoroughly,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Mr Mohammed Sodipo, Chairman Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Badagry Chapter, said \u201cthe solution is simple; all the country needs is justice, equality and fairness.\n\n\u201dWe need an incorruptible and courageous judicial system.\n\n\u201cWe also need upright and selfless leaders, as well as orientation of the public on good leadership and followership\u201d.\n\n_______________________________\n\nA News Analysis by News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n...",

          "text": "From LG PR Dept.\n\nAchievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is a Grand Challenge, especially for businesses. The SDGs provide a powerful aspiration for improving our world \u2013 laying out where we collectively need to go and how to get there.\n\nAs a global electronic giant, LG Electronics in its own little way has worked with the UN and other notable non-government organizations across the world to support the SDGs and reiterated its commitment to better the life for all through its products and services.\n\nIts commitment to the planet is evident in every one of its core technologies.\n\nAccording to Mr. IL Hwan Lee, President, LG Electronics, Middle East & Africa Region, LG is committed to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. \u201cAs a responsible global corporate citizen, LG Electronics is set to contributing to the achievement of the SDGs as the main goal of its social contribution activities. Our focus is on developing new innovations across Sustainability for the Community. We are committed to providing electronic products that help customers live better. To support this, we have developed a mid to long term plan themed: LGE & SDGs which we are working towards\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the last couple of years, LG has introduced a wide range of products across the areas of TVs & Home Entertainment, Kitchen, Laundry, Computers, Air Conditioning & Solar that fit into the technologies of the future with the SDGs at heart. Some of such that promote eco-friendly society include LG DUAL Inverter, LG NeON 2, LG WashTower and the CordZero M9 robot vacuum cleaner.\n\nThe revolutionary DUAL Inverter Compressor technology inside LG\u2019s air conditioners never stops adjusting speed for the perfect temperatures without wasting electricity thanks to its lower speed. The compressor reduces electricity usage by 70 percent despite cooling rooms 40 percent faster than conventional models.\n\nWhen it comes to TVs, LG\u2019s OLED self-lit technology ticks the most environmentally-friendly boxes. They have been recognized as Eco Products by SGS, especially its OLED models with no backlight meaning fewer plastic parts, less indoor air pollution and 50 percent less VOC emissions. OLED has a comparatively-high recycle rate and doesn\u2019t contain hazardous substances like cadmium and indium phosphide.\n\nLG OLED TVs are easy on the eyes and have been engineered to cause minimal eye strain via low blue light modes and zero flickering, with certification from T\u00dc V Rheinland of Germany and UL in the United States.\n\nThis year, LG Soundbars are the first of their kind to receive SGS Eco Product Certification. Many LG soundbars use polyester resin sourced from used plastic bottles or recycled plastics, one using jersey fabric sourced from recycled PET bottles \u2013 so for every unit produced, almost seven plastic battles are saved from the hazardous landfill. Even the packaging is greener! More recycled molded pulp and less EPS plastic and foam are used, and the new L-shaped packaging lets more units be transported at once for fewer trucks on the road.\n\nRecently, LG unveiled Net Zero homes to demonstrate innovations that reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency and enhance daily life. The New American Home and The New American Remodel showcased the wonders of an LG-solar-powered house filled with energy-efficient consumer electronics, appliances and air solutions.\n\nKey to the homes\u2019 environmental sustainability and appealing designs are rooftop installations of high-efficiency solar modules from residential renewable energy leader LG Business Solutions. Forty LG NeON 2 60-cell modules help power each home to support their Net Zero designs. These popular high-efficiency modules generate more power from the same amount of sunlight than lower-efficiency modules of the same size while blending in unobtrusively to the look and feel of the home\u2019s design.\n\nLG Electronics few years ago set a new direction for its social contribution efforts by reflecting the opinions of the management and key stakeholders, and identified five of the 17 SDGs as its priority. LG Electronics continuously develops and implements initiatives that contribute to achieving these 5 SDGs, and monitors the progress. The company\u2019s SDGs plan were categories into three, which are promotion of intelligent lifestyle, creation of a better society and realization of Carbon and Circular Economy.\n\nPromote Intelligent Lifestyle\n\nLG has long been committed to projects that benefit the environment. LG Carbon Fund was established in 2017 to support the development of GHGreducing technologies and solutions through the virtual cycle concept wherein all profits from LG Carbon Fund investments are funneled back into the effort to reduce greenhouse gases. LG is also an active participant in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project, which seeks to curb harmful emissions through investing technology and capital in developing countries.\n\nThe company plans to contribute to sustainable growth by implementing three commitments and nine Goals on a mid- to long-term basis. Its commitment is to promote intelligent lifestyle, create a better society and realize zero carbon and circular economy. To fulfill this commitments, LG Electronics is improving the life of its customers by providing more easy-t-use products applied with AI and future technology. The company\u2019s focus here has been on establishing intelligent living environment, pursuing healthy life for its customers and expanding green business.\n\nRealization of Carbon and Circular Economy\n\nTowards the realization of zero carbon and circular economy, the electronic giant has reduced carbon emissions in its production level by 150,000 tons by 2020 compared to the base year 2008 (i.e 1 million tons in cumulative reductions). In its mid to long term plan, LG wants to achieve 80% Green 3 Star Products by self-assessment of environmentally friendly products and achieve 95% recycle rate of waste from production sites by 2030.\n\nCreating a Better Society\n\nTo establish a sustainable supply chain, the company plans to use 100% RMAP conformant smelters by the end of this year, assess the CSR risks of all its tier 1 suppliers and expand the scope to include its tier 2 and 3 this year as well. Its plan is to establish the highest level of safety culture in the manufacturing industry (independent stage) by 2030. Achieve 100% low risk for all the production sites in CSR self-assessment; improve work efficiency and the level of employee satisfaction by achieving work and life balance through fundamental changes in work style.\n\nLG\u2019s pledge is to support stakeholders\u2019 growth and independence through partnership. Establish volunteer program in all countries where we do business by 2030. And it has evidently demonstrated its commitment to achieve these set goals with its recent products, partnerships with other organization with shared goals and advocacy across the world.",

The association arrived at the decision after its emergency meeting held in Benin.\n\nThe NEC in a communique signed by the president, Chief Dave Emakunu and secretary, Hon Johnson Idolor Akpolome, said the association frowned at the amendment of the university law which empowers the Edo State government to appoint an acting vice chancellor for the university and the dissolution of the governing council.\n\nIt also condemned what it termed a deliberate attempt to damage the cherished image of the university that has produced quality manpower who are excelling in their respective endeavours and the strike actions by all the unions in the university which has paralysed academic activities in the university.\n\nIt frowned at the role played by members of the State House of Assembly including the speaker who is a product of the university in the passage of the obnoxious law and the deliberate underfunding of the university by the Edo State government.\n\nThe statement reads in part:\n\n\u201cThe National Executive Council (NEC) of AAU, Ekpoma expresses displeasure at the Ambrose Alli University Special intervention Powers Provisions law, 2021 which was hurriedly passed by the Edo State House of Assembly without due process as there was no public hearing to seek the input of all the major stakeholders in the University and the general public.\n\n\u201cNEC condemned the new law in its entirety and sought that it be repealed without further delay, as the law is capable of causing anarchy in the University and creating a legacy reminiscent of military dictatorship. By that, the appointment of an acting Vice-Chancellor should follow due process and with a definite duration, after which the process of appointing a substantive Vice-Chancellor should commence by the 1999 University law as amended.\n\n\u201cThe dissolution of the Governing Council of the University was done in bad faith and should be rescinded as there are no indicting reports against the Council in the Public domain. NEC calls on the Government to immediately consider the Visitation Panel\u2019s report and issue a white paper that would guide future actions in the University and by best governance practices as was done in the case of the University of Lagos recently.\n\n\u201cNEC expressed displeasure over the repeated scandalous remarks made by the Edo State Government about the products of the University and viewed such remarks as an attempt to give a \u2018dog a bad name to kill it\u2019.

          "text": "Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has reiterated the readiness of the Federal Government to offer appropriate technical support to African countries for the development of their aviation sectors.\n\nHe disclosed this in a keynote address at the inaugural graduation ceremony of the Gambian Middle level Meteorological Technicians trained through a partnership between the Government of The Gambia and the Federal Government of Nigeria, held at the Department of Water Resources Training School, Banjul International Airport, Yundum, The Gambia, at the weekend.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has over the years developed huge capacities in several areas of the Aviation sector, including Meteorological and Hydrological Services and is ready to deploy such for the development of the Aviation sectors of African countries.\n\nWhile noting that the entire global workforce in the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of the 193 World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) members including The Gambia and Nigeria is estimated to be more than 300,000, Sirika revealed that only about half of the 193 members have educational infrastructure that can address some of the specific/tailored training needs of Meteorological and Hydrological Services.\n\nSirika disclosed that the WMO encourages members to close this gap through increased cooperation and collaborative partnership such as the one between Nigeria and The Gambia, adding that one of the instruments of the partnership is through the WMO Regional Training Centres (RTCs) and affiliated training institutes.\n\n\u201cRTC Nigeria has evolved over the years. It began in 1957 as a National Meteorological Training School in Lagos, Nigeria, to train Class IV Meteorological Technicians while in 1964, a Regional Meteorological Training Centre (RMTC) was established, also in Lagos, Nigeria, to train Class III and Class II Meteorological Technicians.\n\nBy 1975, both training Centres were merged and designated as Meteorological Research and Training Institute (MRTI) to train Classes IV, III and II which is now referred to as the Basic Instructional Package for Meteorological Technicians (BIP-MT).\n\nIn 1994, the Department of Meteorology (now Department of Meteorology and Climate Science) at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria was also designated as the University component of the RMTC in Nigeria and recognized as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Regional Training Centre for the West African Countries\u2019 sub-region.\n\nThis RTC is under the auspices of Nigerian Meteorological Agency and statutorily funded by it and is responsible for the training of Meteorological Personnel from Nigeria, English speaking West African countries, and other African countries.\n\nTo cater for the increasing training needs and space for physical expansion, under my administration as the Minister Responsible for Meteorology in Nigeria, a new training school was officially commissioned in Katsina, Nigeria in May 2019 by me.\n\nCurrently, the process is ongoing for the designation of the National Water Resources Institute, Kaduna, Nigeria as a WMO RTC for operational Hydrology.\n\nThis is to emphasise the presence of capacities in Nigeria to meet the training demands of the continent,\u201d the Aviation minister stated.\n\nHe further disclosed that to ensure quality of training content and service delivery by the WMO RTC in Nigeria, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency under his supervision, subjected the centre to the WMO review between 2016 and 2018, adding that the result is a re-confirmation of the RTC by WMO in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe RTC already acquired Quality Management System (QMS) International Standard Organisation (ISO) 29990:2010 certification for training services in August 2019, making Nigeria the first and only country in Africa so far with the certification.\n\nThe RTC Quality Policy is committed to training well qualified and efficient manpower for National Meteorological Services and Allied Services for West African Sub-region and Africa in general\u201d.\n\nHe assured the people of The Gambia that the quality of training the Middle level Meteorological Technicians received through this partnership is never in doubt.\n\nSirika urged the graduates of the Middle Level Meteorological Technicians course to \u201cbring their newly acquired skills to bear in the discharge of their duties, and ensure knowledge is transferred to other colleagues in your various work places\u201d.\n\nSpeaking also at the ceremony, Hon. James Furmus Peter Gomez, Minister, Ministry of Fisheries and Water Resources, The Gambia, commended Senator Sirika for gracing the occasion, adding that his presence at the graduation ceremony has further strengthened the cordial and fruitful bilateral ties that exist between the Department of Water Resources and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) and by extension between our two countries.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Government and People of the Republic of The Gambia, I once again extend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Government of Federal Republic of Nigeria for the bi-lateral assistance it has been rendering in many ways to help improve the standard of the Meteorological services in The Gambia.\n\nWe particularly note the efforts you have been making towards the capacity development of our personnel in fundamental aspects of meteorological observations and forecasting, as well as quality management system, all geared towards meeting the standard set by World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),\u201d Gomez said.",

          "text": "*Family demands compensation, unbiased investigation\n\n*Lawyer, friend alleges plot to attribute Covid-19 as cause of death\n\nJoy Joseph, Lagos\n\nThe family of late David Akpan a laundry man who was unlawfully arrested, kept in a congested detention facility at the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force), Oshodi, are demanding for compensation and an unbiased investigation into the circumstances that led to his death while in detention.\n\nDavid, a father of three, was arrested alongside his wife, Blessing Akpan, at Census Close Estate gate, Babs Animashaun Street in Surulere, by Taskforce operatives, who were allegedly out to enforce Covid-19 curfew, around 11p.m. on Sunday, March 14.\n\nThe couple, it was learnt, were heading home after the days business, when the operatives embarked on a raid in the area, arresting them and several others.\n\nDaily Times reports that the suspects numbering over 70, were arrested, squeezed into a waiting black maria, and whisked away to the Task Force office in Oshodi, around 3a.m. the next day.\n\nDavid, who hails from Akwa-Ibom state had after his arrest, notified his friend, Mr. Akwenuke John, to come secure his bail and that of his wife, this is as he complained that he was detained in a black maria truck that had little or no air due to congestion.\n\nPreliminary investigations by our correspondent revealed that attempts by John to secure the release of the duo, over 24hours after their arrest, proved abortive, as one Damisu Okhakwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) who heads the Liaison Unit at the Task-Force Office, insisted she had other suspects to attend to.\n\nAccording to John, who spoke to Daily Times via a Telephone conversation, Okhakwu was begged to at least bring David out of the stuffy holding cell, following his complain of inability to breathe well, but the officer allegedly refused, asking John to come the next day. It was however too late as David died before help could come his way.\n\nThe distraught John, said: \u201cDavid and his wife were locked up in one of the Task Force trucks popularly known as, \u2018black Maria\u2019, he managed to call me to notify me of their arrest and seek my assistance to secure their bail the following day. He bitterly complained about how the truck was overcrowded, stuffy, short of air, and how he was finding it very difficult to breath.\n\n\u201cOn arrival at the Lagos State Task Force around 10.a.m on Monday March 15, with the help of a mutual friend, i approached the Head of Liaison Unit at the Task-Force Office, DSP Damisu Barbara Okhakwu, for the bail of David and his wife but the unit head who was busy profiling scores of people that had been arrested a couple of days before David, his wife and several others from the Surulere axis, instructed to come back on Tuesday, March, on the grounds that she and her team needed time to conclude the job at hand before commencing that of the people arrested the previous night.\n\n\u201cBased on David\u2019s earlier complaint about the over congested Task Force Black Maria truck and the sight of conspicuously overcrowded detention cells, 1 pleaded with the police officers to bring David out for a brief chat especially because David had complained about breathing challenges while in the truck but the Inspector addressed as the CRO on duty categorically refused, saying that it would be a herculean task to reach the part of the cell where David was talk less of getting David to come out, thereby confirming the cell was overcrowded.\n\n\u201cAll efforts and pleas to get David to the better ventilated counter area of the detention facility fell on deaf ears. By the time I retuned at about 10.a.m on Tuesday, March 16, as instructed by the Liaison Unit Head, I saw scores of people including David\u2019s wife and a few familiar faces including his neighbor that had been arrested on Sunday night from the Surulere axis.\n\n\u201cAfter exchanging pleasantries with a couple of familiar faces, I was still trying to explain my purpose of visit to a neighbor when David\u2019s wife rushed to tell me he had been reportedly rushed to the hospital as claimed by the police that had suddenly become very friendly and caring to her. As soon as she turned around to respond to a call from one of the female police officers, the few familiar faces told me that the person that Lady was referring to had died.\n\n\u201cThey said that before the police responded to their calls that someone had fainted, it took over one and a half hours and that at the time he was being carried out of the cell, his body was already very stiff and that some police officers when started hitting him with hard objects with the hope of reviving him to no avail.\u201d\n\nJohn said the taskforce operatives did not show remorse for the negligence which resulted in the loss of a life, but instead, tried to hide the truth from the family, and mad it almost impossible to locate the remains of the deceased that was deposited at a morgue.\n\nHe claimed it took a the intervention of the family\u2019s lawyer, Barrister Oladimeji Olaleye, who petitioned the Lagos State Government, the Attorney General of Lagos State, and the Lagos State Taskforce, to get operatives of the agency to lead the family to where the remains of deceased was deposited at Mainland Hospital Morgue.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey were so sure that one of them told me that, if David wasn\u2019t dead, he will never die again. They also mentioned that two other people fainted within the cell as a result of the congestion and negligence of the police even though suspects were calling for help.\n\nWhen I asked the police about the where about of the deceased (David), they told me, he fainted and was rushed to the General Hospital Yaba and not Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) at Ikeja which was obviously nearer.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the incident that had occurred, the deceased\u2019s wife and practically all the people arrested from the Surulere axis were unconditionally released, a process supervised by the Task-Force chairman that had TANGO 1 inscribed on the back of his police uniform.\n\nAfter their release, I took the deceased\u2019s wife and two others in search of David at General Hospital Harvey Yaba but the hospital attendants said, they had no record of any such person and that no one was brought there by the Task Force on that day nor the recent past.\n\n\u201cI quickly called a mutual friend and asked for a few minutes to confirm David\u2019s whereabouts from the Head of Liaison Unit, only for the mutual friend to call back shortly after, to break the unfortunate news of David\u2019s death and that his body had been deposited at the Military hospital Yaba.\n\nConsidering the latest development, I deceived David\u2019s wife that David was in the Military Hospital\u2019s ICU and that Soldiers, wouldn\u2019t allow us see David and that we were advised to check on him the next day at 10.a.m.\n\n\u201cThe next morning, she called to notify me of her intention to set out which I systematically stalled till I succeeded in getting to speak with one of her relatives to whom I finally broke the sad news for the ease of consoling her.\n\nMeanwhile, for the benefit of clearing all doubts and eliminating the fears that the Police took the deceased to the Military hospital morgue with the intention of denying the family access to the corpse and thereafter sweep the case under the carpet, I called a few highly placed military officials to help confirm if truly the corpse had been deposited at the Military Hospital morgue which the Military refuted.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the family was alarmed and suspected foul play so they decided to engage the services of a legal practitioner who submitted a petition to the Lagos State Government (LASG), Attorney General of Lagos State and the LASG Task Force office, before visiting the Head of Liaison Unit at the Task Force office who reluctantly agreed to see the family of the deceased and insensitively said, \u2018she doesn\u2019t like seeing people when she\u2019s about to eat because she\u2019s very likely to lose her appetite\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe told her we discovered David\u2019s remains was not at the Military Hospital Morgue contrary to the information emanating from her office, we wanted her to take us to wherever the remains of the deceased had been deposited by her subordinates whom we couldn\u2019t identify.\n\nAt this point, she was left with no other choice than to arrange a team of her subordinates to take us to the Mainland Hospital morgue where we were made to part with N3, 000 and produce an affidavit of our relationship to the deceased before we were given an opportunity to identify the corpse.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, the police team that took us to the morgue disappeared before our very eyes shortly after they spoke with the Unit head that also scolded the family friend for suggesting the police should pay the N3, 000 identification fee requested by the morgue attendant as a show of concern to the family.\u201d\n\nJohn further lamented that since the death of David, who was the breadwinner of his immediate and extended family, neither DSP Okhakwu, nor the Task Force management, has made effort to condole with the family of the deceased.\n\nRather, he alleged that Okhakwu has repeatedly tried to threaten and intimidate him because her name reflected on the petition addressed to the state government as the Head of the Liaison unit under whose watch and negligence David died.\n\n\u201cThis sort of negligence basically sums up to lack of emotions and respect for human life which further reemphasizes why the public generally have issues trusting officers of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nWhile waiting for the Task Force to officially convey a heartfelt condolence with a clear intention to adequately compensate the family of the deceased,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlthough our correspondent gathered that the Lagos State Government has ordered that the matter be investigated by the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), John said he feared their is an attempt to bury the matter as operatives investigating the matter are insisting on a Covid-19 test, saying if the result comes out positive, the mater will be closed.\n\n\u201d The matter is now being investigated at SCID, and they said an autopsy and a Covid-19 test will be done. The Covid-19 test has been done and one of the officer told me that if the result comes out positive, that will be the end of the matter.\n\n\u201cI fear their is a plot to cover up the matter with the Covid-19 test. If his covid-19 result comes out positive, then they should do contact tracing and if nobody else who was in the cell with him has rested positive or has died of Covid-19 in the last two months, then it cannot be Covid-19.\n\n\u201c It also doesn\u2019t make sense that they are enforcing a law and also contravening same law,\u201d he maintained.\n\nLawyer to the family, Oladimeji Olaleye, also spoke on the development. He corroborated the fears of John, saying the police may be attempting to cover up the matter with the Covid-19 test.\n\nHe however made the demands of the family as follows: \u201cThe family should be reasonably compensated. The office of the Attorney General called to say I write to the Coroner requesting an inquiry into the cause of death. The Lagos State government also referred our petition to SCID.\n\n\u201cWe were called and the family went there to writer their statement. What I see is that they are trying to push our case to Covid-19. He was hail and hearty, we even had witnesses that confirmed the detention facility was stuffy and lacked air.\n\n\u201cThe family needs explanation as to what happened and why in their pursuit of enforcing Covid-19 protocol, they themselves are breaking the protocol. Secondly, a formal apology, saying what happened ought not to have happened.\n\nThirdly, compensation for the family. He left a wife, three children and a large family. All of them are devastated and they would lobe to see an end to this.\u201d\n\nReacting to the allegations, spokesperson for the Task Force, Femi Moliki, debunked claims that Daivd died in detention, he however said the matter is being investigated under the supervision of the Lagos State Government.\n\nMoliki said: \u201c Thee is a petition to the Lagos State Government and they are already working on it. Until when the findings of their investigation is out, I can\u2019t say anything.\n\nThe fact is that it wasn\u2019t a normal raid, it was the enforcement of curfew and they were close to a hotel where people were staying beyond the curfew.\n\n\u201cIt was in that process that they were raided. The wife sells close to the hotel. It is also not true that the black maria was congested.\n\nThe wife was not their, it was his brother that was there and his brother confirmed the man was I\u2019ll. He didn\u2019t die in our custody.\n\n\u201c I leanrt he slumped and he was moved to Ikeja General Hospital where he died.

          "title": "'N2 trillion stolen yearly in Nigeria by officials' \u2014 Daily Times Nigeria",
          "text": "Success Nwogu\n\nExperts have said that about N2 trillion is allegedly stolen every year in Nigeria by public and private officials, usually with the technical assistance of professionals.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Chairman, Human and Environmental Development Centre (HEDA) Resource Centre, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, said that this was the view of experts and participants during a summit in Abuja at the 24th Anti-Corruption Situation Room (ACSR) with the theme: Role of professional associations, ethics, codes of conduct and sanctions in the fight against corruption, organised by HEDA with the support of MacArthur Foundation.\n\nHe added that the participants at the summit said Nigeria has 107 registered professional groups and that some of the members allegedly are enablers of corruption.\n\nHe identified participants and experts at the event to include representatives the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC), United Nations Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC), Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), National Orientation Agency (NOA), Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs).\n\nHe added that representatives of professional bodies at the event were Mohammed Abba, Nigeria Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS), Sir Emmanuel Wike, Nigeria Institute of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, Nigerian Union of Journalists, (NUJ), Soji Akpampa of Integrity, Dr. Akubuiro of Chartered Institute of Loan and Risk Management (CILRM), Olatunde Amolegbe, Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers, Prof. Ejiofor Chinedum, Institute of Chartered Economics of Nigeria, (ICEN) among many others.\n\nAccording to Suraju, for the first time in recent memory, Nigerian professionals, civil society organisations, media and anti-corruption agencies during the summit forged a new historic partnership aimed at stemming over N2 trillion allegedly stolen every year in Nigeria\u2019s public and private sectors.\n\nHe stated that the country\u2019s main professional groups at the conference committed themselves to collaborating with anti-corruption institutions and civil society working on anti-corruption.\n\nHe noted that with the new partnership, it will no longer be business as usual for professionals who aid crooks in public and private sectors.\n\nAccording to him, the participants urged the Federal Government (FG) to inaugurate the National Procurement Council (NPC), expected to have 11 members, five from the government and six from the public, established to strengthen the Public Procurement Act and ensure transparency in the award of contracts by MDAs.\n\nHe further said they also urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission, (ICPC) to make examples from a few professionals as a deterrent and to ensure compliance with professional accountability in all spheres of public and private administration.\n\nHe added that they also called on FG to ensure that repatriation of illicit funds through Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) should include sanctions on professionals at home and abroad who aid corruption.\n\nSuraju, in his opening address, said corruption continues to be of major concern in Nigeria as the country searches for growth, development and stability.\n\nHe said in the past few years, various anti-corruption groups have recorded significant milestones but that in spite of the noticeable efforts of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agencies, corruption remains a recurrent decimal spurring a string of socio-political ills threatening democracy.\n\nHe stated that while professional groups continue to run the country in many spheres, with momentous contributions to the advancement of the country, it is noteworthy that one of the major enablers of corruption in Nigeria allegedly are members of professional associations that provide technical skills which aid corrupt private and public officials.\n\nHe quoted a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Femi Falana, as having said at the summit that every stolen wealth allegedly has the connivance of Nigerian professionals, either as accountants, lawyers, engineers and quantity surveyors who procure inferior building materials, medical doctors that procure health certificates to aid corrupt officials who feign collapse in courts, bankers, auditors and even journalists who give frivolous awards to stupendously corrupt political figures.\n\nAccording to Suraji, a former Director General of the Inter-Governmental Agency Against Money Launder and terrorist Financing in West Africa (GIABA), Prof. Shehu Abdullahi, spoke on Interventions from key state actors, development partners and non state actors.\n\nHe stated that Abdullahi, who doubles as the Nigerian Ambassador to Russia said the future of transparency and accountability hinges on high moral standards of Nigerian professional bodies.\n\nHe added that government\u2019s efforts will not fully succeed if professionals continue to offer professional services to dubious officials.\n\nDr. Gbenga Oduntan of Kent University, United Kingdom, who according to him, addressed the participants, spoke on \u2018Enablers of illicit asset and corruption: Role of professional bodies in preventing, tracing and recovering illicit wealth.\u2019\n\nSuraji stated that in the communique issued at the end of the summit, participants said it was high time the anti-graft agencies took the anti-corruption battle to the field of professionals in various sectors of the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cProfessionals should join the anti-corruption crusade in line with the relevant sections of the constitution in Section 15 (5) and section 24 which mandates the state, professional groups and the public to fight corruption as a legal obligation, they should self regulate to ensure the conduct of their members does not lubricate the corruption mill while at the same time reviewing their internal code of conduct mechanism, while training their members to meet the changing pattern of local and global corruption practices that affect Nigeria, participants stated in the communique.\n\nIt urge that younger members in professional bodies and s(he) would-be professionals should be engaged in the accountability-driven renaissance in their relevant institutions and associations.\n\n\u201cThe groups urged professional and civil society groups to collaborate with the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation to strengthen and promote a public accountability regime, adding that efficiency of professional institutions can be negatively affected by weak legal framework.\n\n\u201cThey called on the Ministry of Justice to have a department that focuses on banks and financial institutions to deal with professional misconducts.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe National Assembly, the State Houses of Assembly and the Judiciary should enjoy financial autonomy to strengthen professional conducts of judges as contained in Section 121 of the Nigerian Constitution while State Governors should comply with the relevant provision of the law.\n\nEthics and moral philosophy should be ingrained in educational curriculum in primary and tertiary institutions to nurse a sustained culture of transparency and truth in generations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cParticipants expressed profound appreciation to HEDA Resource Centre and its partners for their consistent campaign against corruption, especially for this historic focus on professionals, opening a new and unique frontier in the collective drive to free Nigeria from the stifling grip of corruption and all its associated vices.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, on Friday disclosed that 52 Nigerians have experienced moderate to severe reactions after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nExecutive Director and Chief Executive Officer, NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib disclosed this at a news conference in Abuja.\n\nHe also said 8,439 Nigerians experienced mild Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after taking the vaccine.\n\nShuaib stated that the 52 Nigerians that experienced moderate to severe reactions to the vaccine were brought down with fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, since the vaccination program was officially rolled out on 15th of April 2021, a total of 8,439 mild Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) have been reported. These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

Evidence of placement of advertisement was not attached to either payment vouchers or contract files. The amount expended was above the threshold of the Council and the contracts were split as some contracts were awarded to same contractor with LPO and work order issued on the same date.\u201d\n\nThe committee said: \u201cExamination of records and documents revealed that the Commission\u2019s Tenders Board approved the award of contract for printing of security materials in the sum of N451 million to a company in March 2017 in contravention of provisions of Federal Government Circular No.SGF/OP/I/S.3/XI/849 of 16th January, 2016 which reiterated the approved revised thresholds for service wide application, for which the Parastatal Tender Board can only exercise authority on works whose value is less than N250 million while any sum above this, is to be referred to the Ministerial Tenders Board for approval.\n\n\u201cWe sought for the authority for the above approval including the Ministerial approval but none was provided.\n\n\u201cThe above unilateral award of contracts without following due process may lead to awarding contracts to unqualified contractors. Recommendation The Registrar/CEO should be sanctioned in line with provisions of Financial Regulation 3117.\u201d\n\nIn the second query, it was observed that the \u201cexamination of contracts awarded for the printing of Security and Non- Security Documents valued at \u20a66,166,405,407.42 revealed that the contracts were awarded without compliance with the provisions of PART VI, Section 24 (I) of the Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2017 as amended, which states that except as provided by this Act, all procurements of goods and works by all procuring entities shall be conducted by open competitive bidding.\n\n\u201cThe following irregularities were also noted, Quotations were not collected from three bidders as required by PPA 2007, Taxes were not deducted from some of the contract payments. iii. There was no Technical and Financial evaluation, Evidence of placement of advertisement was not attached to either payment vouchers or contract files.\n\n\u201cThe amount expended was above the threshold of the Council, The contracts were split as some contracts were awarded to same contractor with LPO and work order issued on the same date.\u201d\n\nResponse\n\nBut in his response, the NECO Registrar said the N461 million component of the contract \u201cwere payments to Data Science Nigeria Limited for the supply of Optical Mark Readers for objectives questions paper for various examinations conducted by the Council but failed to justify payment for it , making the Committee to sustain the query against the Examination body and asked for the refund.\u201d\n\nOn the N6.1 billion query, Professor Obioma said: \u201cThe contracts for the printing for our questions are awarded through selective tendering. This is the case to avoid leakages of our examinations and award of contract to printers of doubted integrity.\u201d\n\nAlso not satisfied with his explanations, the committee as declared by its chairman, sustained the query for lack of convincing defence.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Armed bandits Sunday attacked Unguwan Kabulo community in Chikun local government area of Kaduna state and abducted 14 people, Blueprint has gathered.\n\nResidents told our correspondents that 17 people, including women and children, were earlier abducted but three escaped and returned to the community.\n\nA resident of a nearby community who identified himself as Mohammadu said the incident occurred around 1:30 am Sunday when residents woke to the sound of gunshots in the community which he said, was just a kilometre away from Udawa town.\n\n\u201cThey went away with 14 adults, women, and children from the house of a man called Shehu and his neighbour,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammadu however said a security helicopter on surveillance was sighted in the area.\n\nWhen contacted, Public Relations Officer of the state Police command, ASP Mohammed Jalige asked for time to verify the attack but did not at the time of filing this report.\n\nHostages rescued\n\nHowever, the state commissioner of internal security and home affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, later issued a statement of the rescue of kidnapped hostages around Ungwan Najaja, Kerawa, Igabi local government area of the state.\n\nHe said bandits had invaded the village and kidnapped scores of women but security agencies were notified and a fighter jet was swiftly mobilised to the location.\n\nThe commissioner said when the air platforms traced them to the outskirts of the village, the bandits had scampered into the forest and abandoned the women.\n\nThe bandits had earlier injured one Hamza Ibrahim while moving out of the village with the kidnapped women, many of whom were housewives.\n\nSimilarly, bandits have killed the personal driver of the Emir of Birnin Gwari identified as Nasiru Muhammad.\n\nSecurity agencies reported that the armed bandits attacked the Buruku-Birnin Gwari road and Nasiru Muhammad was shot dead around Ungwan Yako forest along the route.\n\nReacting to the incident, Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed sadness at the killing of the Emir\u2019s driver and sent condolences to the royal father and the family of the deceased, while praying for the repose of his soul.\n\nHe quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai as commending the fighter jet crew and thanked them for their swift response in rescuing the hostages from the mass kidnap attempt in Igabi local government area.\n\nFCTA\n\nIn a related development, a father and his son were abducted by some yet-to-be identified gunmen who swooped on Kuchiko Relocation Development Area in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe abduction occurred when the hoodlums subdued the security guards who were armed with knives and related weapons.\n\nThe gunmen, Blueprint gathered, arrived the area in the early hours of Sunday and shot without caution to scare residents, most of whom were woken up by the seemingly endless shooting .\n\nBlueprint further gathered that the timely intervention of soldiers from Defence College Bwari, brought the situation under control after a tough duel between the soldiers and the gunmen.\n\nMonarch urges on insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the Ona of Abaji and Chairman Council of Traditional Rulers in the FCT, HRH Dr. Adamu Baba Yunusa, has called for more coordinated and concerted efforts on the part of security agencies and the various tiers of government to reduce insecurity, especially kidnapping and armed robbery in the territory.\n\nDr. Yunusa stated this Sunday in an interview with Blueprint at his palace, Abaji.\n\nHe observed that residents of Abuja cannot sleep again with two eyes closed due to increasing harassment by armed gangs.\n\nYunusa said the rate of kidnapping and armed robbery had doubled in the rural areas, especially in Abaji, Kwali, Gwagwalada Kuje and Bwari area councils even with the presence of local vigilante not properly equipped to engage the criminals.\n\n\u201cKidnapping has become a very worrisome issue for us now in Abaji and other area councils. The boys will just pick anybody they like and start demanding N5 million or N10million without asking where the relatives of the victims will get that type of money.\n\n\u201cWe want government to do whatever is necessary to solve this problem which has become a national malady. The federal and state government including FCT administrations are trying but we urge them to do more by providing better equipment and training for security personnel.\n\n\u201cWe have vigilante who work with the police but they are not enough. We want more and they do not have the type of equipment to face the criminals. The federal government should allow the vigilante groups to carry the necessary equipment to face the bandits without fearing for their safety, \u201cthe first class monarch said.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to youths and political leaders in the territory to embrace peace and learn to accommodate each other and also engage in useful activities such as farming to ensure gainful employment that will eventually reduce idleness and crime rate in the communities.\n\nSokoto\n\nAlso, some suspected bandits Friday night killed three persons at Garin Zogo village in Sabon Birni local government of Sokoto state.\n\nThey also invaded eight villages in the local government area.\n\nConfirming the development, the councillor representing the areas, Ibrahim Muhammad Saraki, said Garin Zogo was attacked Friday around 10:30pm.\n\n\u201cThey killed three persons and injured one. They also rustled animals, broke into many shops and carted away unascertained number of goods,\u201d the councillor said.\n\nHe said the hoodlums similarly attacked Nasarawa, Gidan Idi and Rambadawa villages Saturday where they injured three person and rustled animals, and further stormed the homes of residents of the area and dispossessed them of their belongings.\n\nThe councillor said: \u201cWe are not living in peace in our communities any longer because the killing is taking place every day. As I am talking to you now our people don\u2019t longer sleep in their homes. They spend their night in Sabon Birni town and return in the morning, including me.\n\n\u201cAnd there are some villages that are completely deserted like Rambadawa, Garin Idi, Tudun Wada, Nasarawa, Tamindawa, Garin Ango, Tsaunar Dogo and Tashalawa.\u201d\n\nThe special adviser to the council chairman on security, Lamiru Umar while corroborating this said, some of their people were currently taking refuge at Tsululu village in Niger Republic.\n\nThe spokesman of the Sokoto Police Command, ASP Sunusi Abubakar could not be reached for comment.\n\nOsun\n\nBut the Osun State Police Command Sunday said it foiled an attempted robbery and kidnapping of motorists along Akure/Ilesa road, Iwarajta by some unknown gunmen.\n\nThis was disclosed Sunday by the command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Yemisi Opalola in Osogbo.\n\nAccording to Opalola, the suspected gunmen, at about 6 pm Saturday, came out of the bushes along Akure/Ilesha Road, stopping vehicles in an attempt to rob and kidnap their occupants.\n\n\u201cBut the quick intervention of the Police, JTF, and other local security outfits prevented the gunmen from carrying out their nefarious activities,\u201d she said.\n\nCustoms kill 2\n\nIn a related development, two persons, a male and female were feared killed in Eruwa town, Ibarapa East local government area of Oyo state allegedly by men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS).\n\nThe incident occurred few minutes after the conduct of the state\u2019s local government elections.\n\nIt was learnt that the Customs men were said to be passing through the Eruwa road and met barricade mounted on the road by youth to prevent unusual movement of vehicles during the election at New Eruwa area of the town.\n\nThe barricade, it was gathered, followed tension in the town during the election over an alleged plans by some politicians in the area to perfect rigging in some wards in the town towards the end of the election.\n\nAccording to eye witness account, the youth were bent on searching the Customs vehicle to ascertain allegations that election materials were reportedly smuggled into the said vehicle by some politicians before allowing them passage\n\nOur source stressed that the situation later degenerated into hot argument with youth in the area threatening to attack the Customs men if they want to force their way out of the barricade as some of the Customs men were said to be parking the barricade out of the road.\n\nIt was at this juncture that some of youths resolved into stoning the Customs men with the NCS men on their part shooting into the air to scare the youths and others at the barricade during which the stray bullets from the sporadic shootings reportedly hit and killed two of the youths.\n\n\u201cIt later turned to a heated argument and all I could remember were gunshots in the air. Suddenly, two persons were down \u2013 a guy and a lady,\u201d the source said.\n\nAs at the time of sending this report, the Oyo/Osun NCS Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr Kayode Wey was yet to respond to our call for his reaction on the incident.\n\n\u201d Please sir. Let me confirm. I have not been briefed of any matter like that sir. Please sir, I would get back to you as soon as i have any information.\u201d\n\nCleric warns\n\nMeanwhile, leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has warned that the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) will be deadlier than Boko Haram, adding that another group will come up after the latter.\n\nHe issued the prophecies while addressing members of his congregation, confirming that Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau is dead.\n\nIn a statement, a copy of which Blueprint got in Abuja said: \u201cAbubakar Shekau is dead and buried, anyone that claims to be Shekau is just a joker but ISWAP will become deadlier as they want to shoot down planes, another terrorist group will rise up through Boko Haram but will fade out soon.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also mentioned some states that should be on alert against deadly attacks and killings.\n\nThe cleric further said: \u201cThe following states must be very watchful of major attacks that will happen; Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna, Yobe, Bauchi, Plateau, Benue, Adamawa, Ekiti, Ondo, Oyo, Imo, Anambra, Ebonyi, Cross River. They must not joke with this message.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Buhari Media Organisation, BMO, on Sunday said the one week suspension of plenary by the Senate to enable its members to participate in the zonal public hearing for the constitution review across the country has shown that the legislative body is serious about constitutional amendment.\n\nAccording to the BMO, this development has also reinforced the assertion that power to amend the Constitution does not lie with President Muhammadu Buhari as proposed by some groups who deliberately push that narrative to cause confusion.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, BMO recalled what President Buhari had said in his October 1, 2017, speech commemorating Nigeria\u2019s 57th independence anniversary.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari said that calls for restructuring of the country were legitimate but warned that they had to be decent and must follow legal channels such as the parliament.\n\n\u201cAt all events, proper dialogue and any desired constitutional changes should take place in a rational manner at the National and State Assemblies. These are the proper and legal fora for national debate, not some lopsided, undemocratic body with a pre-determined set of objectives\u201d.\n\nBMO said the public hearing for amendment of constitution as facilitated by National Assembly committee on Constitution review is the only acknowledged constitutional platform recognized by law, as part of the process of amending the Constitution and should be acknowledged by everybody.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has been very much up to speed on national opinions around the amendment and updating of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe much-awaited zonal public hearings on the review of the 1999 Constitution would hold from May 26 to 27 and the event would hold simultaneously across 12 state capitals in Nigeria. It would witness two public hearings per geopolitical zone and a national public hearing is expected to hold in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cWhile Jos and Minna would host the public hearings in the North Central geopolitical zone, North East and North West would hold in Bauchi and Gombe, as well as Kaduna and Sokoto respectively. Similarly, South-East would hold in Owerri and Enugu, South-South and South-West would be hosted in Port Harcourt and Asaba, as well as Akure and Lagos respectively.\n\n\u201cChairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege called on those who have already submitted memoranda to speak to the documents at the events\u201d.\n\nAccording to the group, this is a huge opportunity for all \u2018marginalised\u2019 groups, canvassers of a new Constitution, canvassers of new input into the Constitution and champions of redemption of errors in the Constitution to present their arguments for amendment of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cEthic irredentists that have made restructuring a symposium should also exploit this opportunity. This is the right and true process to amend the Nigerian Constitution with intent at restructuring as highlighted by the committee and anyone who has an interest in any aspect of the Constitution that needs to be amended can forward to the Constitution review committee,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "A Brazil based drug kingpin has been nabbed with 36 blocks of cocaine, weighing about 30 kilogrammes with a street value of over N8 billion (about $20m) at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA, Lagos by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nA statement on Sunday by NDLEA\u2019s spokesman, Femi Babafemi said the drug lord, Ejiofor Enwereaku, who leads a syndicate was arrested at the airport on Friday May 14, 2021 for importing 27.95 kilogrammes of cocaine using their organised criminal gang, which specialises in tagging/planting drugs in innocent travellers\u2019 luggage.\n\nBabafemi said based on intelligence, narcotic agents at the MMIA had on Saturday 8th May, 2021 intercepted a bag that arrived the Lagos airport from GRU, Brazil via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on the Ethiopian airline with baggage tag No- ET331199 but was disclaimed by an arriving passenger on the flight.\n\nHe said that the disclaimed bag was promptly secured by NDLEA operatives for investigation, adding that on Sunday, 9th May, 2021, a man came to the airport to make inquiry on how to get the disclaimed bag released, which prompted his immediate arrest and investigation.\n\nBabafemi disclosed that the disclaimed bag was opened in the presence of the arriving passenger and the man who had come to negotiate it\u2019s release.\n\nHe said when it was opened, the bag was found to contain 36 blocks of cocaine, weighing 27.95 kilogrammes.\n\nHe said a follow up sting operation was initiated, which led to the arrest on Friday 14th May of Ejiofor Enwereaku, the prime suspect, upon his arrival from Addis Ababa onboard Ethiopian airline.\n\nThe spokesman said during preliminary interrogation after his arrest, Enwereaku\n\nconfessed to have been contracted by his Ethiopian associate who is a notorious drug baron to claim and push out the consignment in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nBabafemi said the suspect also admitted to have paid the $24,500 bribe in three tranches to compromise NDLEA officers. The first was $10,000 delivered through his representative in Lagos and another $10, 000 via his First Bank account while the third tranche of $4,500 was paid at the point of his arrest.\n\nHe said Enwereaku\u2019s group is suspected to be responsible for recruiting traffickers to move illicit drugs to various destinations using Nigeria as their transit location and also planting drugs in the luggage of innocent travellers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd) apparently impressed by the outcome of the intelligence-led operational strategies that took weeks of painstaking efforts and closely monitored by him, commended the Commander, MMIA Command of the agency, Ahmadu Garba, his officers and men for their diligence and resilience in following up every lead in the case until the kingpin was successfully entrapped and arrested.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have warned that we\u2019ll henceforth not only go after the traffickers but with the same vigour target the cartels and the kingpins that operate them; the latest arrest is a clear confirmation that we\u2019ll match our words with action and that we\u2019ll come for those who will not back out of the criminal trade, wherever they are hiding pushing instruments of death through our borders to destroy the lives of our youths.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode",

          "text": "Hundreds of masked Hamas fighters brandishing assault rifles paraded in Gaza City and the group\u2019s top leader made his first public appearance on Saturday, in a defiant show of strength after the militants\u2019 11-day war with Israel.\n\nSaturday marked the first full day of a cease-fire, and Egyptian mediators held talks to firm up the truce which ended the fourth Israel-Hamas war in just over a decade.\n\nIn the fighting, Israel unleashed hundreds of airstrikes against militant targets in Gaza, while Hamas and other militants fired more than 4,000 rockets toward Israel. More than 250 people were killed, the vast majority of them Palestinians.\n\nIn Gaza City, residents began assessing damage.\n\nOne of Gaza City\u2019s busiest commercial areas, Omar al-Mukhtar Street, was covered in debris, smashed cars and twisted metal after a 13-floor building in its centre was flattened in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nMerchandise was covered in soot and strewn inside smashed stores and on the pavement. Municipal workers swept broken glass and twisted metal from streets and sidewalks.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t expect this amount of damage,\u201d said Ashour Subeih, who sells baby clothes. \u201cWe thought the strike was a bit further from us. But as you can see not an area of the shop is intact.\u201d\n\nHaving been in business for one year, Subeih estimated his losses were double what he has made so far.\n\nDrone video and photos showed some city blocks reduced to rubble, in between homes and businesses left standing.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have claimed victory.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of Hamas fighters wearing military camouflage paraded past the mourning tent for Bassem Issa, a senior commander killed in the fighting. The top Hamas leader in Gaza, Yehiyeh Sinwar, paid his respects in his first public appearance since the war began.\n\nIsrael bombed the house of Sinwar, along with that of other senior Hamas figures, as part of its attack on what it said was the group\u2019s military infrastructure. Israel\u2019s defense minister, Benny Gantz, has said Israel delivered a punishing blow to Hamas, and that top Hamas figures remained targets.\n\nStill, there was a widespread expectation that the cease-fire would stick for now, even if another round of fighting at some point seems inevitable.\n\nUnderlying issues remain unresolved, including an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade, now in its 14th year, that is choking Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million residents and a refusal by the Islamic militant Hamas to disarm.\n\nThe UN Security Council released a statement Saturday, welcoming the cease-fire and stressing \u201cthe immediate need for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThousands rallied in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, calling for coexistence between Jews and Arabs.\n\nThe fighting began on May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem. The barrage came after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\n\nHeavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.\n\nThe war has further sidelined Hamas\u2019 main political rival, the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, which oversees autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West\n\nBank. Hamas\u2019 popularity seemed to be growing as it positioned itself as a defender of Palestinian claims to Jerusalem.\n\nOn Friday, hours after the cease-fire took effect, thousands of Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa compound chanted against Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his self-rule government. \u201cDogs of the Palestinian Authority, out, out,\u201d they shouted, and \u201cThe people want the president to leave.\u201d\n\nIt was an unprecedented display of anger against Abbas. The conflict also brought to the surface deep frustration among Palestinians, whether in the occupied West Bank, Gaza or within Israel, over the status quo, with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process all but abandoned for years.\n\nDespite his weakened status, Abbas will be the point of contact for any renewed U.S. diplomacy, since Israel and the West, including the United States, consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is to meet with Abbas and Israeli leaders when he visits in the coming week. Abbas is expected to raise demands that any Gaza reconstruction plans go through the Palestinian Authority to avoid strengthening Hamas.\n\nAbbas met Saturday with Egyptian mediators, discussing the rebuilding of Gaza and internal Palestinian relations, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.\n\nAn Egyptian diplomat said that two teams of mediators were in Israel and the Palestinian territories to continue talks on firming up a cease-fire deal and securing long-term calm.\n\nThe diplomat said discussions include implementing agreed-on measures in Gaza and Jerusalem, including ways to prevent practices that led to the latest fighting. He did not elaborate. He was apparently referring to violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the planned eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east Jerusalem.\n\nThe diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes deliberations.\n\nSeparately, a 130-truck convoy with humanitarian aid and medical supplies reached the Gaza border from Egypt on Saturday, according to a senior Egyptian official at the border crossing. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nAcross Gaza, an assessment of the damage to the territory\u2019s already decrepit infrastructure began.\n\nThe ministry of public works and housing said that 769 housing and commercial units were rendered uninhabitable, at least 1,042 units in 258 buildings were destroyed and just over 14,500 units suffered minor damage.\n\nThe United Nations said about 800,000 people in Gaza do not have regular access to clean piped water, as nearly 50% of the water network was damaged in the fighting.\n\nIsrael has said it was targeting Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel system running under roads and homes, as well as command centers, rocket launchers and the homes of commanders. The Israeli military has said it was trying to minimize harm to civilians and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says at least 248 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children and 39 women, with 1,910 people wounded. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Twelve people were killed in Israel, all but one of them civilians, including a 5-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas and the smaller militant group of Islamic Jihad of hiding the actual number of fighters killed in the war. Prime Minister Netanyahu said Friday that more than 200 militants were killed, including 25 senior commanders.\n\nIslamic Jihad on Saturday gave a first account of deaths within its ranks, saying that 19 of its commanders and fighters were killed, including the head of the rocket unit in northern Gaza.",
