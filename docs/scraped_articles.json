          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nAs Nigeria marks its 61st independence, the ongoing strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors also enters its day 61 today (Friday).\n\nThis is even as the resident doctors insist that it will continue the total and indefinite strike action until its demands are met.\n\nRecall that the NARD had at the end of its National Executive Council meeting in Umuahia on July 31, announced a strike action that began on August 2, 2021.\n\nThe doctors said they unanimously resolved by vote to resume its strike after a critical appraisal of the performance of both Federal and State Governments on all the issues affecting their welfare and the insincerity of the government in implementing the Memorandum of Action after 113 days.\n\nSome of the demands include the migration of doctors from the Government Integrated Financial Management System platform to the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System platform, review of hazard allowance, inconsistency in payment of salaries, death allowances for members of the association who died during COVID-19.\n\nOther demands are the withdrawal of the case against them in court and the payment of their withheld August and September salaries.\n\nThe Federal government had through the Minister of Labour and Employment; Dr. Chris Ngige instituted a suit against the doctors over the abdication of its responsibilities.\n\nPart of the declaration as sought by the Federal Government was whether or not the \u201cno work, no pay\u201d rule should not be applied against the defendant.\n\nThe suit also contained a prayer seeking an order of the court to direct the striking doctors to return to work.\n\nWhile the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, has described the failure of the doctors to comply with the court order directing them to suspend their strike, the striking doctors say they will continue the strike until their minimum demands are met.\n\nReacting to claims by NARD that it would not suspend the strike while speaking on a television programme, \u2018Politics Today, Ngige said, \u201cThat is contemptuous. That is contempt of the court decision.\n\n\u201cWe will not bow down against contempt but I\u2019m not interested in those things. It is the Minister of Health and Attorney-General that can be looking into those things. My take is to invite them back and show them the degree of implementation of the MoU they signed in my office. They refused to sign but their parent body, NMA signed, consultants association signed, and others.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President of NARD, Dr. Dare Ishaya said strike actions are a last resort when the government fails to honour agreements after repeated negotiations.\n\n\u201cAt our end, this leadership, through robust collaboration, will work to envisage, present and solve challenges well ahead of time. However, if antecedents are anything to go by, the most important solution to incessant strike actions in the health sector will be a show of commitment from the government especially by increasing funding to the sector and also honouring their promises and agreements with health workers.\n\n\u201cWe are a new leadership, but we have to hit the ground running in a bid to solve the problems that are at hand. We plan to meet with all the stakeholders, appraise and resolve the issues. We think it\u2019s time to sit down together and begin a rollback, and redirection to the path of finding solutions rather than creating more technicalities.\n\n\u201cOn our side, we stated in our press briefing following our Annual General Meeting held last week in Bauchi that the Federal Government should reverse the unnecessary actions they took during this period of the strike which includes withholding of August and September 2021 salaries and also withdrawal of the court case instituted against our association.\n\n\u201cThe government should also commence payment of the Medical Residency Training Fund and also salary arrears of resident doctors owed on the GIFMIS platform,\u201d he told PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nAccording to Ishaya, resident doctors under the employment of Abia, Imo, Ekiti, and Ondo State Governments who are currently being owed 20, six, and four months salaries respectively, should be paid.\n\n\u201cIf these are done, it will show the government\u2019s commitment to the welfare of our members and we will reciprocate the gesture by ending the strike action.

The look of relief on the faces of community members who attend our annual health fair is long-lasting.\n\n\u201cThe hope created in the lives of families when they realise they can walk into any hospital of their choices and get medical attention without spending a dime leaves a lasting positive impression.\n\nSo, my principle remains that we give, not because we have a lot, but because we know what it is like not to have, and by extension, we know what the implications are, of not having in our society,\u201d he added, Congratulating the Immediate Past President Ezenwa Opara and his Board, for a very successful year, he said his strategies to keep the club going were commendable.\n\n\u201cI would also like to congratulate each of the new members on their election into the Board as I appeal that we continue with the same energy, enthusiasm, and commitment that have so far been displayed as we offer true service to humanity in order to change lives in this Rotary year.",

          "text": "Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, on Friday, described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Independence Day speech to Nigerians as a message \u201cfilled with inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nFrank who is the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, in a statement in Abuja, lamented that Buhari\u2019s speech is tantamount to rewriting history by twisting facts which are already well known by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe also accused the president\u2019s administration since 2015 to be replete with \u201cnepotism, divisiveness and ethnic bigotry,\u201d adding that the President \u201cattempted to pull wool over the faces of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that \u201cthe country which had been on a steady growth and development since 1960, through the spirited efforts of successive administrations, did not only stall since 2015 upon Buhari\u2019s ascension to power but has continued to retrogress irretrievably in all measurable economic, social and political indices.\u201d\n\nThe Bayelsa-born political activist said: \u201cFirst, Buhari praised the Armed Forces for their gallantry in curtailing the murderous activities of Boko Haram insurgents, Fulani herdsmen, bandits and other criminal elements, yet, this is the same military that have failed to stop incessant attacks on their formations, killing of its personnel and kidnapping of its Generals across the country.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy, killing of two officers and kidnap of Major Christopher Datong is a case in point.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s currency exchanged for about N180 to a dollar when Buhari took over power, but his administration created multiple foreign exchange rate windows. What is the exchange rate today? About N567 to a dollar at the parallel market and N410 at the official window!\n\n\u201cWhat was the price of fuel, cooking gas and electricity tariff when Buhari assumed office in 2015 and how much are Nigerians paying for these essential commodities today?\n\n\u201cNigeria was the fastest growing economy in Africa following the rebasing of the nation\u2019s economy under President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration. Today, Nigeria is the Poverty Capital of the World. However, Buhari would want the world to believe that his regime has recorded appreciable economic revival in the country.\n\n\u201cInsurgency was largely confined to the Northeast states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa when Buhari took over, but today farmers in Buhari\u2019s home state of Katsina and Northwest states of Kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, including Niger in the North Central pay taxes to bandits to be allowed access to their farms.\n\n\u201cToday most schools in the Northwest states have been shut down while telecommunication networks have been switched off in Zamfara, Kaduna and Sokoto states as a result of the activities of rampaging bandits and insurgents who have taken to kidnapping innocent school children for ransom. Yet Buhari praises his administration\u2019s efforts at curtailing insecurity. In Southern Kaduna, killing of innocent villagers has continued unabated.\n\n\u201cToday, Buhari and his administration have turned a once peaceful South East region bubbling with commercial activities to another haven of insurgency and gruesome killings due to the cluelessness with which it handled legitimate protests and agitations by youths in that region.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Dr. Chike Akunyili who was husband to late Professor Dora Akunyili recently fell victim of that heightened orgy of violence now ravaging the South East.\n\n\u201cNo doubt that the wanton killing of innocent Igbo youths has now snowballed into undreamt of killing spree by Unknown Gun Men. But to Buhari, all is well!\n\n\u201cBuhari said his administration has uncovered the financiers of secessionist movements in the South East and South West, but because of nepotism, he failed to name the sponsors of Boko Haram and bandits in the North even when the United Arab Emirates has since named the financiers of these dreaded groups.\n\n\u201cFor Buhari, it is easy to name a Federal Lawmaker as a financier of secessionist agitation in South East, but not easy to identify Boko Haram sponsors in the North. What manner of ethnic chauvinism!\n\n\u201cBuhari should bear full responsibility for turning the South East into a terrorist zone like Borno, Yobe and Adamawa as well as Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Kebbi and Niger and Sokoto states.\n\n\u201cBuhari said that the unity of Nigeria is non-negotiable but failed to add that his elevation of nepotism to state policy where he has made sure that 95 per cent of all government appointees are either Muslims or from the North West has been the fuel driving demands for self-determination from other regions,\u201d Frank concluded.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja; Osagie Otabor, Akure; Kolade Adeyemi, Jos; Simon Utebor, Yenagoa; Oyebola Owolabi, Lagos; Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt; Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin; Augustine Okezie Katsina; From Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan; Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta; Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\nNigerian embassy receives One Nigeria Group in Washington D.C.\n\n22 pardoned in Ondo, Plateau\n\nSenate President, governors preach messages of hope\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNigerians all over the world, on Friday, celebrated the 61st anniversary of the nation with fanfare and messages of hope.\n\nIn Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari led other Nigerians to mark the anniversary.\n\nThe President reviewed a military parade, leading an array of dignitaries to honour the country.\n\nHe arrived at the Eagle Square, Abuja, venue of the event, and was received by senior government officials, before being approached by the Parade Commander, Lt. Col. Salim Hassan, for permission to commence the parade.\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), led the long list of other senior officials of the government to watch the anniversary parade.\n\nThe Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila; the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Muhammad; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha; Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, were among those at the event.\n\nAlso present at the ceremony were former President Goodluck Jonathan; former Head of State, General Abdulsalamu Abubakar (rtd); former First Lady, Dr. Patience Jonathan; ministers, other government officials.\n\nThe event also had traditional rulers, the labour unions, paramilitary organisations and others in attendance.\n\nMeanwhile, security was beefed up around the Central Business District of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), where the Eagle Square, venue of the ceremony, is located.\n\nAs at 2pm on Thursday, through early hours of Friday, all entry points leading to the venue of the ceremony were cordoned off.\n\nSecurity personnel drawn from the Nigerian Police, Army, DSS, NSCDC officials among others were seen mounting guard at various entry points to the venue.\n\nMost participants and top dignitaries who attended the event were subjected to screening at the entry point to the Eagle Square.\n\nThe event which ended at noon was largely hitch free.\n\n18 inmates get pardon in Ondo\n\nGovernor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, on Thursday granted state pardon to 18 convicted inmates serving term in various Correctional centres across the state.\n\nA total of 26 death row inmates had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nChief Press Secretary to Governor Akeredolu, Richard Olatunde, in a statement, said the convicts were released having shown remorse and good conduct at the correctional centres.\n\nThe statement charged the freed inmates to be of good conduct and live a crime-free life.\n\nIn a statewide Independence Day broadcast, Governor Akeredolu called for urgent restructuring of the country to reflect the diversity and address the various misunderstandings as well as the high rate of criminality in the country.\n\nAkeredolu noted that the current system adopted in the county does not encourage ingenuity.\n\nHe warned that the country faces serious challenges bordering on redefinition.\n\nAkeredolu said the unique diversity that was supposed to be a source of strength was gradually becoming the country\u2019s albatross.\n\nReprieve for four in Plateau\n\nIn the spirit of independence, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State on Friday pardoned four inmates for exhibiting good conduct while serving in the correctional center.\n\nThose who were granted pardon are: Obinna John, Sagir Mukaila, Teryile Ishi and Daniel Honok.\n\nLalong in his independence message to the people of Plateau said nepotism, indiscipline, intolerance and corruption are the major bane for Nigeria under development.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIndependence Anniversary and in exercise of the powers conferred on me as Governor in Section 212 of the Constitution of The Federal Republic Of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended), after due consultation with The State Advisory Council On Prerogative Of Mercy, I have granted absolute pardon to four (4) Prisoners serving jail terms having been convicted for various offences.\n\n\u201cLet us therefore ask ourselves what has stagnated our progress and made us operate below our capacity. \u201c\n\nBayelsa has made good progress at 25 \u2013 Diri\n\nBayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has urged Bayelsans to appreciate God for the creation of the state as it has witnessed remarkable development in 25 years of its existence.\n\nDiri stated this on Friday in a statewide broadcast to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61st and Bayelsa State 25th anniversary aired on all the major stations in Yenagoa.\n\nThe governor noted that although the state had not developed to the level it desired to be, it had witnessed appreciable growth in terms of human and infrastructure development compared to when it was part of the old Rivers State.\n\nWhile calling on all sons and daughters of the state to close ranks and support his administration to move the state forward, Diri stressed that there was no other state they could call theirs, urging them to avoid acts that would pull the state backward.\n\nWhile giving an overview of achievements of the state within 25 years of creation, the governor said Bayelsa now has established higher institutions that are producing quality graduates, constructed and dualised several roads linking seven local government areas as well as connected to the national grid and also has a functional airport, which commercial flight operations commenced on August 19, 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t lose hope, Sanwo-Olu tells Nigerians\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has admonished Nigerians not to lose hope despite the many challenges confronting the people of the nation. \u201cMy message to every Nigerian is that we have no reason to lose hope. While we are not where we would like to be as a country and a people, we are also no longer where we used to be.\u201d\n\nHe re-assured Lagos residents that the government is doing everything possible to ensure the security of life and property. He said all hands are on deck to make the dream a reality.\n\nSanwo-Olu, speaking yesterday at Agege Stadium during the 61st Independence Parade, promised that the government would continue to make the environment conducive for businesses to ensure economic development.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we celebrate today, we are mindful of the various challenges confronting us as a nation and as a state. But we are equally mindful of the various vistas of progress that have opened up, and which continue to give us hope that we can achieve the Nigeria of our dreams.\n\n\u201cEven in the face of the many challenges confronting us as a people and as a nation, my message to every Nigerian is that we have no reason to lose hope. There is enough evidence that shows that while we are not where we would like to be, we are also no longer where we used to be. More than ever before, it is time for all of us to close ranks and view our differences as an energising force, and unite with renewed determination and commitment to move this country forward against all odds.\n\n\u201cThe challenges we have been confronted with in the last 61 years have been daunting, but certainly not insurmountable. A new mindset is required to overcome them; a conviction that it is possible, and that our strength truly lies in our diversity.\n\n\u201cI am proud to affirm that Lagos State provides a perfect example, within the Nigerian nation, of the level of greatness a people of diverse ethnic, religion and cultural background can attain if they resolve to live together in peace and harmony.\n\n\u201cI assure you that nothing is more important to this administration than ensuring the security of lives and property across the metropolis. No stone is being left unturned to ensure that culprits are brought to justice and, importantly, ensure we are able to act preventively and nip crime and criminality in the bud.\n\nWe believe in one Nigeria, says Wike\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that the belief of the state in one, united Nigeria is the reason it will not stop demanding a better country.\n\nSpeaking at the March Pass and Parade to commemorate the 61st Independence of Nigeria in Port Harcourt on Friday, the governor also suggested convocation of a national dialogue to evolve new peaceful, united and prosperous Nigeria based on justice and equity.\n\nHe said the National Assembly would stand condemned by the people and God if it at least failed to yield to overwhelming demands of Nigerians for electronic transmission of election results.\n\nRecounting the success of his administration, Wike said: \u201cBecause of our belief in one Nigeria, our state will never cease to demand the remaking of the country to reflect true and fiscal federalism, devolution of more powers and resources to States and local governments.\n\n\u201cAbove all, we must defend the basic structures of democracy and good governance by rising up to protect our right to free, fair and credible elections by demanding for the immediate incorporation of electronic voting and simultaneous transmission of results into our electoral system, which the nation\u2019s electoral management body has repeatedly said, it has both the capacity, commitment and infrastructure to effect, if only the National Assembly would allow.\u201d\n\nHe said the people\u2019s demand had nothing to do with politics or sentiments, but had a lot to do with the survival of the country, which he said remained superior to all other considerations.\n\nWike said there should be a total reformation of the repressive police system to allow for effective governor\u2019s oversight, control and funding at the state level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have spent the last six years laying the most concrete foundations for rapid economic growth and put the entire State on the path to a prosperous future.\n\n\u201cOur economy has grown far beyond the national average and is expected to accelerate even further in the coming years with the measures we have put in place, including fiscal discipline, improved revenue generation and massive provision of infrastructure as long as the nation maintains an appreciable level of macro-economic stability.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the National Assembly abandoned its check and balance roles over the executive, while the judiciary had lost its courage, integrity, and commitment to justice.\n\nNigeria full of potential, Kwara governor\n\nKwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said that in spite of the current challenges, Nigeria remains great and full of potential.\n\nThe governor said this in his Independence Day anniversary\u2019s speech.\n\nSaid Mallam Abdulrazaq: \u201cI join Mr. President and the rest of the country to felicitate our compatriots, especially the people of Kwara State, on the 61st independence anniversary. There is no pretending that our country is undergoing a truly challenging phase in national development. However, I am upbeat that we will emerge better, stronger, more united and prosperous as a people.\n\n\u201cWe may not be where we want to be, but our country is definitely neither stagnant nor hopeless. With more doses of unity, patriotism, discipline, positive disposition, and belief in the strength of our diversity and ingenuity as a people, we will attain our full potential as the largest nation of black people in the world.\n\n\u201cI therefore congratulate Mr. President, identify with and acknowledge his strides in infrastructural development, and the efforts to curtail insecurity while fostering national peace and stability. Kwara people and our administration will always show a good example in how to live and grow together in peace and harmony.\u201d\n\nMasari decries divergent tendencies, conflicts\n\nGovernor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, yesterday called on Nigerians to work towards nation building and remain steadfast for a strong country that is devoid of constant conflict with one another as a result of divergent tendencies.\n\nMasari who made the call in a statement signed by the Director General, Media and Publicity, Abdu Labaran Malumfashi, as part of activities marking Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary, said amidst daunting security challenges, Nigerians should remain steadfast in their belief for a strong and united Nigeria.\n\nHe said\u201d for Nigeria to develop into the country of our dream, we should make no room for tendencies that will exploit our fault lines and pitch one section against another in a needless confrontation\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the nation ages, our attitude should reflect the journey which has brought us this far together, and the reason behind the journey, \u201d he said.\n\nMasari further expressed worry at the tendency by Nigerians to regard the travails of the section of the country with \u201dlackadaisical attitude\u201d, adding that such attitude is not helpful to the collective interest of the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the race towards building a better, stronger and united nation, we should not allow divisive sentiments to put us asunder\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe would do well to realize that whatever affects one part of Nigeria affects all of Nigeria, and it is in the interest of us all to collectively face any challenge affecting a section of the country, as doing otherwise will only give room for adversity to envelope the whole country\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet us also put aside our different tongues and creeds and confront our challenges as Nigerians\u201d.\n\nHe called for more support to President Muhammadu Buhari, to enable him succeed in repositioning the country towards the path of sustainable development.\n\nMakinde calls for more support for state, nation\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Friday called on all citizens and residents of the state to join hands with the government to make the state and Nigeria as a whole a better and proud giant of Africa.\n\nThis is as he urged the people to remain loyal and proud of the country even in the face of the myriads of challenges facing the nation.\n\nThe governor spoke as he led other top government functionaries, Service Commanders, traditional leaders, religious leaders, community leaders, socio cultural groups, youth groups, students amongst others on the 61st National Independence Day Celebration.\n\nThe anniversary celebration, with the theme: \u2018Impact of Insecurity on the Economic Development of the Nation\u2019 took place at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital city.\n\nThe celebration which kick-started with a parade by officers and men of the Police Force, was followed by march past by primary and secondary school students, voluntary youth organisations, workers\u2019 unions, and the paramilitary.\n\nSpeaking, Governor Makinde, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Olubamiwo Adeosun, said security is everyone\u2019s business and the people must as such cooperate with security operatives.\n\nHe assured the government would not relent in its efforts to ensure that the state does not divert from the path of greatness and development of the people.\n\nSpeaking further on the theme, the governor pledged his unflinching support to both conventional and unconventional security agencies operating in the state in a bid to achieve a more secured Oyo state.\n\nMakinde said: \u201cWe have all seen a very beautiful parade and have made history today. Today is the 61st independence anniversary of Nigeria and we are celebrating it in a beautiful brand new stadium. I am sure that it was a beautiful experience for the children and for all those who paraded.\n\n\u201cIf you compare this stadium today to the way we have used it in the last twenty or thirty years, I am sure you can see that the difference is very clear.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate Nigeria today, I\u2019ll like every one of us to tap our chest with joy and be proud to be Nigerians because there is a lot to be proud about being Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAnd we all need to remember that we will do it together; the government and the good people of Oyo State will make our state and Nigeria better.\u201d\n\nGovernment functionaries in attendance include: Chief of staff, Segun Ogunwuyi; Deputy Chief of Staff, Abdul Mojeed Mogbonjubola; Oyo State Head of Service, Alhaja Amidat Agboola.\n\nThe list also include the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi (III), the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Soliu Adetunji and other notable traditional rulers in the state.\n\nThe highlight of the celebration is the distribution of prizes to winners of the march past and essay writing and debate competitions organised to mark the anniversary celebration.\n\nAbiodun preaches unwavering faith In Nigeria\n\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has called for an unwavering commitment to Nigeria and all that is Nigerian, saying despite all the challenges, the country has recorded many achievements.\n\nCiting the education sector as one of the areas where the country has witnessed growth, Abiodun said that with just one university at independence, Nigeria now has almost 200 universities, urging Nigerians to stand firm for what is noble, edifying and wholesome as well as fight those ills that have shackled and held the country back.\n\nHe spoke at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Abeokuta, the state capital while delivering his speech to mark this year\u2019s independence anniversary celebration which was attended by organised labour unions, associations, students, government officials among others.\n\nAbiodun called on the nation\u2019s youth to make themselves active participants in shaping the present future Nigeria of their desires, nothing that enormous responsibility is now on them to build a new Nation that works for ever Nigerian, regardless of tribe, religion, political affiliation, and geographical location.\n\nHe said : \u201c\u2026Let me particularly call on our youth. You are the worthy inheritors of a glorious past, active participants in shaping the present and indeed the generation that owns the future.\n\n\u201cThe people who own the future must be active participants in the process of building the future they desire. The journey to Greater Nigeria begins with you.\n\n\u201cYou must be part of the crop of the new Nigerians from all nooks and crannies of this country, who take the best of the past into the future whilst leaving behind the disempowering vestiges and narratives.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you to continue to be self-assured, creatively-inclined, open-minded, patriotic and be of strong character. The task of a new Nigeria rests squarely on your shoulders, and I have no doubt that, working together as one people, you can and will change the narrative of our dear nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe successive leaders have tried their best, now you have the enormous responsibility to build a new Nation that works for every Nigerian, regardless of tribe, religion, political affiliation, and geographical location. WE CAN do it. Together: Come, Let us build.\n\n\u201cI see hope for the future of Nigeria in you, our youths. You are the SUCCESSOR GENERATION, a generation we have hope and faith in. I see hope in shining stars like Faith Odunsi, the winner of the Global Open Mathematics Competition and many others in her kind.\n\n\u201cI see hope in our different young Ogun laureates who consistently do us proud in different academic and other competitions such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). I see hope in our various medalists at other global competitions.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the results of our young Agric-preneurs. In fact, I see hope in the energy and creative genius of our youth who as scientists, sports men and women; songsters and artists contribute to our visibility in the new world order.\n\n\u201cYour bustling energies and resourcefulness should provide for us a new pathway for a great country. Do not let anyone discourage you. Your age is an advantage to our national development. \u201c\n\nSenate President charges politicians, Nigerians to embrace peace, unity\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan on Friday charged politicians and other stakeholders in the country to always preach peace to their followers for the unity, stability and progress of the country as one entity.\n\nHe spoke after the special Jumaat prayer to mark the 61st independence of Nigeria.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to unite for the progress of the country and to continue to keep faith in their fatherland\n\n\u201cThis is the first year of our seventh decade as a nation and also the second year of the third decade of the Fourth Republic. I find it remarkable that we are living in the longest era of democracy in our history as a nation.\n\n\u201cThat may seem modest as an achievement but it is an additional cause for celebration in the light of our political experience,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nHe said every patriot will always remember with pride the historic moment on October 1, 1960, when the British Union Jack was lowered and the Green-White-Green flag hoisted in its place.\n\nHe noted that it is up to the leadership, the political leadership in particular across the country to ensure that they do the right thing by passing the right message to their followers.\n\nThe Senate President further urged that nobody should feel less Nigerian wherever he or she has decided to stay once that person is a citizen of the country.",

          "text": "By Bisi Oladele, Ibadan and Elo Edremoda, Warri\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThere was rage across the land on Friday as groups and individuals reacted to the Independence Day broadcast of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAmong the groups who reacted angrily to the broadcast were the Yoruba socio-political organisation Afenifere, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Yoruba nation agitation group Ilana Omo Oodua.\n\nAfenifere said the speech was evidence that the President was not in touch with reality, PANDEF said the speech echoed bigotry and nepotism while the Ilana Omo Oodua said the speech exposed him as a northern president.\n\nIn a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi,\n\nAfenifere said the picture painted by President Buhari of the Nigeria situation was at variance with the reality.\n\nThe group said the President\u2019s broadcast further showcased the dishonesty on the part of those that are governing the country and the disconnection between them and the people.\n\nDrawing a parallel between what the President said last year and what was contained in this year\u2019s speech, Ajayi said: \u201cIn the 16th paragraph of his 2020 independence anniversary speech, the President conceded that the country\u2019s major institutions \u2013 and by implication, the services they were supposed to render to the nation \u2013 were on the decline.\n\n\u201cIn his words: \u2018Institutions such as civil service, police, the judiciary, the military all suffered from a general decline.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the Afenifere spokesman, \u201cthere is no indication on ground that this assessment given last year by the President has changed for the better.\n\n\u201cThe services being rendered to the people of Nigeria by these institutions continue to be on the decline in terms of value delivery. The reason for this being lack of requisite resources and motivation.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unfair on the part of the President to accuse \u2018critics\u2019 of misdiagnosing \u2018incremental progress as stagnation\u2019 as he did in his 2021 independence anniversary speech.\u201d\n\nThe organisation further said that the President\u2019s claim that a lot has been achieved in the last six years \u201cin infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community\u201d is against the reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a time in the annals of modern Nigeria that the country\u2019s infrastructure was this decadent, social care near-absent and the image of the country so battered.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the difference between now and in the days of the late Sani Abacha was that the head of state then was wearing Khaki while the present head of government wears civilian dress and there are democratic institutions like the legislature that were absent then.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the country\u2019s influence in Africa, how many countries in Africa now respect Nigeria going by the inhuman treatments Nigerians are subjected to in different parts of the world including Africa these days?\u201d\n\nIn the area of economy, Afenifere said Nigerians have never had to pay through their noses for services and commodities as they are now forced to do.\n\nIt noted: \u201cAs at the time President Buhari assumed office in 2015, a bag of rice was around N7,000 while a US dollar exchanged for about N180 even in the black market.\n\n\u201cToday, a bag of rice is almost N30,000 while a dollar exchanges for nearly N600. The situation was so bad that Nigeria has been declared as the world capital of poverty.\n\n\u201cWhat is the justification therefore for the President\u2019s claim that the lot of the poor in the country is better under his administration than it was under the previous administration?\u201d\n\nAfenifere also picked holes in the President\u2019s claim that \u201cno government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\u201d\n\nIt said: \u201cHis administration was actually the one that has taken Nigeria off the track, going by the quantum of indebtedness the country now carries without much to show for the heavy debt, the level of disunity and mistrust among Nigerians, the hopelessness among the youths and the elderly and the collapse of the social services such as education, health and transport.\n\n\u201cThe President is also not fair to Nigerians by comparing the selling price of fuel to that of countries like Saudi Arabia, Ghana, etc since the purchasing power parity is not the same and social welfare in these countries is far ahead of that of Nigeria \u2013 which has virtually none.\u201d\n\nAfenifere also called on the President to be more sincere and live up to his words that his administration will listen to the people.\n\nQuoting President Buhari where he said \u201cwe shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country,\u201d Ajayi said there are many instances in which the Buhari-led government had shown that the people did not matter.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome instances that can be immediately cited are various court judgments that the government spurned once these judgments are not in its favour, various agreements it reached with trade unions and failed to honour, and government policies that the people kicked against but the government went ahead or tried to go ahead to impose them.\n\n\u201cAmong these were the increase in VAT, increase in petroleum prices, re-opening of the phantom grazing routes, herdsmen colony, transmission of elections results through electronic means, etc.\u201d\n\nTo Afenifere, the greatest area in which the government has failed in recent times is security. \u201cWhatever infrastructure government put in place, it is only those who are alive and in good condition that can enjoy these things.\n\n\u201cBut how can those who have been killed, kidnapped or maimed by terrorists enjoy those infrastructures the President is thrilled to say that his government is putting in place?\u201d he wondered.\n\nThe socio-political organisation said it was heartwarming that the President promised to \u201clisten to all and protect democracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne sure way to do this is do away with impunity, nepotism, be more sincere in its tackling of security challenges in the country and, above all, allow restructuring to take place so that peoples of Nigeria can sit down and decide on the modality for their continued staying together in a United Nigeria that is truly federal.\u201d\n\nSpeech echoes bigotry, nepotism, says PANDEF\n\nThe Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) is of the opinion that the Independence Day speech of President Buhari smacks of the \u201cbigotry and nepotism\u201d of the current administration.\n\nThat much was contained in a statement made available by the group\u2019s national publicity secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, yesterday.\n\nThe statement, which described the President\u2019s address as one of the worst ever made in Nigeria\u2019s history, posited that it did not reflect the mood and situation of the citizenry.\n\nWhile taking a swipe at the President\u2019s speechwriters, the group queried Buhari\u2019s silence on the sponsors of Boko Haram, bandits and herdsmen, and the swift announcement that sponsors of secessionist leaders, Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho, had been identified.\n\nPANDEF said: \u201cThe speech was indifferent to the mood of the country; the growing disaffections, dissensions and disillusions arising from the actions and inactions of the government.\n\n\u201cRather, it is full of hallucinations and wishful thinking, perhaps based on what might be pleasing to the President and not the citizens.\n\n\u201cThere is something wrong with the President\u2019s speechwriters and handlers. They offend citizens\u2019 sensibilities in their ridiculous, tenuous justification of the colossal failure of the administration. They are either making excuses or playing the blame game; it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault.\n\n\u201cHow can they say it is hoarding by \u2018middlemen\u2019 that is responsible for the current food crisis in the country?\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, no mention was made of the killer herdsmen, bandits and insurgents who are destroying farms and hunting farmers away from their farmlands across the country. Of course, they are untouchables!\n\n\u201cThe assertion that the government is taking the fight against insecurity to the enemy and winning is also odd. How?\n\n\u201cA few days ago, gunmen, reportedly, again, invaded Sarkin Pawa, headquarters of Munyan Local Government Area of Niger State, killing no fewer than 30 people.\n\n\u201cBandits also, allegedly, overran a joint military base in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State, killing some security personnel last week.\n\n\u201cAnd, last Sunday, suspected Boko Haram insurgents also reportedly attacked a community in Yobe State. The incident, which caused many of the villagers to flee, came a month after the terrorists launched a similar assault on the community.\n\n\u201cReports of the horrendous activities of bandits, insurgents and herders are upsetting and terrifying. So what \u2018fight against insecurity\u2019 is the government winning? Is it the fight against Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu?\n\n\u201cThat explains why they easily can declare to have identified sponsors of Igboho and Kanu but remain silent on sponsors of the insurgents, bandits and killer herders who are the true enemies of the country. It\u2019s a shame.\n\n\u201cThis independence day speech reverberates the bigotry and nepotism of the Buhari administration. And that\u2019s Nigeria\u2019s greatest problem today.\u201d\n\nYoruba nation agitation group flays speech\n\nYoruba nation agitation group, the Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) Worldwide yesterday faulted President Buhari\u2019s Independence Day speech on Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nA statement issued by the Communications Secretary of the group, Maxwell Adeleye on behalf of Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, tasked President Buhari to name the National Assembly member he alleged was sponsoring Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cBuhari has further exposed himself as the President of the North and not that of Nigerians. He has succeeded in emboldening us more to fight on in the agitation for self-determination for the Yoruba people,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt added: \u201cIt is total nonsense that Buhari is bothered about a Sunday Igboho who is engaged in a lawful agitation, endorsed and confirmed now by a court of competent jurisdiction, United Nations and African Union Declarations on Peoples and Human Rights while he (Buhari) looked away on the murderous activities of the Fulani Herdsmen Terrorists and Miyyetii Allah in the South and Middle-Belt Territories.\n\n\u201cMr. President said an unknown sitting member of the Nigerian National Assembly is involved in the funding of Sunday Igboho. That\u2019s absolute mendacity. The Yoruba people from villages to villages to the Diaspora are contributing their hard-earned resources to oil and sustain the agitation.\n\n\u201cOur appeal to Buhari is to, as a matter of urgency, name the invincible National Assembly member so that the Yoruba People can celebrate him, because he is supporting a NOBLE STRUGGLE.\n\n\u201cIf indeed such a National Assembly member exists unknown to us in Ilana Omo Oodua, we say very expressly that he is a hero that has chosen to stand by a legitimate, legal and constitutional agitation. Therefore, Buhari is merely grandstanding.\n\n\u201cAs Buhari named the unknown National Assembly member, our utmost appeal to him is to help Nigerians in naming those funding murderous Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram terrorists oppressing, maiming, killing and raping his people in the North and the people of the South and Middle-Belt with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe entire speech of Buhari symbolises hopelessness and chaos. It was a declaration of war against the peace-loving people of Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cOur message to him is that we shall not be intimidated. We shall remain loyal and committed to our struggle for an Independent Yoruba Nation. We shall be undaunted. No oppressor has ever triumphed over the people. In this struggle, we shall continue to be legitimate and peaceful. It is amandla awet. Nothing shall discourage us.\u201d\n\nIndependence Day speech a mockery, says activist\n\nAlso reacting to President Buhari\u2019s speech yesterday, rights activist and convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, wondered that while President Muhammadu Buhari spoke of the discovery of alleged sponsors of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, he failed to do same about the sponsors of Boko Haram terrorists and bandits who have killed thousands of Nigerians and displaced millions.\n\nAdeyanju also said the President needed prayers for claiming that his administration has performed better than previous democratic governments since 1999.\n\nAccording to him, the Northwest Nigeria and the Middle Belt have been completely ravaged by terrorism and banditry, yet the President praised the Army for its failure to combat these criminals.\n\nIn a statement titled \u2018Buhari mocked Nigerians with his Independence Day speech\u2019, Adeyanju said: \u201cIt is beyond sad to hear President Buhari commending the military for failure in his Independence Day speech.\n\n\u201cThe North West, North Central and almost the entire country is almost a NO-GO AREA due to widespread insecurity. Terrorist groups control over 10 local government areas in the President\u2019s home state of Katsina and collect taxes from residents openly and unchallenged.\n\n\u201cSo many people who were killed by terrorists in Southern Kaduna were buried yesterday. Dora Akunyili\u2019s husband was gunned down recently in the South-East. Yet the President praises the military for failure.\n\n\u201cThe President also said he has discovered sponsors of IPOB and Oduduwa agitators but failed to talk about sponsors of Boko Haram that Dubai revealed recently, because they are from his zone.\u201d",
          "summary": "Afenifere said the speech was evidence that the President was not in touch with reality, PANDEF said the speech echoed bigotry and nepotism while the Ilana Omo Oodua said the speech exposed him as a northern president.\nIn a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi,Afenifere said the picture painted by President Buhari of the Nigeria situation was at variance with the reality.\nIt noted: \u201cAs at the time President Buhari assumed office in 2015, a bag of rice was around N7,000 while a US dollar exchanged for about N180 even in the black market.\n\u201cThis independence day speech reverberates the bigotry and nepotism of the Buhari administration.\nIn a statement titled \u2018Buhari mocked Nigerians with his Independence Day speech\u2019, Adeyanju said: \u201cIt is beyond sad to hear President Buhari commending the military for failure in his Independence Day speech.",

          "text": "By Louis Ibah\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has restated his commitment to the unity of the country.\n\nIn his nationwide broadcast early this morning to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61st independent anniversary, he said the resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering warning that his \u201cgovernment was ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action.\u201d\n\nHe also said ongoing investigations on separatists agitators, Nnamdi Kalu and Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho), arrested recently, have revealed that a certain member of the National Assembly was among their financiers.\n\n\u201cNigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n\u201cThe recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers, including one identified as a serving member of the National Assembly. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\u201d\n\nBuhari also granted the conditional lifting of the ban on social media platform, Twitter, to allow citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\nWhile acknowledging the country\u2019s socio-economic and security challenges, the president said no government since 1999 could match what his administration had done in the last six years to put Nigeria back on track\n\nBelow are excerpts of the speech: \u201cIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n\u201cThe doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n\u201c I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIn the last four months, the gallant men and women of the military and security agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Various reactions including knocks, applause, hope, cautious optimism and cynicms have tried Nigeria at 61.\n\nFor the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), there is nothing worth celebration as it carpeted the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration as the worst in the country\u2019s history.\n\nIts spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, at press briefing, in Abuja, yesterday, claimed the Progressives Congress (APC)-led government has reversed all elements of an independent state.\n\n\u201cIt is painful that all the gains made by our nation since independence in 1960 and especially during the 16 years of the PDP in office, including the entrenchment of national unity and cohesiveness, freedom and personal liberty of citizens, rule of law, credible elections, justice, equity, fairness and economic progress; the very elements of an independent state, have all been reversed by the APC and the Buhari Presidency.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari Presidency and the APC have on all fronts taken our nation back to the pre-independence days with associated bondage mentality and frustration resulting in many losing faith in the system and leaving our country in droves within the last six years.\n\n\u201cIs it not an irony that our nation is celebrating independence in the face of subverted elections, brazen crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices as well as other suppressive acts including the muzzling of free speech as witnessed in the ban on Twitter in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cIs it not also an irony that as we celebrate independence, thousands of our compatriots are falling victims to extra-judicial killings, arbitrary arrests and illegal detention in dehumanizing cells; which underscore the horrible situation under President Buhari and the APC, as even profiled by reputable international organizations including Amnesty International (AI) and US Department of State?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we celebrate when the APC has plunged our nation into economic slavery with over N33.1 trillion accumulated debt, a 33 percent unemployment rate, collapse of productive sectors and a weakened naira from the N167 to a dollar handed over to President Buhari in 2015 to a dismal N576 to a dollar today?\n\n\u201c\u2026How can we celebrate when President Buhari and the APC have in a space of six years, wreaked our once robust economy and turned Nigeria into the poverty capital of the world, where over 82.9 million Nigerians can no longer afford their daily meals. Indeed, this is not the way to go. The incontrovertible truth is that there is no hope in sight under the APC and that is why there are no drums on the streets to celebrate Nigeria at 61.\u201d\n\n\u2022Nigeria\u2019ll remain united, stronger nation \u2013CAN\n\nRegardless of its challenges, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), said Nigeria would remain indivisible and wax stronger.\n\nIts President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, in a message of hope issued to Christians and Nigerians, Ayokunle also declared that \u201cNigeria shall experience Showers of Blessings.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said his prophesy was backed by the Book of Ezekiel 34:25-30, where Ezekiel prophesied to a people in captivity of the Babylonians that there shall be showers of blessings.\n\nAyokunle said the situation, humanly speaking, appeared bleak, but knowing that God is not man and with Him, all things are possible, this is the right time to believe that there shall be showers of blessings because some people are praying for this country.\n\n\u201cThere shall be showers of blessings because God shall judge the evil doers in the nation. There shall be showers of blessings because God rules in the affairs of humans. There shall be showers of blessings because the thoughts of God towards us are good and not evil.\u2019\u2019\n\nAyokunle, also Co-Chairman, Nigeria Inter-Religious Council, said the showers of blessings shall usher in peace to Nigeria and all agitations would cease.\n\nThe CAN president said the Lord would cause wild beasts and criminals operating with various names such as Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, murderous herdsmen, unknown gunmen to cease from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cViolence shall become a thing of the past in Nigeria and all Nigerians shall dwell in safety in the name of Jesus.\n\n\u201cOur economy shall flourish and there shall be prosperity in the nation and Nigerians who had run abroad will return home because Nigeria will be a desired nation by everybody in the name of Jesus,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nHe added that God shall turn Nigeria\u2019s dry land into swamps of food where Nigerians would have plenty to eat and the days of scarcity would be no more in the name of Jesus.\n\nHe prayed that at the forthcoming 2023 general elections, no wicked leader shall be voted into power no matter how wealthy and powerful he or she might be in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe CAN president commended the military for the current upper hand they were having over insurgents and criminals tagged bandits and wicked herdsmen murdering and sacking communities\n\n\u2022Lawmakers, CLO urge Buhari to tackle insecurity\n\nSome lawmakers in Lagos and Nasarawa states and the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe lawmakers also called on the president to address poverty, unemployment and separatist agitations.\n\nWhile Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, called on Nigerians to pray and support the president and other leaders to succeed in creating more democratic dividends, Chairman, Committee on Information and Strategies, Lagos State House of Assembly, Setonji David, urged the president to tackle poverty, unemployment, inflation and separatists agitations.\n\nChairman, Committee on Primary and Secondary Education, Sanni Okanlawon, also urged Nigerians to unite in the efforts to end insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe all have responsibilities to work towards the greatness of this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe CLO asked the political class and office holders to restore the nation to the ideals of its founding fathers.\n\nIts chairman in Anambra, Vincent Ezekwueme, said in spite of abundant human and natural resources bestowed on Nigeria, majority of its citizenry still live in abject poverty.\n\n\u201cThe best and greatest independent gift Nigerians expect from government at all levels includes but not limited to the eradication of poverty, inequality, unemployment, injustices, banditry, terrorism and all forms of insecurity in the land. It is only social justices that precipitate peaceful coexistence, unity, progress and prosperity,\u201d Ekwueme said.\n\n\u2022Lawan, Tinubu urge unity, faith\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, urged Nigerians to unite for the progress of the country and continue to keep faith with their fatherland.\n\n\u201cI find it remarkable that we are living in the longest era of democracy in our history as a nation. That may seem modest as an achievement but it is an additional cause for celebration in the light of our political experience,\u201d he said\n\nAccording to him, the challenges are numerous but not insurmountable.\n\n\u201cIf we face them like our founding fathers faced those of their time, the coming generations will also accord our memories their gratitude.\n\nLawan encouraged all Nigerians to take advantage of the ongoing process of constitutional review at the National Assembly.\n\nHe said the National Assembly was determined to facilitate a meaningful review of the Constitution by the people.\n\nIn her reaction, Senator Oluremi Tinubu emphasized that the things that bind the country together are stronger than those which threaten to divide it.\n\n\u201cWe must shun all attempts to cause disunity amongst us, and remain unflinching in spite of whatever challenges we may face.\u201d\n\nAccording to the senator representing Lagos Central, the nation\u2019s founding fathers have fought and played their part.\n\n\u201cNow, the responsibility rests on us, to safeguard, preserve, cherish and build a nation that future generations of Nigerians will be proud of.\u201d\n\n\u2022Kalu advocates sustenance of democratic virtues\n\nFormer fovernor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu, applauded Nigerians for their perseverance, patriotism and commitment to nation building.\n\nDescribing Nigeria as a blessed country, he called on the political class to embrace democratic virtues at all levels of government, adding that people at the helm of affairs must live up to expectations by providing succour to the people.\n\nThe former governor noted that the tribal, cultural and religious diversity of Nigeria should not be a basis for disunity rather an opportunity for growth and progress.\n\n\u201c I join other Nigerians in celebrating the 61st independence anniversary of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the country is facing some challenges, nevertheless, there are remarkable and historic milestones that have been achieved since independence.\n\n\u201cNigeria is waxing strong despite unpatriotic and selfish calls for division in some quarters. The country is blessed with its heterogeneous nature.\n\n\u201cThe proponents of a divided Nigeria are selfish and unpatriotic. The country remains a united, indivisible and prosperous nation.\n\n\u201cAs the country marks it 61st independence anniversary, the government and its citizens, must uphold the tenets of democracy in a bid to build an ideal society anchored on justice, fairness and equity.\n\nWhile charging politicians not to heat the polity with provocative utterances, he urged Nigerians to be law-abiding, optimistic and peaceful.\n\n\u2022Jonathan charges citizens to be optimistic of the future\n\nFormer president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, urged Nigerians to be optimistic about the future of the country.\n\nHe stressed that the nation holds abundant promises for the citizens, adding that Nigeria has what it takes to overcome its present threats and trials.\n\nHe encouraged the nation\u2019s leaders and the citizens to rededicate ourselves to the virtues of equity, justice and tolerance and strive to give their best for the good of the nation.\n\n\u201cWe may have hiccups along the way and challenging times that might be stretching our resolve and determination to forge ahead. But we should not relent nor succumb to fear, discouraging trials and threats of today. We will never lose hope in our country and in our indomitable spirit and capacity to overcome difficult times, seize the moment and conquer.\n\n\u201cThe journey of nationhood is a marathon, which requires patience, resilience, tolerance and determination. The uncertainties of this time cannot be compared to the limitless promises that this nation holds for us all.\n\n\u201cThis time offers us a new opportunity to renew our drive towards attaining greater heights and secure our shared dreams and common vision.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate, let us aggregate the successes, challenges and lessons of the last six decades and apply them towards a more prosperous future for us and upcoming generations.\u201d\n\n\u2022Abdulsalami: Be patriotic, disciplined\n\nFormer military head of state, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, said for the country to attain greatness, all citizens must work together and contribute their own quota in ensuring good democratic governance.\n\nHe said Nigerians must be carried along through the implementation of people oriented policies and programmes in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to attain greatness, we must become a disciplined society, respect and obey the constitution. Every Nigerian is expected to do their best by tolerating one another irrespective of tribe religious, ethnic and political affiliations. Nigerians must desist from sabotage and assist the government in its efforts to improve the well-being of the governed.\u201d\n\nHe also called on governments at all levels to discharge their responsibilities by providing infrastructure, adequate power supply and assisting farmers with farm inputs in order to make life easier for the people.\n\n\u201cNigerians must assist the security personnel with credible information that will enable them to arrest criminal elements living among us so that the security agencies can arrest and deal with them decisively. We must imbibe the culture of providing intelligence information to security personnel deployed across the country in the ongoing fight against banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Oyetola lauds Nigeria progress amidst challenges\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun said Nigeria may not have achieved the desired development height but is progressively moving toward achieving greater heights.\n\n\u201cBy any standard, we have moved, we may not have achieved the level that we are thinking of as a nation but I think we are moving.\u201d\n\nThe governor said comparing Nigeria with other nations might not necessarily be good enough because one might not know what those nations had.\n\nHe expressed optimism that Nigeria could do better given the present level of its development, following efforts put into running the country\u2019s affairs by President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nThe governor attributed the ability of his administration to pay salaries of civil servants to commitment and setting priorities right. He said there was no magic to it, stressing that it was a question of defining priorities and getting them right.\n\n\u2022Nigeria built on falsehood \u2013Gani Adams\n\nAare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams said Nigeria\u2019s federation was built on falsehood, adding that the country has the potentials to be great again if the regions are given the autonomy to develop at their own pace.\n\nHe said such would allow the states to build their security architectures to enhance the federal security architecture.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s history and efforts of the founding fathers before and shortly after independence in 1960 were watershed, but added that the past and present crop of leaders had drifted along the line by initiating policies capable of destroying the federation.\n\nThe Yoruba generalissimo wondered how a nation birthed with lots of hope and aspirations suddenly turned into a shadow of itself.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.\n\n\u201cMany would, no doubt, describe Nigeria as the giant of Africa but the irony is that Nigeria\u2019s federation was built on falsehood and that has affected the entire system. For instance, the spate of insecurity has reached an alarming state with bandits killing and maiming Nigerians everyday.\u201d",

He said it was not only in Southern Kaduna that people were being massacred, stressing that everywhere in the country, Nigerians were being killed.\n\n\u201cI learnt with pain the news of the armed attacks that took place last Sunday against the villages of Madamai Abun, in northern Nigeria. I pray for those who have died, for those who have been injured, and for the entire Nigerian population. I hope that the safety of all citizens in the country will always be guaranteed,\u201d the Pope said.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to provide adequate security for Nigerians in every part of the country.\n\nVarious parts of Nigeria, especially the North have experienced several years of violence, with herders and farmers competing for natural resources, while sporadic violence by gunmen often lead to endless reprisals between communities.\n\nSunday\u2019s attack in Kaduna took place in the village of Madamai, in the Kaura district, where \u201cunidentified gunmen\u201d killed scores of people and injured others. A second attack was carried out by militants in an alleged retaliation in the village of Kacecere, where a further eight people were killed, six injured, and several houses destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Catholic Bishops of Nigeria have appealed to Nigerians to respect human life, and strive for peace in a country based on justice and equity. They called on those in government to take sincere and positive steps to deliver the people from their tormentors.The bishops also appealed to Nigerians to pray against famine, killings and sufferings.\n\nThey stated this in a statement in Abuja by the National Director of Social Communications for the group, Fr. Mike Umoh.\n\nThe bishops added their voices to that of the Holy Father, Pope Francis, to appeal to those in government and those who have power, to desist from actions and policies that continue to plunge the nation into violence and crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that Nigerians are still literally dying every day through very barbaric and senseless killings.

          "text": "Citizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of Minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n*Being the full text of the of the 61st Independence Day Address by President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday 1st October, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Cross River Magistrate forcefully seized, impounded and sold a car belonging to a defendant\u2019s friend in order to recover money owed by the defendant.\n\nThe defendant in the case with suit No. IKM/RTM/12/2019, Mr. Loveday Eke had driven his friend\u2019s car to the courthouse on May 10, 2019 when his friend\u2019s car was seized, impounded and sold despite the car belonging to Mr. Edim Samuel Okpa.\n\nOn Wednesday, 27th March, 2019, judgment was given in Suit No. IKM/RTM/12/2019 in favor of Mrs. Florence Innocent that, Mr. Loveday Eke pay her \u201cN400,000 being arrears of two years rent, mense profit of N16,000 per month from January 2019 until possession and N15,000 for cost of action.\u201d\n\nJudgment that Mr. Loveday Eke is indebted to.\n\nUnable to meet up with the judgment, Mr. Loveday\u2019s properties valued at over N1.2 million, his friend\u2019s car (Toyota Camry, 2007 model) valued at N3.4 million was auctioned to recover the sum of N463,000. This action was taken despite the landlady agreeing to the pleas of the defendant by reducing the amount demanded to N200,000. Despite the agreement the Magistrate still auctioned off Mr. Loveday\u2019s properties, seized, impounded and sold Mr. Loveday\u2019s friend\u2019s car.\n\nEssentially, the action was taken to recover a balance of N50,000 from Mr. Loveday. People familiar with the nefarious activities of Magistrate Bassey Nsidieti Bassey, Registrar of Ikom Magistrate\u2019s Court told our correspondent in anonymity that this was his usual practice.\n\nMagistrate Bassey who led the gang to forcefully takeover and sell the car belonging to the budding businessman\u2019s friend, Mr. Edim is shielding another judgment debtor from paying Mrs. Scholastica Bisong N725,000.\n\nMrs. Scholastica got a judgement in her favor against one Mr. Isiaka Adeleke but couldn\u2019t enforce it because the defendant is the mechanic of the corrupt Court official, Magistrate Bassey. Judgment in favor of Mrs. Scholastica in Suit No. IKM/1/2020 dated 28th September, 2020.\n\nIn a attempt to radicle the Court, Mr. Isiaka filed a motion asking that he be permitted to service his judgment debt of N725,000 by N15,000 every month.\n\nIn 2018, the Registrar of Ikom Magistrate\u2019s Court was made a Magistrate, since then, he has played the role of a Magistrate (without a Court) and a Registrar, side-by-side. There are three Magistrate Courts in Ikom and three Magistrate manning them.\n\nSelective Judgment Enforcement\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t pay my rent and my landlady gave me quiet notice on a certain weekend that I was not at home, I was called that Court Administrative staff were in my house, I rushed back home and was told they have an order to bring my properties to Court.\u201d Mr. Loveday Eke narrates his ordeal to CrossRiverWatch.\n\nHe ran to plead with Magistrate but he refused to call his men off. While in the Court pleading for the release of his friend\u2019s car just impounded, his home was forcefully entered and swept clean of all valuable.\n\nEverything in his well furnished 3 bedroom apartment valued at over N1.2 million was swept away leaving him with just the trouser, shirt and footwear he was putting on. \u201cI ran to a friend and borrowed his car to run around, I raised N150,000 and took to him (Bassey), he directed I hand it over to the lawyer incharge of the property and I did, he gave me receipt for the N150,000 I paid, base on the agreement between me and my landlady.\u201d He revealed.\n\nConfirmation of receipt of N150,000 from Mr. Loveday Eke.\n\nRecounting how the Registrar deliberately intended to milk him, the young businessman disclosed that: \u201cHe said the money I have to pay is about N380,000 and must be in cash, when paying to my landlady, if she says her money is N200,000 the Court keeps the balance. I went there about a week later, he threatened me never to come there again else he will arrest me, my friend\u2019s car I drove there was impounded, two phones and other items in it were seized.\u201d\n\nThe car and other properties valued at over N4.5 million was auctioned because he questioned why he is to balance N230,000 instead of N50,000. The car was sold to a staff of Eco Bank, Jackson and he was arrested, the Registrar and his gang sold the car to someone else from Cameroon and instructed to move the car at once. Evidence that the Toyota Camry that was sold doesn\u2019t belong to Loveday, judgment debtor but Edim Samuel Okpa.\n\n\u201cI tracked the car to Cameroon, the person in possession of the car was arrested. Monday morning on reaching there with proof of ownership, I saw a lawyer (Barrister Ateke) with Court papers defending the suspect, I was rather arrested and detained in Cameroon for two days, I spent close to N120,000 before I got my freedom. That is how the story of the car ended,\u201d he said as tears wrinkled his eyes and he added after a pause, \u201cI went to a lawyer outside Ikom, he was threatened severally to drop the case. I tried by petition after filing a motion in Court on 17th of May, 2019 and it never came up, when it was scheduled finally for 30th May, 2019 and 13th June, 2019, it was never heard.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Loveday said: \u201cHe (Registrar Bassey) eventually confessed (to the crime) and called for a dialogue, he said he will get another car and told us that, the lawyers incharge of the property (Dennis and Mgboki) are part of the deal. He gave us a time frame to return everything but he has failed to do so.\u201d\n\nFebruary 8, 2019, Mrs. Scholastica Bisong paid Mr. Isiaka Adeleke N1,855,000 for a car, Toyota Camry, 2009 model. \u201cWhen he brought the car I rejected it because it was scrab. He went to Gboko and refurbished the car, sold it to the Registrar of Magistrate\u2019s Court Ikom, Bassey Nsidieti Bassey at N1.4 million and was paid to me in instalment.\u201d She told CrossRiverWatch.\n\n\u201cWhen the balance was not forthcoming I arrested him (Isiaka),\u201d she narrated adding that \u201cafter several failed promises, I took Isiaka to Court.\u201d His Worship, Solomon Ikongshul who presided over the case in suit No. IkM/1/2020 gave judgment on Monday, 28 September, 2020 in her favor.\n\nThe defendant was instructed to pay N455,000 being debt owed her from the balance of the initial sum of N1,855,000 for the purchase of the car. That N200,000 be paid as damages for breaching contract, while the sum of N50,000 as cost of action.\n\nThe Court directed that the sum amounting to N705,O00 should be paid in three installments: N235,000 per month, commencing from October, 2020 to December, 2020.\n\nAfter execution of the judgment was long overdue, on Monday, 22 March, 2021, Mr. Isiaka (judgement debtor) filed a motion praying for an order for installmental payment of the judgment sum of N705,000 only, in equal installments of N15,000 monthly. And an order for stay of execution in KM/1/2020.\n\nThe Court presided by His Worship, S. O. Oji ordered the applicant (Isiaka) to comply with the earlier judgment and pay the entire sum of N705,000. According to the Court, \u201cGoing by the Judgment Order, Exhibit A, it is my view that the Motion of Applicant was intended to delay payment, therefore the entire sum herein is due and payable forthwith. Cost is awarded at N20,000.\u201d Thus, making the total money owed Mrs. Scholastic N725,000 only.\n\nCourt order that arose from the motion Mr. Isiaka filed (IKM/MISC/164/2020) which went in favor of Mrs. Scholastic and his judgment debt increased to N725,000 only, six months after the judgment in Suit No. IKM/1/2020.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, 30 March, 2021 Registrar Bassey called me to his office that Isiaka brought N110,000, he collected it and handed over to me that by ending of April, he will pay the balance.\u201d She told CrossRiverWatch revealing that, \u201cWhen Court resumed in June after the strike, I went back to the Registrar and he demanded for N30,000 for execution, I paid.\u201d\n\nWeeks, months passed, no word from the Registrar and when she approached him only to be told that, \u201cIsiaka is his (Registrar) mechanic, he repairs Barrister Ojong and Barrister Eyong car as well, so they cannot enforce the judgment, he then told Isiaka to go and bring N50,000.\u201d\n\nThis investigation revealed that, the N30,000 the Registrar collected from her to aid enforce the judgment was transferred back (Thursday, 15 July, 2021) which confirms that, he won\u2019t execute the judgment. The next day, Friday, Mr. Isiaka brought the N50,000 which made it N160,000 of N725,000 he owed Mrs. Scholastica in judgment. N30,000 alert refunded by the Registrar to Mrs. Scholastica after he opened up to be pally with the judgment debtor, Mr. Isiaka.\n\nThe hope of getting justice by the two vocal victims and others who were too afraid to speak up has been dashed.\n\n\u2018Play Ball Or Have It Hot And Be Transferred\u2019\n\nSeveral Magistrates confided in CrossRiverWatch that in Ikom, you either play ball with the Registrar, His Worship, Bassey Nsidieti Bassey or have it hot and be transferred. Their identity are withheld for editorial reasons.\n\nHis Worship, Magistrate XYZ said, \u201cWhen judgement is given he does selective execution because of benefits and no one dare\u2019s question him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost senior lawyers don\u2019t like going to Magistrate\u2019s Court Ikom because they feel Magistrates\u2019 there take directives from him. Several lawyers and Magistrates have been given life threats not to take cases because of his interest, I was a victim.\u201d His Worship, Magistrate QRS disclosed.\n\nHis Worship, Magistrate UVW divulged that, \u201cHe has a way of forcing other Magistrates to sign blank arrest warrant when there is no complaint to arrest whoever he likes, then you sort out issues with him, pay him and no matter comes up in the Court, sometimes people are detained to get them to comply, I was a victim of this.\u201d\n\nOn his part, His Worship, Magistrate ABC said: \u201cWe might be forced to blank warrants and no case comes up from them, if you don\u2019t sign be prepared to have it hot and be transferred.\u201d\n\nHis Worship, Magistrate LMN aforesaid, \u201cWhen he became a Magistrate he was supposed to have been assigned a Court where he will preside over cases, but I don\u2019t know if he is the one or the authorities that has refused to assign a Court to him, he has remained functioning as a Registrar that he was.\n\n\u201cIf a Magistrate is to work as a Registrar it should be in a higher Court, not in the same Magistrate Court, maybe he is sent to a High Court, Appeal Court, Supreme Court but definitely, it is an abnormally for a Magistrate to remain functioning as a Registrar in a Magistrate Court.\u201d\n\n\u2018He\u2019s A Man Of gods [sic] And Guts\u2019\n\nA source within Ikom Magistracy who spoke to CrossRiverWatch under anonymity described the Registrar, His Worship, Bassey Nsidieti Bassey as \u201ca man of gods and guts.\u201d\n\nRecalling a past incident, he said: \u201cSome years ago there was a serious case involving him, the key witness who was to testify after failed efforts to bribe him off appearing, on the adjourned day, he was swollen that only his eyes could move, after a while he died and that closed the case.\n\n\u201cHe (Registrar) has broken homes because of eros, I know of two married men he sent to prison just to force their wives to bed, in this Ikom. Normally if you have judgement and you\u2019re meeting the Registrar to execute and he ask you to pay, the amount you paid will be added for you, but that money even if he recovers it from that person, he doesn\u2019t give to you, whatever he recovers he still take commission from you.\u201d\n\nHe went on to disclose that: \u201cHe does not follow due process in auctioning, go to his house in Ikom and Calabar, you will see pile of properties. He selects the ones he likes, auction the rest and gives you judgment credit of peanut, you will regret taking matter to Court. One Head Teacher\u2019s money was eaten by that man (the Registrar), until a letter was written through the High Court before he accepted paying that money, till date he has not paid all.\u201d\n\nOn more shady dealings, the insider said: \u201cIf you get the schedule Cross River State gives for filing charges, you prepare two documents, take one to Effraya (Etung) to file, same document bring to Ikom, that one will be N1,000 or N2,000, his own will be about N6,000 or N7,000, he does not issue receipt and nobody is asking him questions, his a lord on his own.\n\n\u201cHe decide on the Magistrate who seats or transferred, that is why petitions against him is buried. The Loveday issue is one I wept, he has settled with his landlady and you still auctioned his properties and a friend\u2019s car. In the case of Madam Scholastica, he has refused to execute the judgment but called for installmental payment, that doesn\u2019t satisfy the judgment and Isiaka sale cars, he owns a building here in Ikom.\u201d\n\nThe source who for fear of attack who doesn\u2019t want to be mentioned in print further revealed to this newspaper that he (the Magistrate) is connected up to the judiciary headquarters in Calabar, which is why petitions against him can be trashed without interfacing with the petitioner, \u201cas it happened in the case of Mr. Loveday who petitioned twice,\u201d he said.\n\nThere Are Procedures For Disciplining Magistrates, Complain To State Judicial Service Commission \u2013 Mba Ukweni, SAN\n\nWhen contacted on phone about what should be done in the circumstance of Mr. Loveday and Mrs. Scholastica, Mba Ukweni, SAN advised that \u201cthere is a procedure for disciplining Magistrates, the person should make a complain to the State Judicial Service Commission.\u201d\n\nBarrister Mba Ukweni, SAN (file copy).\n\nOn the fact that Mr. Loveday had filed a motion against the Registrar that never saw daylight, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mba maintained, \u201cthat would be a gross misconduct on the part of the Magistrate, if it is so he should take the appropriate procedure for the disciplining of the Magistrate.\n\n\u201cI am not preview to the details of what is there, I cannot also start making firm statement if there is a petition. If there is a petition, it is to allow the petition go through the its due process, the whole hawk of the complain made, it would be too bad for a Magistrate to do so.\u201d He said.\n\nHe went further to posit that, as regard him being a Magistrate and a Registrar in a Magistrate\u2019s Court, \u201ctransfer of service is normal, but what should worry us is not transfer of service but the conduct \u2026 There were no Court provided, it is not the fault of the Magistrate that no Court, they are staff of the judiciary, it is where you send them to, that is where they will work.\u201d\n\nJudiciary Headquarters, NBA Not Aware\n\nThe Chief Registrar, Judiciary Headquarters Calabar, Edem Okokon when contacted denied knowledge of abuse of office in Ikom Magistracy.\n\nHe told CrossRiverWatch that: \u201cI may not have a clear idea on it, maybe after the opening of the legal year I will have to do some investigation and get back to you.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ntem Ikpi, Chairman NBA Ikom Zone (Yakurr, Obubra, Etung, Ikom, Boki and Abi) told this reporter that: \u201cWe had an emergency meeting yesterday, it was expected at that meeting if there is anything like that its for us to be informed. I\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nNkonang Neji, NBA Chairman, Ikom branch confirmed to CrossRiverWatch that Bassey arrived at Ikom as a Registrar and was converted to Magistrate while serving in Ikom.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHe has been there as a Magistrate and a Registrar, but not sitting as a Court. There are issues that conflict, a warrant is signed by him and it conflicts with the Magistrate that is presiding. He says he has power to sign warrants which is true, as a Magistrate but if you sign a warrant, send it to the Police to investigate and charge to Court, they should charge to a court that is sitting.\u201d\n\nOn allegations of abuse of office, he said, \u201cI have not heard he has a penchant for going after people\u2019s wives. I was not copied in those petitions, I would have confronted him, nobody in all the petitions have ever copied me as Chairman of the Bar.\u201d\n\nHe complained about poor infrastructure and funding for the judiciary in Ikom and called for help.\n\nThis investigation was supported by Civic Media Lab under its Investigative Reporting Project.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has said the suspension of the operations of Twitter in the country will end only if the company meets certain conditions, such as the setting up of a local unit and payment of taxes.\n\nBuhari listed these conditions during a broadcast to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary on Friday, October 1.\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nAccording to the president, a committee constituted to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria had successfully addressed a number of key issues, including \u201cnational security and cohesion; registration of physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee, which was set up in July, is led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who revealed in August that the ban would be lifted in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will soon be lifted as we are getting close to reaching full agreement,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe have agreed on some areas, hopefully in the next few days or weeks, we will conclude.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.

It remains to be seen if the social media giant will meet the demands of Nigerian authorities, especially after choosing to base its African headquarters in Ghana \u2013 a country it describes as a \u201cchampion for democracy, supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "The Lagos Angel Network (LAN) has appointed a new Board of Governors (BoG) to oversee its affairs, effective from today October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to a LAN statement, the new board, chaired by Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, has the mandate to reposition the organisation with a focus on recruiting and educating local angel investors and championing advocacy for early-stage investing in Nigeria.\n\nOther members of the BoG are Biola Alabi, founder, Biola Alabi Media, who will sit as Deputy Chair of the BoG; Yemi Keri, co-founder, Rising Tide Africa; Olumide Soyombo, co-founder, Voltron Capital; Iyin Aboyeji, founder, Future Africa; and Gerrad Olisa-Ashar, co-founder, Diaspora Angel Network.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLAN was created to facilitate the development and emergence of an active early-stage investment community in Nigeria. Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling. Our passion, commitment, and experiences will stand us in good stead as we embark on this journey.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "The website of Nigeria\u2019s official digital currency, eNaira, went live on Monday, four days before its planned launch on October 1, as disclosed by Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nDeveloped by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the apex bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria.\n\nA welcome note on the website describes the eNaira as a \u201cCentral Bank of Nigeria-issued digital currency that provides a unique form of money denominated in Naira.\u201d\n\nThe website is a central repository where users can find comprehensive information about the official digital currency, but it offers much more than just details of the eNaira. TechCabal reviewed the website and here are at least five other things Nigerians can do on the platform.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n1. Download the eNaira application\n\nThe eNaira app (termed \u201cSpeed\u201d) can be downloaded from either the Google PlayStore, Apple App Store, or by scanning a QR code on the website. The app is expected to be available for download from October 1, 2021, and will serve as the official wallet for smartphone users.\n\n2. Manage your wallet\n\neNaira users will be able to fund and manage funds in their wallets on the website once the digital currency is officially rolled out on October 1. According to information on the platform, the wallet offers a \u201cgreat way of making purchases with retailers on-site, transferring or sending money\u201d. The e-wallet can also be linked to bank accounts and used for pay-as-you-go services.\n\n3. Join the eNaira community\n\nThe community is a social hub where, according to a note on the website, eNaira users across the globe can connect with one another, share their experiences using the digital currency, offer as well as request help.\n\nThere are four community rooms, each designed to host conversations about eNaira regulations, merchants, wallet, and registrations. Nigerians who are interested in joining the community can sign up using their email addresses.\n\n4. Stay up to date with news on CBDCs\n\nThe news hub on the website curates content relating to the eNaira and other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) across the world for users to stay updated with relevant developments on official digital currencies.\n\n\u201cCBDCs are being developed all over the world for differing national objectives. Being an eNaira user naturally transports you to the world of CBDCs and this space is your guide to that world,\u201d a note on the website reads.\n\n5. Read and share eNaira insights and experiences\n\nNigerians who choose to put their experiences with the eNaira in writing or want to share important insights can reach out to the authorities and have their feedback published on the Insights/Users Speak page of the website.\n\nThe eNaira website is loaded with very important information and instructions as well as answers to potential questions in the FAQ section. It\u2019s generally a good foundation to build on, ahead of the official launch of the digital currency on Friday.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "#TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Nigerians have been promised the lifting of the four-month-long Twitter ban. After the last promise in August of \u2018a few days\u2019 given by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, President Muhammadu Buhari, in his Independence Day speech, today mentioned that the ban would be lifted conditionally based on the fulfilment of some obligations by the social media giant.\n\nRecall that in early June 2021, the Nigerian government indefinitely suspended Twitter after the platform removed a Tweet by the president for violating its rules. An infringement on citizens\u2019 right to free speech, this move has drawn reactions from human rights advocacy groups across the country.\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), for instance, filed an appeal at the ECOWAS court in Abuja asking the court to order the president to lift the ban. However, recent developments show that the case has been adjourned for final judgement on January 20, 2022.\n\nSo far, the government claims that the global tech company is only partially cooperating and hasn\u2019t fully met its demands. To that end, it is awaiting a response on three final requests made to the social media platform, which are registration, physical presence in Nigeria, and fair taxation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all these, Twitter hasn\u2019t given any official comment on the negotiations. In the meantime, the economic impact of the ban on the country keeps piling. As of August 2021, the country had lost over $360 million to the ban.\n\nIt goes without saying that citizens have found ways to circumvent the situation using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), an act the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, considers a crime and has threatened to prosecute defaulters.\n\nNot ignoring the contention that came with this move, it is essential to explore how possible it may be for Twitter to meet these requirements.\n\nAre these demands hard to meet?\n\nOn the surface, these demands are pretty simple. After all, it appears to be what the social media company would have agreed to before establishing an office in any country. Case in point, its entrance into Africa in April 2021 and the surprising choice of Ghana.\n\nBased on Twitter\u2019s comment, the decision was based on shared values \u2014 Ghana supports free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet.\n\nTrue to this, the country is one of the African countries without any case of Internet censorship or government-influenced social media censorship. Besides, Ghana currently ranks 30th on the World Press Freedom Index compared to Nigeria\u2019s 120th and Ethiopia\u2019s 101st.\n\nOn closer inspection, these aren\u2019t traits that the Nigerian government has exhibited in the past. There have been reported cases of the government slamming fines on media houses for using user-generated content (UGC) obtained from citizens\u2019 social media accounts in their reportage and tagging verified news reports from online media platforms as \u2018fake news.\u2019\n\nAlso, there is the issue of trust. And this can\u2019t be forced; it has to be earned. This Forbes article helps express the thoughts about opening an office overseas better. One of them is clearly understanding the law of the land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it appears Twitter\u2019s delay in reaching a compromise with the Nigerian government might be more in consideration of the government\u2019s motive and possible implications on the citizens and other global tech companies.\n\nWith a physical office, any move the government isn\u2019t comfortable with may cause closure or worse.\n\nIn January 2019, the Nigerian military raided the Daily Trust office and detained some staff on the allegation that it published an article that divulged classified military information related to planned attacks against Boko Haram and thus undermined national security.\n\nStill, Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, told Techpoint Africa that the decision is up to Twitter to make. However, he believes such a move isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nShould you worry?\n\n\u201cThis is one of the government\u2019s ways of doubling down. The truth is, this is not just about Twitter; it is clearly an agenda to retain and expand control,\u201d Sesan commented when asked about what the motive behind the ban is.\n\nHe also opined that the move to categorise Over-the-Top (OTT) services as broadcasters and make them liable under the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) Act is uncalled for. This means that WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix would have to apply to the Corporation to request a licence to operate in the country.\n\nBut what is surprising, according to Sesan, is that the government didn\u2019t reveal the details of the licence. In his defence, these platforms are only intermediaries.\n\nApparently, this is not the first time this move has been made in Nigeria. The first two times \u2014 2017 and 2019 \u2014 it was the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC)\u2019s call. Major players kicked against it, although telecommunication operators supported the government in this instance.\n\nAs clearly stated in a previous article, taking these licences will set the modalities for the provision of these services in Nigeria and would allow NCC to exercise some control over OTT services which is not currently in place.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation\u2026\n\nAll over the world, the OTT services marketplace is still nascent. But that does not change the fact that there is a need for some regulation. While some nations already have regulatory oversight in place \u2014 the United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya \u2014 others are seriously considering putting relevant laws in place. And interestingly, these platforms are often categorised as broadcasters.\n\nProtests against these types of regulatory regimes often happen when the government does not have clearly defined rules to guide them in enforcing the laws or when the government has displayed strongarm tactics in similar circumstances in the past.\n\nIt is important to note that there are either two motives for regulations, to increase government control and to enforce strict censorship or to create a level playing ground for both online and offline players. Sadly, this is common in African and Asian countries.\n\nFor instance, when Netflix launched in Kenya in 2018, it was banned for two weeks by the government, after which the on-demand video streaming platform was told to get a filming license. At the moment, the country already has a digital tax in place.\n\nCurrently, not only are global companies obliged to abide by laws and taxed by the countries they are registered in, but they might also be subject to foreign laws whether they are present physically or not.\n\nIn Sesan\u2019s opinion, although the Nigerian judiciary is not entirely independent, he trusts activist judges to do their work to give sound judgement on the current state of trampling on citizens\u2019 right to information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking long and hard about an idea instead of just executing it makes me complicate things. The picture gets so big that I, sometimes, lose track of the point and shelve it. That is until moments of necessity, like writing a relevant Independence Day story. Then, I have to get it done.\n\nAs I write this piece, soothed by a squeaking industrial fan from the sitting room, I can\u2019t help but draw parallels between my ideating process and the startup cum regulator relationship in Nigeria.\n\nWith a terrible ease of doing business score from the World Bank as evidence, running a startup in Nigeria involves more than drinking water and minding your business. Dr Ola Brown, the founder of Flying Doctors Nigeria, once stated that African founders have to deal with market forces (which is their business) and evil forces such as policies and infrastructure.\n\nEach painful circular or press statement from different authorities keep showing the need for constant engagement with regulators. But this is not so simple; the deeper you go, the more complicated it gets. That much you will learn as you read on, and you should.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 14, 2021, TechCabal reported that founders, investors, and government representatives are discussing a Startup Bill for Nigeria. This move came a few months after some troubling regulations like the ban on motorcycle hailing platforms in Lagos, and on cryptocurrency transactions in the country\u2019s financial sector.\n\nBut more on this later. Please permit me to take you on a little journey. If you wish, you can skip ahead to any of the talking points you might find interesting.\n\nTable of Content\n\nYou see, the world of startups is fast-paced and exciting. But regulators who keep playing catch up do not come with a friendly tap on the shoulder. Think Chiellini\u2019s pull on Saka at the Euro 2020 final.\n\nThe Verge\u2019s story of Judge William H. Alsup, who taught himself to code to settle a case between Oracle and Google, spotlights this struggle between innovation and regulations, even in developed economies, with Judge Alsup as the outlier.\n\nDigital economy expert, Titi Akinsanmi, believes that this \u201cmove fast and let regulators catch up\u201d game has its good and bad sides. But in the absence of well-structured policies and quality engagement, the bad sides emerge more often. The solution? Startup acts.\n\nWhat does a startup act mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA startup act is a piece of legislation meant to create an enabling environment for high growth technology-enabled businesses, i.e. startups. It aims to create a framework that helps solve problems around funding, infrastructure, and uncertain policies.\n\nVery few countries globally have enacted startup acts, and it is usually adopted by smaller countries looking to foster a thriving economy.\n\nConsidering Nigeria\u2019s history of policy somersaults, an actual law that harmonises different policies and helps startups thrive seems like a no brainer. Who wouldn\u2019t love government salaries for founders and tax breaks for eight years, as found in Tunisia\u2019s Startup Act 2018?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a closer look at how countries have been approaching startup policies.\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\nHow countries across the globe develop policies for startups\n\nFrom all indications, startup acts are an innovative progression from small business acts enacted by countries in the 20th century to support Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nWhile the United States enacted a small business act as far back as 1953, policies to support high growth entrepreneurs appeared in countries like Finland, Scotland, and the Netherlands in the early 1990s.\n\nLaws that generally contain startup-friendly policies have been the norm, with notable examples in France, India, and Israel.\n\nItaly was the first country to enact a startup act in 2012, and it remains just one of three countries outside Africa to have done so. Others include Argentina (2017) and the Philippines (2019).\n\nLike the rest of the world, Africa has not had many laws targeted at startups. Ghana led the way with the Small Business Act in 1980. Sixteen years later, South Africa and Zambia followed suit. Tunisia and Senegal enacted startup acts in 2018 and 2019, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of small business laws in Africa. Source: Investment Climate Reform Facility\n\nBesides clearly defining what a startup is, Tunisia\u2019s Act provides several incentives such as an eight-year tax break, salaries for founders in the first year of running the startup, one year of leave for employees looking to start a business, and exemptions from capital gains tax for investors.\n\nNote: Tunisia labels a business a startup if:\n\nThe company has not existed for eight years or more,\n\nThe number of its employees is not more than 100,\n\nMore than two-thirds of its shareholders be founders, angel or hedge fund investors,\n\nHave an innovative business model, preferably technologically based, and\n\nIts activities significantly contribute to economic growth.\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\nThe impact of startup acts in African countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTunisia and Senegal have seen their stock rise with the media and researchers since the enactment of their startup acts. The Act is still taking shape in Senegal, so I zoomed in on Tunisia.\n\nIn 2021, the Tunisian government revealed that 500 businesses (PDF in French) have received the \u201cstartup label\u201d and are entitled to incentives. Marketplace (online retail) and business and software services startups dominate the list, followed by edtech, healthtech, creative industries, and fintech.\n\nSide Note: The report was filed by Smart Tunisia, a management company responsible for implementing the National Startup Tunisia Initiative, including the country\u2019s Startup Act.\n\nInterestingly, the report states the law has boosted revenues and funding activities (PDF in French), with more foreign startups setting up in Tunisia.\n\nThe startups cumulatively generated a $23 million turnover in 2019, and those that earned revenue in 2018 and 2019 saw an 80% increase in revenue. Half of the startups witnessed revenue decline in 2020, but the other half could generate $25 million in revenue.\n\nIn 2019, the Tunisian government reported that these, primarily early-stage, startups raised $21.8 million. In 2020, the pandemic halted several funding activities, but the startups still raised $23.2 million.\n\nWhile this number might seem small compared to what\u2019s being raised by the big four \u2014 Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa \u2014 it is a marked improvement from previous years as the total funding Tunisian startups raised before 2019 was $18.7 million.\n\nSource: Smart Tunisia, Techpoint Africa\n\nIt is important to note that angel and venture capital investments form a small part of Tunisian funding activities. In 2019, it was just 11% but increased to 36% in 2020.\n\nTwo years on, it is still baby steps for the Tunisian space, and it seems there\u2019s still some work to be done. However, the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute ranked it second in Africa and 40th globally for its entrepreneurial ecosystem, and 19 foreign companies have set up shop in Tunisia since the Act.\n\nAn interesting feature of Tunisia\u2019s lauded Startup Act is that it featured contributions from experienced entrepreneurs and investors in its tech ecosystem. Other countries like Rwanda, Ghana, and Cameroon are working to enact their startup acts.\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\nNigeria\u2019s startup friendly policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAso Villa Demo Day\n\nTo date, Nigeria only has one specific law that directly supports small businesses; The Small and Medium Scale Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) Act, 2003. The agency\u2019s mandate is to foster the development of MSMEs in the country. It\u2019s not clear how effective this agency has been though, as several Nigerian businesses operate away from the law\u2019s gaze.\n\nHowever, it has several laws that support the growth of startups in Nigeria. The issue so far has been lax implementation. But I\u2019ll get back to this. Let\u2019s check out what some of those laws are.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the Venture Capital Incentive Act 2004. It offers several tax incentives for venture capital firms to invest in innovative companies and to support research.\n\nSide note: If you know any Nigerian startup or VC in 2004 and that this law existed, please reach out to me.\n\nUnder Nigeria\u2019s Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020, it has become way easier to set up a VC fund with limited partnerships. You can read more about it here.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Finance Act 2020 exempts early-stage SMEs/startups with revenue of less than \u20a625 million ($60,729) a year or \u20a62 million ($5000) a month from paying tax.\n\nTimi Olagunju, Tech Lawyer and policy consultant, argues that this law does not necessarily help high growth startups.\n\n\u201cHow many startups generate less than that amount in a year?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s revenue, not profit. Maybe it helps just the very small ones that are just starting. It doesn\u2019t help many of the well-established startups we know.\u201d he adds.\n\nTo be fair, some less than a year old startups we\u2019ve featured already process numbers higher than $60,000 a year in revenue. However, kindly take note of this provision if it applies to you or to someone you know.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act (IDITRA) has the Pioneer Status Incentive, where first-year companies in critical industries are exempt from paying tax for possibly up to five years (three years initially and renewable for an additional two years).\n\nTo date, only one ICT company has been given this tax relief, and the Nigerian government said it denied Flutterwave entry earlier this year based on a late application.\n\nNigeria also has several tax relief programs, but the process for getting this is pretty tough. Like really tough.\n\n\u201cTo be candid, most of these exemptions are at the discretion of the President; they are more often than not given on a man-know-man basis,\u201d said Enyioma Madubuike, Lead Partner at Lawrathon.\n\nBesides incentives, Nigeria has ICT related laws and regulations like the Cybercrime Act and the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). Others like Intellectual Property laws to protect startup ideas, brands, and trademarks are grossly outdated.\n\nNigeria\u2019s proposed Startup Bill seeks to harmonise these existing laws and provide relevant innovation-friendly updates that would boost startup activities in the country.\n\n\u201cLet us begin to show the government the type of laws and policies we desire for our businesses to thrive, rather than content ourselves with bearing the brunt of old laws and a toxic business environment,\u2019 said Enyioma in 2018. A view which he affirms that he still maintains to date.\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\nKey details about Nigeria\u2019s proposed startup act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly six days after TechCabal\u2019s publication, the website for the Nigerian Startup Bill went live. Per Whois.com records, the website is registered to Osaretin Oswald Goubadia, the Special Assistant to the President of Nigeria on Digital Transformation.\n\nIt contains a timeline of activities that start from the production of the first draft in June 2021 to October 2021, when the bill is to be submitted to the President, who is meant to present it as an executive bill to the National Assembly. (It\u2019s October 1, already. So, anytime now people).\n\nThe website allows any visitor to contribute to the policy-making process, and it places calls for volunteers in the communications, research and drafting, and stakeholder engagement teams\n\nBorrowing a leaf from Tunisia, the proposed Bill is ecosystem-led, and it features prominent startup founders, CEOs, and policy experts in the Nigerian tech space.\n\nInterestingly, the website features community stories across the country. From August 2021, the organisers began to hold town hall meetings in different geopolitical zones in Nigeria.\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\nVery important observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Startup Bill features a 16-person Presidential Advisory Strategic Group with members of the government, industry giants and policy experts. Are you wondering what I\u2019m wondering?\n\nThis takes me back to Monday, June 11, 2018, when Nigeria\u2019s Vice President Yemi Osibanjo inaugurated a 50-man advisory committee on technology and creativity, shortly after his famous visit to Silicon Valley.\n\nIt featured, you guessed it, heads of government agencies, industry giants, and policy experts. However, it is worth noting that four members from the 2018 committee are in the current advisory group. They include:\n\nKola Aina Founder / Ventures Platform\n\nIyin Aboyeji Founder / Future Africa\n\nMohammed I. Jega Founder / Startup Arewa\n\nSanusi Ismaila Founder / CoLab\n\nTo date, we are still asking; what happened to the Presidential Advisory Committee of 2018? Okay, let\u2019s move on for now.\n\nThe startup bill also features support from Nigeria\u2019s major government regulators and agencies. They include:\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Communications and the Digital Economy,\n\nThe National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA),\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), and\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n\nThree things stick out for me, like a sore thumb in this lineup. One is the glaring absence of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) from the list. While these bodies may be engaging the apex financial regulator behind the scenes, history does not look favourably on this.\n\nFor context, look no further than the CBN\u2019s recent ban on cryptocurrency transactions, just five months after the SEC recognised crypto and declared its intention to regulate the space.\n\nWant more context? Then consider the apex bank\u2019s decision to freeze accounts belonging to Chaka, Bamboo, and Risevest, just months after SEC announced a new licence category for digital sub-brokers. One that Chaka acquired to great plaudits. Need I say more?\n\nThe second pain point for me is the website does not detail how state governments factor in. Hear me out.\n\nNigeria might be a federal state with federal laws, but implementing those laws always comes with issues at the state level. Telecom companies have long experienced this bitter reality when installing towers and fibre optic cables in different states.\n\nTwo years after implementing a new minimum wage, up to ten states are yet to implement it. So, just putting it out there.\n\nFinally, and perhaps the most glaring sore point, is NITDA, which came under intense scrutiny in August 2021 after amendments to a leaked NITDA Bill showed significant threats to startups.\n\nOur reporter, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo, dug up what probably went unnoticed; those provisions already exist, and the amendment was to give the ICT regulator enough powers to implement sanctions when needed.\n\nThere have been thought pieces on how the Nigeria Startup Bill will harmonise existing laws. But there\u2019s a significant question to be asked. How much of Nigeria\u2019s fragmented regulatory structure can be harmonised with one Act?\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\nWhat some experts think about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people I spoke to while researching this story seem to think \u2014 with a healthy dose of scepticism \u2014 that the proposed startup act looks to be a step in the right direction.\n\nFemi Aiki, CEO of Foodlocker, insists that this is the next necessary policy step.\n\n\u201cGiven the level of unemployment, poverty and insecurity in the country and the general unease of doing business, we have to create a means of facilitating job growth and prosperity through investment. Without GDP growth, there will be no jobs.\u201d\n\nFor him, GDP = Government spending + consumer spending + private investment + (export \u2013 import).\n\nAiki also argues that startups are potent tools for job creation. He says that foreign investments can help even though poorly researched policies constantly choke them.\n\nRita Anwiri, Chief Convener of the Intellectual Property Society of Nigeria, maintains that a startup act will have its pros and cons in the Nigerian context. Besides other benefits we\u2019ve mentioned before, she believes it helps startups leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement\n\n\u201cThe need to have a proper structure with a Nigerian and African standard to be able to access the #OneSingleMarket of over a billion people cannot be overemphasised.\u201d\n\nOn the flipside, Anwiri believes this same Act could stifle innovation if it\u2019s not adequately drafted and all relevant government parties are not carried along.\n\n\u201cWith our intellectual property laws not updated, it could hinder startups from attaining their full potential. Nigerian startups have mostly chased funding and cared less about IP rights, but a Startup Act should look to change that,\u201d she adds.\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, issues like the Google vs Oracle story referenced above will start creeping up, so here\u2019s why we should start taking IP rights more seriously.\n\nMoving on, Deju Sarumi, Startup Advisory Partner at Tech Hive Advisory, admits that the country\u2019s inherent issues, or forces of evil as it were, led to a clamour for such laws that will unify existing laws that affect the tech ecosystem. Though he commends the steps, he has some reservations.\n\n\u201cWe have a plethora of enabling laws and regulations that could aid startups and big corporates alike, but these laws are largely dormant due to non-implementation. This could be another case of putting the chicken before the egg,\u201d he warns.\n\n\u201cOur legislative system is one where ideas and bills are passed but get lost in the myriad of fragmented systems, thereby leading to little or no impact on the economy or ecosystem for which they were created,\u201d he adds.\n\nEchoing this view, Olagunju points to the recent \u2018body language\u2019 from the regulators \u2014 dating back to the infamous Lagos okada ban \u2014 as good reasons to exercise caution.\n\n\u201cIf the foundation is destroyed, what can the makeup artist do? A startup act is great, but it will be a powdered approach to the core foundational issues we face if we don\u2019t have conversations with the startup community on the current laws and policies,\u201d he offers.\n\n\u201cWhen we see a commitment on our existing policies, then we can now start having conversations about the Startup Bill\u201d.\n\nWhile asking hard questions on implementation, both Olagunju and Sarumi are wary of using the Startup Act for vanity metrics.\n\n\u201cThese questions are necessary so as to avoid painting a shiny picture to gain index ratings and accolades while the main issue (growth of the ecosystem) remains unresolved,\u201d says Sarumi.\n\n\u201cThey will just use us to score political goals. They will say they\u2019re the ones that gave us a Startup Act when campaigning for elections, while nothing is being implemented,\u201d Olagunju warns.\n\nAs Victor Ekwealor, former Managing Editor, TechCabal advised in 2020, \u201cRegardless, it is important to note that a startup act is basically a mould for proper regularisation, and not a panacea for all the startup ails on the continent; it\u2019s just a start.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the next necessary step, but I do not trust the guys ruling Nigeria today.\u201d Aiki states. He, however, believes that building transparent measures for the process will prove effective.\n\nPiggybacking on Femi Aiki\u2019s assertion and the measures put in place so far, an ecosystem startup bill looks like a final trump card for the Nigerian startup ecosystem, and it has to work. It simply cannot afford to fail.\n\nSo what do you think, dear reader? Is the matter that complicated, or am I overthinking it? Most importantly, is this the next step for Nigerian tech, or do we enforce what we already have?\n\nThanks to those who stayed to the end and to those who skipped through the content.\n\nHappy Independence Day!\n\nBack to Table of Content \u2191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

A leader that can deliver is what the country needs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInstitutions have failed. National Assemblies are not doing their jobs as required; that is the problem,\u201d Sanusi stated.\n\nSanusi said that progressive countries like the United States of America do not worry about where the president comes from. All they ask for is the track record of the competency of the candidate presented.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Who wants to be Nigeria\u2019s next president?\n\nHe wondered why Nigerians were locked in debates over where the next president should come from, instead of demanding the character.\n\n\u201cObasanjo from the South-west was a president for 8years, did the northerners die?\u201d he asked.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim from the north of Africa\u2019s most populous nation, is due to step down after elections in early 2023.

However, he sounded a warning that if the country should continue to rely on numbers of votes to determine its president, then Nigeria will end up having unqualified leaders.\n\nThe one-time CBN governor also said that the failure of the country in the last 61 years can be traced to the fact that the institutions set for the smooth running of the country\u2019s affairs have failed in their responsibilities.

          "title": "How flawed elections cripple democracy in Nigeria since independence",
          "text": "Flawed elections overseen by 12 electoral chiefs remain a stubborn stain on the democratic history of Nigeria since Independence in 1960, denying the country quality leadership it desperately needs, political experts have said.\n\nMoshood Salvador, a former member of the House of Representatives and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Martins Onovo, a US-trained petroleum engineer, and former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP), and Kunle Okunade, political scientist and analyst, are on the same page in this belief.\n\nAccording to them, Nigeria has not made progress in the enthronement of the two pillars of democracy \u2013 the rule of law and the integrity of the ballot.\n\nMoshood, Onovo and Okunade, who spoke in separate interviews with BusinessDay, note that faulty electoral process has helped to perpetuate wrong persons in power, and this has become an impediment to achieving democratic gains.\n\nSalvador says the fraudulent electoral process in Nigeria\u2019s electoral history had continued over the decades because it was benefiting some people, adding that electronic transmission of results was the way forward.\n\nRead Also: EFCC says it intervened in Nigeria\u2019s elections to tackle vote-buying\n\n\u201cThe controversy that has trailed elections in Nigeria even from the First Republic is man-made, and is for selfish interest; go and check history, and I don\u2019t think it will stop soon,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut it is a matter of choice. Kaduna State is now showing them the way out with the successful use of e-transmission of results in its LG elections. The National Assembly is kicking against it because they are benefiting from the faulty system of ballot box snatching and all the manipulations,\u201d Salvador further notes.\n\nMartin Onovo laments the failure of the nation\u2019s electoral process to positively affect its democracy.\n\nAccording to Onovo, \u201cThe rule of law is corrupted; the integrity of the ballot is corrupted because votes have never counted in Nigeria since independence. Nigeria was founded on election rigging. We have the confession of our colonial officer, Harold Smith, who said the colonial authorities rigged the first election. So, Nigeria was founded on rigging.\u201d\n\nKunle Okunade blames politicians for their refusal to play politics by the rules, adding that lack of punitive measures for political offenders had also contributed to the trend.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s electoral process is still at the infancy stage because of the abnormalities displayed by the electoral actors. Smooth conduct of elections in any democratic state can only be achieved if all stakeholders, including the electorate, abide by the rules and regulations guiding the process of elections.\n\n\u201cThe poor state of the economy has strongly affected the electoral process such that members of the political elite are currently exploiting it to their advantage by engaging in a new sharp electoral malpractice called \u2018vote buying.\u2019 This new twist would continue to desecrate the electoral temple, which will not do the country any good.\n\n\u201cAs it is, the electoral process in this system still lacks transparency, fairness, and credibility. Once an electoral process lacks these three ingredients, it remains a charade in its totality,\u201d Okunade states further.\n\nNigeria has had 12 chairmen of electoral commissions since 1960, but the quality of the elections continues to grow worse. Several attempts at electoral reform have also not yielded the desired result.\n\nIn the First Republic, serious dispute among the political parties and political leaders about the conduct and result of the federal elections of December 30, 1964, which were described as neither free nor fair, and serious malpractices were reported from many parts of the country, contributing to the reasons for the bloody 1966-1970 civil war.\n\nSimilar disagreement resurfaced in the Second Republic, 1979-1983. The victory of Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) for a second term was disputed by most of the major parties, and serious questions were raised on the astronomical increase in the voters\u2019 register occurring in NPN strongholds by the Victor Ovie-Whiskey-led Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO).\n\nAlthough Ovie-Whiskey was openly condemned across the country, the NPN hailed the election, praising him for his competence.\n\nElection dispute again resurfaced in the aborted Third Republic, where there was an attempt at democratic transition between 1985 and 1993, under the regime of Ibrahim Babangida, who was ill-fated with the annulment of June 12, 1993, presidential election.\n\nThe election conducted by the Humphrey Nwosu-led Commission, was won by the late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola (MKO). It was considered the freest and fairest in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nSince the birth of the Fourth Republic in 1999, election results have continued to be controversial, while violence and other electoral malpractices have also been on the increase.\n\nThe 2007 general election, conducted by Maurice Iwu, was adjudged to be one of the worst in the history of Nigeria. The late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, who was elected in that election, confessed that the election that brought him to power was flawed.\n\nExperts say the current process does not satisfy the quest for democratic governance in the country.\n\nIn its final report on the conduct of the 2019 general election in Nigeria, the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) concluded that there was a need for serious electoral reforms due to the systemic failings and low level of voter participation recorded during the polls.\n\nThe mission observed that the 2019 general election was marked by severe operational and transparency deficiencies, including electoral security problems, low turnout and abuse of incumbency power.\n\nOn the implication of incremental deterioration of the electoral process\u2014voter apathy and rising loss of confidence in the judicial process that deliver jaundiced justice that throw up pseudo-leaders who only contribute to the underdevelopment of the country, Onovo says it has destroyed the very fabrics of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe increasing level of apathy being exhibited by voters shows that things are only getting worse. Over the years, elections have been flagrantly rigged and wrong people, who do not have anything to offer to Nigeria, are put in government. It is garbage in; garbage out; that has been our leadership story,\u201d he further states.\n\n\u201cNigerians believe it is a sheer waste of time to go vote when their votes will not count. This is not about the All Progressives Congress (APC); it was the same story during the dispensation of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP). It would still be the same if any other party is in power today. The problem is systemic. The earlier it is permanently addressed, the better for Nigeria,\u201d Onovo adds.\n\nAmid the current electoral crisis, part of the reforms canvassed by stakeholders was that the INEC should transmit election results electronically to check manipulation and fraud.\n\nBut the suggestion did not get a favourable response from the National Assembly in the recent amendment of the 2010 Electoral Act.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives passed Clause 52, allowing INEC the discretion to decide whether to transmit election results electronically, the Senate said the clause was amended to allow the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to decide on where and when electronic voting and electronic transmission of results should take place.\n\nWith the country inching toward another general election, stakeholders have expressed fear that the decision of the federal legislature may have erased any hope of a free and fair election in 2023.\n\nSalvador says: \u201cThis sort of voting for electronic transmission of results should have been unanimous, but look at what happened. The issue would have been a thing of the past if that amendment was done. It is because these people, the incumbent, know they have failed and people are not happy with them.\u201d",
          "summary": "Martin Onovo laments the failure of the nation\u2019s electoral process to positively affect its democracy.\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s electoral process is still at the infancy stage because of the abnormalities displayed by the electoral actors.\n\u201cAs it is, the electoral process in this system still lacks transparency, fairness, and credibility.\nOnce an electoral process lacks these three ingredients, it remains a charade in its totality,\u201d Okunade states further.\nThe earlier it is permanently addressed, the better for Nigeria,\u201d Onovo adds.",

          "title": "Nigeria stagnant as world races towards knowledge-based economy",
          "text": "As Nigeria marks its 61st independence anniversary, 23.2 million of its people are unemployed of which 41 percent are youths; another 13 million children are out of school leaving many with little to cheer.\n\nDisillusioned, many of Nigeria\u2019s young people are fleeing the country in search of a better future elsewhere, with current trends on social media being a loud celebration of their departure outside the country\u2019s borders.\n\nA broken educational system and dearth of opportunities abound in a global race for the skills that would make them competitive in a knowledge-based economy.\n\nExperts say a knowledge-based economy relies more on intellectual capabilities than natural resources to enhance economic growth and development.\n\nSome of the jobs of the future are in software engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, payment solutions, creative designs and digital applications, among others, form the foundation of a knowledge-based economy.\n\nIn the current digital age, knowledge is a key factor in economic growth, creation of wealth, globalisation, job creation and entrepreneurship development.\n\nRead Also: Fixing Nigeria\u2019s economy from a policy angle\n\n\u201cBut Nigeria is not ready for the future of jobs and it is not due to intellectual capacity. The issue is that the government and structure that creates opportunities for these people are not there,\u201d Jennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered recruitment and training consultancy, says.\n\nShe also notes that the government is not bringing in enough incentives to encourage Nigerians to stay, saying, \u201cPeople are using the country as a stepping stone to gather what they can in terms of education and taking it abroad, thereby fuelling the economy of other countries.\u201d\n\nAccording to the US government census data, the Nigerian diaspora is overall the best-educated and its members are more than twice as likely to have secured an advanced degree.\n\nSimilarly, Muhammad Sanusi, the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, noted at the closing ceremony of the Kaduna Investment Summit held last week that the whole idea of a knowledge-based economy was to train people \u2013 value creators -and not just consumers.\n\n\u201cDigitisation provides an opportunity to level the playing ground, if we are deliberate and shift from consumption to value creation. But part of the problem that we have is that even if we have the solution at hand, we don\u2019t take it,\u201d Sanusi said.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, knowledge economies are defined by four pillars, which are: institutional structures that provide incentives for entrepreneurship and the use of knowledge, skilled labour availability and good education systems, ICT infrastructure and access, and a vibrant innovation landscape that includes academia, the private sector and civil society.\n\nSome countries, especially oil producing ones, have identified these pillars and by leveraging them, have witnessed high per capita incomes, low unemployment rates and strong economic growth.\n\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII), which ranks world economies according to their innovation capabilities, shows these countries in the 132 countries surveyed, United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks 33rd, Saudi Arabia ranked 66th, and Qatar ranked 68th. These countries have also reported high GDP per capita with $32,686, $20,742 and $55,517, respectively, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nFor example, Qatar\u2019s investment in education is commensurate with its National Vision 2030, which advocates finding an optimum balance between the current oil-based economy and a knowledge economy characterised by innovation and entrepreneurship, excellence in education and the efficient delivery of public services.\n\nThe government has also begun offering investors tax breaks and other incentives to support entrepreneurship and promote Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nQatar\u2019s Science and Technology Park focuses on the four priority areas identified by the Qatar National Research Strategy of 2012, namely energy, environment, health sciences and information and communication technologies (ICTs).\n\nTo achieve the UAE vision of developing a diverse and flexible knowledge-based economy, it developed its Vision 2021 plan in 2010. The plan is linked to a national strategic plan for higher education and scientific research to set up programmes for tackling problems facing the higher education sector.\n\nThe science and technology university education programme is updated to match global standards as well as strengthen scientific expertise in line with private sector requirements and national development needs.\n\nSaudi Arabia is advancing towards a diversified knowledge-driven economy. The country is focused on technology transfer in order to compensate for paucity of various indigenous technological capacities.\n\nIn 2016, the country launched Vision 2030, a strategic framework to reduce its dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation and tourism.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has made very little progress in innovation towards its transition to a knowledge-based economy. The country ranks 118th out of 132 countries and its per capita GDP is $2,209.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government has not really seen the importance of having a knowledge-based economy. In fact, I don\u2019t see us transiting to that type of economy in the next decade,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says.\n\nNigeria\u2019s performance in human capital development has not been impressive. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the country dropped three positions, ranking 161 in 2019 from 158 in 2018 among 189 countries in Human Development.\n\nAlso, over the past few years, budgetary allocation to education has not been more than 7 percent of its total budget. It is no wonder that the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said the country had the highest out of school children in the world.\n\n\u201cThe completion rate between entry into primary one and completing university is 8 percent. Out of every 100 children who go into primary one, only eight end up coming out of the university. And out of these, 9 percent will get a job. So, this is the reality,\u201d Sanusi emphasised.\n\nA report by International Finance Corporation (IFC) highlights the existence of a skills gap, out-dated curriculum in engineering programmes and lack of opportunities for students to apply skills learned in the classroom in most African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nAyodele Akinwunmi, senior relationship manager, Corporate Banking Group, FSDH Merchant Bank, says innovation cannot happen without investment in human capital.\n\n\u201cOnce you don\u2019t develop your human capacity and you have your natural resources, you will not be able to utilise them effectively to turn them to what is productive. But if you develop human capacity, it will bring income generation, tax for the government and then employment generation,\u201d Akinwunmi states.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of Minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHarcourt Port \u2013 Rivers State governor, Nyeson Ezenwo Wike says Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) elected governors are working in unison to ensure that the party wins the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe stated that contrary to the expectation of those who do not wish the party well, all the PDP governors are working hard to ensure the party regains the realm of power in 2023.\n\nThe governor gave this assurance at a reception for chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, including its former spokesperson, Mr. Ogbonna Nwuke; all the 23 local government chairmen of African Action Congress (AAC) who dumped their parties to join the PDP at the Isaac Boro Park, Port Harcourt on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting hard and God willing, PDP will takeover Nigeria in 2023. It is not a question of wishful thinking. It is a question of being committed and we are going to do it. All the governors of (PDP) have agreed, we will do it. PDP will never be divided. All the people who are thinking that PDP will be divided, they have all failed. All those who were trying to sabotage Rivers state, they have all been knocked out.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that he was not surprised that Nwuke and others have decided to dump the APC. According to him, those who decamped have merely come to the realisation that cannot continue to be misguided and listen to illusive stories, particularly of the APC.\n\nHe said the people of Rivers state have seen that the PDP means well for them, hence, they have decided to put their fate in the hands of Almighty God first, and then the PDP.\n\nThe governor stated that PDP in the State has never been owned by an individual as is the case with the APC. He assured those who just decamped to the party and others who will join them in the future, that when decision to pick his successor will be made, they will not be excluded.\n\n\u201cEverybody must participate, and then we will take decision. It can be those who are coming now, you never can tell. Nobody can say because you came in yesterday, or because you came in today, you are not entitled. Everybody is entitled as far as PDP is concern.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike reiterated that Nigerians have since realised that APC led government has failed in all sectors. And he challenged the remnants of the APC to mention what Federal government has done for Rivers state in the last six years.\n\nThe governor expressed optimism that the sterling performance of his administration, particularly as it concerns infrastructural and human capacity development, has continued to endear the party to voters in the State.\n\n\u201cNo one project awarded by this administration will remain abandoned before we leave on the 29 May 2023. And then, another PDP government will come and take over from us. Let me assure you, God has already sealed it. Let nobody bother himself, PDP will take over Rivers State again because it is very obvious. Why will PDP take over? We will take over because we have made promises to you and we have fulfilled the promises.\u201d\n\nThe governor further charged all the PDP local government chairmen to ensure that those who just decamped to the party are not alienated.\n\nFormer Rivers State APC spokesperson, Ogbonna Nwuke, said in the last six years they have been in the wilderness.\n\n\u201cWe were promised change, but I will say we did not find change in Etche. All politics is local and I couldn\u2019t stand by, do the fighting and watch those who superintended over the affairs of the APC act in a manner that appeared callous. Accordingly, we have found our way out of wilderness. We have stumbled into light and we have found development partner and that development partner is the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the good road that you built. First, you gave us the Igwuruta-Chokocho dual carriage road. Then you gave us the Udofor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road. And the other day you returned and then you gave us the announcement of the Chokocho-Igbodo Road. Your Excellency, there is jubilation in Etche. I am jubilant myself.\n\n\u201cI am excited. And to tell you the candid truth, there could have been no better news. Today your Excellency, I have come back home . Honestly, there can be nothing better than home. Etche has 205 oil wells, Etche has over 80 percent of gas deposit south of River Niger and Your Excellency, you have already identified our need. the Etche need is access.\u201d\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives, Emma Deeyah, who also dumped the APC, said they were endeared to Governor Wike because of his bold and courageous leadership in the State.\n\nChairman of the PDP in Rivers State, Ambassador Desmond Akawor said all the former APC chieftains and AAC members that decamped to the PDP, were lured to join opposition by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.\n\nHe remarked that having realised that the APC has nothing to offer the people of the State and Nigerians, they decided to dump the party and all that it represents to join the PDP.\n\nSome members of the APC that decamped to the PDP are former member of House of Representatives, Daemi Akpanah; former member of House of Assembly, Ibiso Nwuche; former Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly, Stephen Ezekwem; former Commissioner of Works, Levy Braide; former member of House of Assembly, Emmanuel Okata; former chairman, Rivers State Civil Service Commission, Ngo Martins-Yellowe; Goodlife Nmekini, former Special Adviser to Governor Chibuike Amaechi; Dr. Barinedum Nwibere, former Director General, Cole/Giadom campaign organisation among others.\n\n...",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: Since independence, Nigeria\u2019s per capita income highest under Jonathan, Yar\u2019Adua",
          "text": "The value of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product is the reason it is often referred to as the largest economy in Africa, and this is often the selling point for successive administrations in the country.\n\nSo this explains why every Nigerian government is quick to flaunt a rise in GDP, as did President Muhammadu Buhari in the televised 61st independence broadcast on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021,\u201d the Nigerian leader said.\n\nAn earlier analysis of data from the World Bank by this newspaper showed that Mr Buhari, in his first coming as a military leader, owns the record of the administration with the highest GDP growth since independence. His democratic tenure, however, lags behind some military juntas and civilian administrations.\n\nHowever, because GDP growth does not mean improved standard of living and quality of life of a population, GDP per capita becomes an alternative measure to estimate the average amount in the pocket of each person in a country.\n\nIt is measured by dividing the country\u2019s GDP by its population.\n\nHow does each administration since independence rank in terms of GDP performance?\n\nPer capita income since independence\n\nAt $2,792, Nigeria made the highest average per capita income under Goodluck Jonathan. Under his predecessor, Musa Yar\u2019Adua, it was $2,138 per head, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s tenure as of 2020 had averaged $2,097. This is followed by Mr Shagari whose administration averaged $1,530, followed by Mr Obasanjo\u2019s eight-year democratic rule with $1,064.\n\nThe lowest regime averages were recorded under Mr Abacha with $455; Mr Shonekan, $321; Mr Gowon, $223; Mr Aguiyi-Ironsi, $124; and Tafawa Balewa, $105 in the First Republic.\n\nThe years between 2002 and 2020 returned the highest per capita income, with 2012 to 2014 having the highest respective returns. 1980 to 1985, under Messrs Shagari and Buhari, were the only years outside of the 21st century ranked in the top 25.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the immediate years after independence had the lowest per capita record.\n\nNigeria lags behind\n\nSome countries that were economic peers of Nigeria have been able to ramp up their per capita income over the years, but Nigeria has not.\n\nFor instance, in 1990 Nigeria\u2019s per capita income was around $568, about two times China\u2019s $348. By 2020, Nigeria\u2019s figure grew to $2,097, only about four times what it was three decades ago. Within the same period, China\u2019s per capita income had topped $10,484 (thirty times more).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt means the Chinese, who once had in their pockets only about half of what Nigerians had 30 years ago, now have about five times more money than their Nigerian counterparts.\n\nBut economists discourage comparing a country\u2019s per capita income with another\u2019s because many variables determine the figure.\n\nPer capita income is not without its own limitations. Like GDP growth, it does not always reflect the accurate standard of living of the people.\n\nOne of its limitations is that its calculation does not factor in inflation rate, a key determinant of consumer purchasing power.\n\nAnother is that, because the entire population is considered, a country with a huge population of children, old, sick and other age groups not actively engaged in economic activities, would have a skewed figure.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nYoruba self determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua, has berated Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, over his independence anniversary speech, noting that the president has once again, shown that he is for the North and not the rest of Nigeria.\n\nThe group in a statement, on Friday by Maxwell Adeleye, its Communications Secretary, on behalf of its leader, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, asked the president to tell Nigerians those sponsoring Boko Haram terrorists and herdsmen, while wondering why he would be talking about those sponsoring \u201clegitimate\u201d quest for Yoruba nation while ignoring those funding the murderous activities of the terror groups.\n\nRecall that Buhari had in his speech, said that his government had conducted investigations revealing the financiers of agitators in the Southeast and Southwest.\n\nThe president had said, \u201cThe recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\u201d\n\nHowever, reacting to the assertion, Ilana Omo Oodua said the president has only further exposed himself as the President of the North, and not that of Nigerians, noting that he has \u201csucceeded in emboldening us more to fight on in the agitation for Self-Determination for the Yoruba people.\u201d\n\nThe group said it is \u201ca total nonsense that Buhari is bothered about a Sunday Igboho who is engaged in a lawful agitation, endorsed and confirmed now by a court of competent jurisdiction, United Nations and African Union Declarations on Peoples and Human Rights while he (Buhari) looked away on the murderous activities of the Fulani Herdsmen Terrorists and Miyyetii Allah in the South and Middle-Belt Territories.\n\n\u201cMr. President said an unknown Sitting Member of the Nigerian National Assembly is involved in the funding of Sunday Igboho. That\u2019s an absolute mendacity. The Yoruba people from villages to villages to the Diaspora are contributing their hard-earned resources to oil and sustain the agitation.\n\n\u201cOur appeal to Buhari is to, as a matter of urgency, name the invincible national assembly member so that the Yoruba People can celebrate him because he is supporting a NOBLE STRUGGLE.\n\n\u201cIf indeed such a National Assembly member exists unknown to us in Ilana Omo Oodua, we say very expressly that he is a hero that has chosen to stand by a legitimate, legal and constitutional agitation. Therefore, Buhari is merely grandstanding.\n\n\u201cAs Buhari name the unknown National Assembly Member, Our utmost appeal to him is to help Nigerians in naming those funding murderous Fulani Herdsmen and Boko Haram Terrorists oppressing, maiming, killing and raping his people in the North and the people of the South and Middle-Belt with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe entire speech of Buhari symbolises hopelessness and chaos. It was a declaration of war against the peace-loving people of Yoruba Land. Our message to him is that we shall not be intimidated. We shall remain loyal and committed to our struggle for an Independent Yoruba Nation.\n\n\u201cWe shall be undaunted. No Oppressor has ever triumphed over the people. In this struggle, we shall continue to be legitimate and peaceful. It is amandla awetu, nothing shall discourage us\u201d\n\nYoruba Nation.\u201d",

The North West, North Central and almost the entire country is almost a NO-GO AREA due to widespread insecurity. Terrorist groups control over 10 local government areas in the president\u2019s home state of Katsina and collect taxes from residents openly and unchallenged.\n\n\u201cSo many people who were killed by terrorists in Southern Kaduna were buried yesterday. Dora Akunyili\u2019s husband was gunned down recently in the South-East yet the president praises the military for failure.\n\n\u201cThe president also said he has discovered sponsors of IPOB and Oduduwa agitators but failed to talk about sponsors of Boko Haram that Dubai revealed recently because they are from his zone.\n\n\u201cThe president apparently needs prayers for saying his administration is the best since 1999 and that Nigerians have never had it so good. It is unthinkable that the president of a nation should openly peddle so much falsehood as Buhari has just done.\n\n\u201cFor context, cooking gas is N7,200 from N3,000 in 2015. $1 is N575 from N200 in 2015. The list goes on and on of the inflation records of the current administration. Nigeria has fallen completely to terrorist groups.

          "text": "The Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described the Independence Day address by President Muhammadu Buhari to Nigerians on October 1, as the worst in the history of the country.\n\nIt wondered why Buhari made no mention of the killer herdsmen, bandits and insurgents who were destroying farms and hunting farmers away from their farmlands across the country.\n\nPANDEF, in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP on Friday in Port Harcourt by its spokesman, Ken Robinson, stated that the President\u2019s Independence Day speech reverberated the bigotry and nepotism of the present administration.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cThis year\u2019s Independence Day speech by President Muhammadu Buhari can easily be deemed the worst independence day speech in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThe speech was indifferent to the mood of the country; the growing disaffections, dissensions and disillusions, arising from the actions and inactions of the government. Rather, it\u2019s full of hallucinations and wishful thinking, perhaps, based on what might be pleasing to the President, and not the citizens.\n\n\u201cThere is something wrong with the president\u2019s speechwriters and handlers. They offend citizens\u2019 sensibilities in their ridiculous, tenuous justification of the colossal failure of the administration.\n\n\u201cThey are either making excuses or playing the blame game; it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. How can they say it is hoarding by \u201cmiddlemen\u201d that is responsible for the current food crisis in the country?\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, no mention was made of the killer herdsmen, bandits and insurgents who are destroying farms and hunting farmers away from their farmlands, across the country. Of course, they are untouchables! The assertion that the government is taking the fight against insecurity to the enemy and winning, is also odd. How?\n\n\u201cA few days ago, gunmen, reportedly, again, invaded Sarkin Pawa, headquarters of Munyan local government area of Niger state, killing no fewer than thirty people. Bandits also, allegedly, overran a joint military base in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto State, killing some security personnel, last week.\n\n\u201cAnd, last Sunday, suspected Boko Haram insurgents also reportedly attacked a community in Yobe State. The incident, which caused many of the villagers to flee, came a month after the terrorists launched a similar assault on the community. Reports of the horrendous activities of Bandits, Insurgents and Herders are upsetting and terrifying.\n\n\u201cSo what \u2018fight against insecurity\u2019 is the government winning? Is it the fight against Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu? That explains why, they, easily, can declare to have identified sponsors of Igboho and Kanu but remain silent on sponsors of the insurgents, bandits and killer herders, who are the true enemies of the country. It\u2019s a shame.\n\n\u201cThis independence day speech reverberates the bigotry and nepotism of the Buhari administration. And that\u2019s Nigeria\u2019s greatest problem today.\u201d",

          "text": "The Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described the Independence Day address by President Muhammadu Buhari to Nigerians on October 1, as the worst in the history of the country.\n\nIt wondered why Buhari made no mention of the killer herdsmen, bandits and insurgents who were destroying farms and hunting farmers away from their farmlands across the country.\n\nPANDEF, in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP on Friday in Port Harcourt by its spokesman, Ken Robinson, stated that the President\u2019s Independence Day speech reverberated the bigotry and nepotism of the present administration.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cThis year\u2019s Independence Day speech by President Muhammadu Buhari can easily be deemed the worst independence day speech in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThe speech was indifferent to the mood of the country; the growing disaffections, dissensions and disillusions, arising from the actions and inactions of the government. Rather, it\u2019s full of hallucinations and wishful thinking, perhaps, based on what might be pleasing to the President, and not the citizens.\n\n\u201cThere is something wrong with the president\u2019s speechwriters and handlers. They offend citizens\u2019 sensibilities in their ridiculous, tenuous justification of the colossal failure of the administration.\n\n\u201cThey are either making excuses or playing the blame game; it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. How can they say it is hoarding by \u201cmiddlemen\u201d that is responsible for the current food crisis in the country?\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, no mention was made of the killer herdsmen, bandits and insurgents who are destroying farms and hunting farmers away from their farmlands, across the country. Of course, they are untouchables! The assertion that the government is taking the fight against insecurity to the enemy and winning, is also odd. How?\n\n\u201cA few days ago, gunmen, reportedly, again, invaded Sarkin Pawa, headquarters of Munyan local government area of Niger state, killing no fewer than thirty people. Bandits also, allegedly, overran a joint military base in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto State, killing some security personnel, last week.\n\n\u201cAnd, last Sunday, suspected Boko Haram insurgents also reportedly attacked a community in Yobe State. The incident, which caused many of the villagers to flee, came a month after the terrorists launched a similar assault on the community. Reports of the horrendous activities of Bandits, Insurgents and Herders are upsetting and terrifying.\n\n\u201cSo what \u2018fight against insecurity\u2019 is the government winning? Is it the fight against Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu? That explains why, they, easily, can declare to have identified sponsors of Igboho and Kanu but remain silent on sponsors of the insurgents, bandits and killer herders, who are the true enemies of the country. It\u2019s a shame.\n\n\u201cThis independence day speech reverberates the bigotry and nepotism of the Buhari administration. And that\u2019s Nigeria\u2019s greatest problem today.\u201d",

          "title": "Fintech 5.0: Evaluating how FirstBank strengthens collaboration",
          "text": "By KEN EMORDI\n\n\u2026To drive financial inclusion\n\nIt was Sir Isaac Newton, in his letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, who wrote the now-famous quote: \u201cIf I have seen further (than others), it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d\n\nThe shoulders of giants Sir Newton referred to has to do with leverage provided by the discoveries and experiences of people who have gone before or walked that same path earlier, that pave the way for and enable other people and a new generation to take things to a totally new dimension.\n\nThe truth is, giants whose shoulders provide such leverage to the next generation can be found in various fields and various nations. In Nigeria, for example, such giants exist in various fields and they are known and recognised.\n\nTake the fintech (financial technology) space in Nigeria, where one bank is known to have stood as a giant with very broad shoulders, having capacities that have been built up and accumulated over 127 continuous years. Every year since 2016 (apart from 2017 when it was implementing ideas from 2016, including a Digital Innovation Lab), this well-recognised bank has provided a platform for the most robust engagement of the fintech industry in Nigeria. Tagged Fintech Summit, the annual engagement has continued to help in catalysing the fintech sector to ever-higher levels from year to year.\n\nHeld in Lagos the commercial capital of Nigeria and arguably the fintech capital of Africa, given Nigeria\u2019s status as the leading nation in the fintech space in Africa, the annual FirstBank Fintech Summit has attracted an average of a thousand participants, who are mostly fintech owners, workers and enthusiasts, yearly. Last year\u2019s Summit, Fintech Summit 4.0 with the theme\n\n\u201cHow Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence will Disrupt Fintech in Nigeria\u201d, however, drew an unprecedented number of participants \u2013 over 6,000 from across 52 different countries. It was the first virtual Summit due to the restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and it featured as keynote speaker Silicon Valley-based innovator of international repute, Chinedu Echeruo, who founded HopStop that was later sold to Apple for US$1 billion. Imagine the inspiration, dreams and aspirations young people soak up while listening to speakers with such a profile.\n\nFar from being one-directional \u2013 with all the talk flowing from only the speaker to the audience \u2013 the yearly Summit is actually a platform for multidimensional engagement involving various stakeholders in the fintech industry \u2013 operators, regulators, investors, enthusiasts, fintech journalists and writers, bankers, et cetera.\n\nIt offers an unequalled opportunity for networking among fintech and other stakeholders, leading to opportunities for collaboration within the community. For small businesses and start-ups powered by FirstBank\u2019s support, the annual Summit has been a veritable platform for showcasing them. The platform has also served for the announcement of policy initiatives coupled with pronouncements that provide clarifications to policy. This is due to invitations extended to regulators and the important role they are assigned in conversations facilitated during the Summit.\n\nThe Summit that preceded last year\u2019s, i.e., the third edition of Fintech Summit 3.0 held in 2019, featured another heavyweight in Nigeria\u2019s fintech industry, Victor Asemota, founder of Swifta Systems & Services, as keynote speaker. The theme \u201cBanking + Tech = Solving Real Problems\u201d, included panel sessions featuring experts with over two hundred combined years of experience in both the financial and technological industries.\n\nThey applied their knowledge, expertise and experience to address challenges in the technologically-driven business world, structured in terms of Solving Business Problems; Solving Regulatory, Security and Legal Problems; and Solving Lifestyle Problems. At the end of the Summit, participants must have felt that the Summit delivered on the confidence the Chief Executive Officer of FirstBank, Adesola Adeduntan, had expressed when he remarked in his welcome address, \u201cI am optimistic that every organisation represented here will be empowered to provide services with greater speed and solve real societal problems to the advantage of the Nigerian populace through the insights that will be gained from this event.\u201c\n\nFintech Summit 3.0 had built on the success of the second edition, Fintech Summit 2.0 held in 2018, which had \u201cThe Future of Banking \u2013 The Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data\u201d as a theme. Adia Sowho, the Managing Director of Mines in Nigeria, had, as the first keynote speaker, stressed the importance of collaboration between legacy banks and fintechs in the overall good of their shared financial services space. The Deputy Managing Director of FirstBank, Gbenga Shobo, had, in his welcome address, said that FirstBank was committed to finding the right balance in its approach in supporting the budding fintech industry. It is gratifying that the bank has since found that right balance and pushed ahead enthusiastically with the continual annual engagement that is its yearly Fintech Summit.\n\nFor those who like to bring up the argument that deposit money banks (DMBs) and fintech are rivals competing in the same space for the same customers and wonder why FirstBank, a leading deposit money bank, would itself be involved in efforts to catalyse the fintech industry, they need to wake up and smell the coffee. FirstBank is continuously evolving and staying on the cutting edge of technology in order to better serve its customers, who are themselves evolving and adapting to newer and more efficient and convenient technologies as they become available.\n\nAnd FirstBank is on a journey to a future where it is happy, in the spirit of the African tradition of Ubuntu, to take all fintech along with it. In the words of another famous quote, \u201cThe sky is too big for two [or many] big birds flying in it to collide.\u201d FirstBank believes there is ample room for all players \u2013 deposit money banks, fintech, et cetera \u2013 to fulfil their unique roles. Therefore, collaboration, not competition, is FirstBank\u2019s watchword. And FirstBank considers fintech partners in progress in its avowed commitment to driving financial inclusion.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s own evolution and the transition is causing some people to question its continuous classification by the Central Bank as a deposit money bank (with a preponderance of bricks-and-mortar banking operations) rather than a digital bank. And the reasons for their argument cannot be easily waved aside. In 2020, for example, over 85 per cent of the banking transactions that were required by customers of FirstBank were performed on the bank\u2019s self-service channels.\n\nThat means customers of the bank only needed the attention of the bank\u2019s staff or branches for just 15 per cent of all the banking transactions they required in 2020. There are now as many as over 16 million customers between FirstBank\u2019s digital channels of online banking (called FirstOnline), mobile banking (christened FirstMobile) and USSD banking (called *894# quick banking).\n\nBetween FirstOnline and FirstMobile, a growth of 21 per cent in the user base was experienced in 2020. Customers on both platforms conducted approximately 256 million transactions worth N15.7 trillion in the same year. FirstOnline, as of June 2021, had an impressive 597,466 customers on the service, a 17 per cent growth on the previous year and 578,292 transactions per month, averaging a value of N388 billion per month.\n\nFor FirstMobile, besides the impressive gain in numbers, it gained recognition as \u201cBest Mobile Banking App\u201d at the Global Finance Best Digital Bank Awards, for providing excellent self-service through its user-friendly app. FirstMobile had, as of June 2021, 4,596,203 users on the platform, which is a nine per cent growth on the previous year and an average of 27,730,830 transactions every month. While these numbers point to the giant statue of the bank, none of it excites FirstBank as much as Firstmonie, because of its invaluable role in driving financial inclusion at the grassroots level, one of FirstBank\u2019s overriding commitments.\n\nFirstmonie, the agent banking network of FirstBank, currently has over 130,000 agents across the country, making it the largest bank-led agent network anywhere in Africa. As the foremost financial inclusion service in the country, it has achieved over 750 million transactions worth N15 trillion (about US$30 billion) processed from inception to date.\n\nOver 295 million of those transactions with a total value of N6.65 trillion were processed in 2020 alone \u2013 the same year COVID-19 caused widespread disruptions across the globe. Firstmonie agency banking scheme has empowered agents across all Local Government Areas in the country, providing employment to thousands of people.\n\nFirstBank through the Firstmonie platform further supports the fintech industry via partnership collaborations with local and international fintechs.

They were kidnapped just behind the Nigerian Navy FOB Base in Ibaka waterways on their way to the sea for fishing expedition.\n\nA lawyer representing some of the fishermen, Ogunbiyi Oluwajuwon, who disclosed this to our correspondent in Uyo on Friday, said that the criminals attacked four separate boats and made away with their outboard engines in an operation that lasted for several hours.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnapers have demanded N2.5m ransom as condition for the victims\u2019 release.\n\nOluwajuwon said, \u201cOn Tuesday, 28th September 2021, in the morning fishermen from Ibaka going to sea for fishing were attacked by sea pirates, just behind the Nigerian Navy FOB Base in Ibaka waterways and they operated for hours.\n\n\u201cThey attacked four separate boats, stole their outboard engines and kidnapped four persons, among whom were three Ghanaians and one Nigerian who are currently in their custody.\n\n\u201cThe kidnappers are demanding N2.5m before they can be released.\u201d\n\nOluwajuwon, who lamented that attacks on fishermen by sea pirates was becoming a daily occurrence, said that some fishermen had stopped going to sea for fear of being kidnapped.\n\n\u201cLast week, more than five boats were attacked and over seven persons were kidnapped. It took the payment of N4m before they were released.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these sea pirates have crippled the Ibaka fishing community and its environs, as fishermen could not go for fishing due to the fear of being attacked.\n\n\u201cIn Ibeno last week, more than 10 outboard engines were seized by the sea pirates. The Akwa Ibom waterways are no longer safe,\u201d he added.\n\nOluwajuwon claimed that the Police Anti-Kidnapping Unit in the state was aware of the development and that the community had also written to the DSS about the situation.\n\nThe command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, when contacted for comment, said that information relating to the four persons\u2019 kidnap had not reached him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any such information yet,\u201d Macdon stated.

However, Adebanjo said that in 1953 when the North opposed the call for Independence and rather advocated \u2018Araba\u2019 (secession), Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe convinced the northern leadership headed by Ahmadu Bello, to negotiate the terms of their unity and ultimately their independence from British rule.\n\nAdebanjo said, \u201cHe (Buhari) is talking nonsense. These are the kinds of things that cause trouble.\n\n\u201cHow can the President of a multinational, multilingual and multi-ethnic society say the unity of Nigeria is non-negotiable? We negotiated the unity of Nigeria in 1954 before independence.\n\n\u201cThe 1960 Constitution was a product of negotiation that arose from the London constitutional conference.\n\n\u201cOf course, I can\u2019t blame him (Buhari). He was still in primary school at that time, so, he couldn\u2019t understand. He should go back to the records.\n\n\u201cBefore the constitutional conference, the country was being run as a unitary government and that was what caused the crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to that conference, Chief Awolowo re-educated them that you cannot run the country as a unitary system. It was at that conference that Nnamdi Azikiwe was converted to federalism and when he returned from that conference, Azikiwe, at the airport, declared that federalism was imperative. It was in the Daily Times of 1954.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said that the 1960 Constitution gave all the regions financial autonomy, such that every region was able to control its own destiny.\n\nAdebanjo, however, said that after the military coup of 1966 and Nigeria became a unitary state, things began to go downhill.\n\nHe, therefore, argued that, for Nigeria to return to the path of progress, it must embrace restructuring and this could be done by first doing away with the 1999 Constitution which he said was not based on fairness but exploitation of the South.\n\nThe Afenifere leader also lambasted Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and the All Progressives Congress leader, Bola Tinubu, for paying lip service to restructuring.\n\nAdebanjo said that it was unfortunate that Osinbajo and Tinubu, who promoted restructuring, are now pretending as if it was not included in the APC manifesto during the election campaigns in 2015.",

We cannot say because there is impunity going on, we must be involved in such.\n\n\u201cLet us work with God to give us a new direction because there will be light at the end of tunnel. Nigeria will be out of this situation someday. So lets trust God to deliver us.

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSix young Nigerians on Friday shared their thoughts on the participation of youths in politics and leadership in the country.\n\nThey include actress Kate Henshaw; political strategist Moremi Ojudu; anti-corruption activist, Hamzat Lawal; CEO, Sujimoto Properties, Sijibomi Ogundele; Sponsor, Not Too Young To Run Bill, Tony Nwulu; and Lawyer/PDP Member, Anthony Ehilebo.\n\nHere are excerpts from the thoughts they shared about youth participation in governance and politics in the country during a special session with Seun Okinbaloye, aired as part of Channels TV\u2019s Special Programme celebrating Nigeria at 61.\n\nWhere did we get it wrong?\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nTo answer this question, we have to go back to, not even 1960, 1958. From 1958 to date, Nigeria has earned over $600bn dollars in oil revenue. Between 1999 and today, Nigeria has borrowed over $25bn, a capital injection of approximately N300tn.\n\nDo we look like N300tn has passed through us? Does our infrastructure, do our health care and many other things look like N300tn has passed through us? We must make those conscious decisions and address the issues of the past so that we can have a future tomorrow. If we refuse to do that, we will continue to suffer these dividends of incompetence, and I strongly believe that the cost of leadership must not be that difficult.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nFor a lot of years, we have asked ourselves that question. Did we get it wrong with our leadership? Did we get it wrong with our followership? I think we got it wrong by just focusing on one area which is leadership.\n\nI think getting it wrong started from both parties (leaders and followers) not recognising the role they had to play in the future Nigeria they needed to see. And we\u2019ve forgotten that even at the very basic level of the country \u2013 ward level, unit level \u2013 there is leadership, there is followership and we need to identify these particular niches of our country and say we all need to take responsibilities both as leaders and followers, we all have a place where we got it wrong. Agreeing to that is the very first step to fixing whatever problems we have as a country today.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nWe got it wrong when we stopped upholding the office of the citizen, which is the highest office in the land; where we took our eyes off the ball and we let things slide, where we stopped holding people accountable including ourselves, where we stopped voting people into office who truly cared about our human resources, our human capital, and the potential of this great country. That is where we got it wrong.\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nWe got it wrong because people in power became selfish. We stopped investing in people and we thought that, without investment, Nigeria could move forward. Our biggest assets are people. We got it wrong because everyone has put themselves before Nigeria.\n\nMoremi Ojudu\n\nWe stopped investing in people. We always put ourselves first and, unfortunately, our leaders have taken that path of putting themselves before others.\n\nUnfortunately, that has really put us in a very bad light and our value system became a value system of greed and a situation where we just lack focus.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nWe need to also address inequality. I believe that if you could vote then you should also be voted for. It doesn\u2019t actually mean that at 18 you should go to the Senate or at 20 you should go to the Senate. But if you live in a community where at 20 you are the only one qualified to go to the Senate then, by all means, you should go to the Senate.\n\nI think it is a different thing from the leadership failures that we\u2019ve been having. It is not that we have a dearth of leaders, but several other people have refused to also join (politics) to see what they can do to correct those anomalies that we see in society.\n\nIs our politics \u201ctoo dirty\u201d for young people?\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nA lot of people have run away because of the term \u2018dirty politics\u2019 and that is so wrong because we need to get involved. We can\u2019t effect any change from the outside. Yes, it is dirty, but we need people to go in there are clean it up.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nPolitics is not dirty, it\u2019s our mindset.\n\nMoremi Ojudu\n\nWhen you say politics is dirty, it is a relative term. Highly relative. You have to be highly diplomatic.\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nWe are picking people who have not even run a kiosk to sit in the seat of governance. There is a need today, for us to look into those elements that have some kind of internal division and convert those people into internal cohesion.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nTo run even a primary for House of Assemblies will cost you nothing less than N15 million.\n\n\u2018Money Politics\u2019: Can young people thrive without money?\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nNo, you can\u2019t. Even with the \u2018Not Too Young To Run\u2019 law.\n\nIt\u2019s not even just about not having money, it\u2019s about the fact that the Constitution itself does not guarantee equity and justice.\n\nYoung people are thriving in everything else except politics. We might debate this till tomorrow but money is important.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nWhat we\u2019ve been doing in Nigeria is giving power to people that haven\u2019t been tested, that have no precedents, that have nothing to prove that they have achieved this and that before they got into power.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nThe system is skewed. Where is the person going to get the money from?\n\nYou need money and that\u2019s the honest truth because all the people that I went to, to consult, the first thing they asked me was, \u2018what\u2019s in your war chest?\u2019 I never understood what they meant by that.\n\nI\u2019m putting myself up to help, to serve and you\u2019re asking me what\u2019s in my war chest.\n\nI thought I needed weapons until I found out it was money. I would go to speak to different groups and the language is, \u2018you have not landed\u2019?\n\nAlternatives To \u2018Money Demands\u2019\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nWe can\u2019t continue saying money is a problem when we are in a new age and era. People have had very complex protests within the last year and have been able to fund these protests and raise money. As it is today, our generation is ready to back people who are ready to run.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people who are willing to sponsor but they have not seen willing people to invest that money in.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nI think the first thing you should ask yourself is, do you have social capital?\n\nIt is what you build within the society or the community that you intend to represent (that matters). Do they believe you? Have you been able to impact some lives, not necessarily financially? What are you known for and what is your social relevance? We\u2019ve seen politicians come out with a lot of money and still get rejected.\n\nWhat sort of leaders do we need in Nigeria?\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nWithout identifying the problem we might not have the solution. The number one solution for this nation is leadership. In electing a leader, what are the things we are looking for? The first thing you must look at is competence. The second thing you must look at is integrity\u2026 After that you look at other things; what is your love for the nation? M.K.O defeated (Bashir) Tofa right in front of his house because of social capital.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nI agree (with Ogundele). I will say character, capacity, competence and empathy. See, you must have a heart for people. It is not going to be about you anymore; it is about making your people better because in them looking better, you look better.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nWe are at the stage in our country that we need fixers to come and fix things and these people are all over. In Anambra State, I had mentioned Chris Ngige and Peter Obi, when they started out. You go to Akwa Ibom, you see what the governor is doing there. He is fixing Akwa Ibom, from what I have seen that he is doing. Many other governors are doing well. Seyi Makinde is doing well. Fashola did a lot in Lagos. These are people with track records. Until we are able to tell ourselves, \u2018look, we can no longer seat in the cosy environment of our office and expect things to go well\u2019, (things won\u2019t improve). You complain that politicians are killing the economy and you have the know-how to correct the system, why don\u2019t you join (politics)?\n\nVoter turnout\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nThe turning point could be when we have a 90% voter turnout in 2023. That could be the gamechanger both for old and young people. If we can get a 90% turnout then probably people can understand that power and legitimacy belong to the people.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nPeople need to understand that the selection process for political parties starts at the ward elections. If you are not a member of a political party, how can you present yourself (as a candidate)?\n\nCan the young people step up?\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nOpportunity is not given. Power is not given, it is taken. You must have to leave the comfort of your bedroom to go and get involved (in politics). You must be intentional. You must be ready and tell yourself, \u2018I am ready to be a part of the change-makers in the society\u2019. Until we get to that point where it is very fashionable to have your voter\u2019s card and without your voter\u2019s card, I see you as a problem in society. If you don\u2019t have a voter\u2019s card, you are the reason why the hospitals are not well equipped, you are the reason why the roads are not fixed.\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nYoung people are doing very well in every sector, except politics. We need to consolidate as young people ahead of 2023. The only thing power listens to is power. I think that as young people we need to come together. I said this before 2019 (general elections). I said it was late for us to have a young president. Now it is a bit late because we were supposed to start (the push) immediately after the 2019 elections, but we can negotiate power. That is where diplomacy comes in. Young people can come together and make our demands clear, then have conversations with these politicians. I am a civic leader but I spend most of my time engaging politicians to do advocacy.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nOne thing we have to get in our minds is that it is not a sprint, it is a marathon and for Nigeria, it is indeed a marathon. We need to have our foot in the mud. So, 2023 for a young president? I don\u2019t see it. It is not impossible but I don\u2019t see it.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nCan we have young people step up? I definitely think that we do not just have young people. They are ready to step up. The best time to get into politics was yesterday. The next best time is today and the onus is on us; the future belongs to us. These guys kept telling us that we are the leaders of tomorrow. Even tomorrow they are still going to want to remain as leaders; that\u2019s fine if they are going to deliver a good country. This country has not been delivered to us in a state that we can own it; most of our contemporaries have left the country. We have nowhere else to go. We have no other country that we can run to. So, we are either going to fix this country or burn with it. This is why we are calling on everybody that is able. First of all, get your PVC, participate, look for a political party; it doesn\u2019t matter what they (people) say.\n\nMoremi Ojudu\n\nOur leaders are helpless without the young people. They need us and it\u2019s high time we get involved. You cannot effect a change from the outside, you have to effect the change from inside. Many of our leaders cannot even do anything without calling on a younger person.\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nLeadership and positions have no boundaries and have no age and gender. I have learnt in the past that meritocracy is the only foundation that will lead any institution forward. We must start borrowing from the model of the likes of Lee Kuan Yew, the man that instituted meritocracy (in Singapore) and appoint leaders that know that the position they are in is not a chieftaincy. People that know that immediately you are not able to demonstrate competence, impunity will come and meet you at home and you must get judgement for every wrong decision you make.",

          "text": "INDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY-FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty-first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions, and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education, and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance groundwater supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty-one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom-to-top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",
