          "text": ".\n\nAhead of the retirement of the Chief of Defence Staff and Chief of Air Staff, a frontline Civil Society Organisation, Citizen Rights Action for Peace has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to resist the temptation of extending their tenures but rather use the opportunity to overhaul the security system for better efficiency.\n\nThe CSO in a statement signed by its executive director, Sani Nurudeen explained that extending tenures of service chiefs has neither added value to the nation\u2019s military nor war against insurgency and other forms of insecurity.\n\nConsequently, the CSO argued that it was a waste of time and taxpayers\u2019 money extending tenures of persons who have not been exceptional in delivering on their responsibilities.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nN1bn compensation to Nnamdi Kanu: We\u2019ll respond after studying judgement \u2013 Army\n\n\u201cThe duo of Chief of Defence Staff, Major General L. E Irabor and Chief of Air Staff Isiaka Alao who have hit the retirement bar since last year have not done anything significant to be retained beyond their service years. We wish to remind Mr President that this practice of keeping Service Chiefs beyond their retirement dates does not add value to the security architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the president and commander in chief of the Armed forces not to allow what happened during Lt. Gen. Buratai regime to repeat itself. The security apparatus must quickly be overhauled and new blood injected into the system\u201d, the statement added.\n\nWhile we note that security is not something to be politicized, care must be taken to ensure that those saddled with the task of securing the nation do not use it as an avenue to compensate persons perceived to be loyal to them.\n\nPlaying politics with security is the single reason why Boko Haram has again taken over two Local Government Areas in Borno State. Recently, the War Institute in Biu was brazenly attacked with little or no resistance.\n\nSimilar incidences such as the persistent attacks on the Kaduna-Abuja railway and kidnappings are amongst the few fallouts of a demoralized security structure in the country.\n\nThese events are clear manifestations of weak intelligence gathering and coordination. It is, therefore, time for Mr President to restructure the entire intelligence-gathering architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is sad to note that those who failed in intelligence gathering during the era of Buratai are elevated. Intelligence is key to any meaningful security operations and as such, due diligence must be taken in ensuring that only competent persons man intelligent agencies.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to conclude that many criminal elements are taking advantage of the inefficiency of the poor intelligence system of the military in combating terror headlong as an avenue to continue to unleash mayhem on law-abiding citizens. This can only stop when new and capable persons are appointed to gather intelligence.\n\n\u201cFor some time, there have been serious security lapses that culminated to loss of lives and destruction of property with most people pointing to the failure of intelligence agencies of the military, yet no one was made to pay for the mess. To worsen the situation, none of those responsible for securing the nation voluntarily resigned or took responsibility for their lapses. They sit comfortably in their offices and do nothing.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics of war are changing especially now that insurgents and terrorists are becoming technologically advanced in their operations. It is only seasoned and experienced military officers who are abreast with current warfare tactics including the use of technologies such as drones can successfully salvage our security situation. Taking the game to the doorsteps of the terrorists is the only way to defeat them and secure the country.\n\n\u201cWe call on Mr President to immediately appoint young, vibrant and experienced officers as service chiefs so as to give Nigeria an edge over the terrorists who have so far held the country hostage because of the cluelessness of the current security chiefs\u201d, the group emphasized\u201d, the statement added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Henry Umoru, Assistant Political Editor\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has finally announced February 26 for its National Convention after a series of intrigues and pessimism on whether the event will hold next month or not.\n\nChairman of APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni cleared the coast on Tuesday last week of the date for the convention.\n\nWith the disclosure, the race for the national chairmanship of APC that had begun last year will now be intensified by various aspirants.\n\nSeveral stakeholders are making behind-the-scenes consultations on their prospects of taking over from the Caretaker National Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni, but the game from all indications and the zoning formula is over for other geo-political zones of the country as the contest has been zoned to the North Central region.\n\nBefore now, the political climate, especially within the APC family has been showing that the battle line is drawn between the Chairman, Senate Services Committee, Senator Sani Musa representing Niger East Senatorial District and some former governors for the position of National Chairman of the APC, but with the zoning of the position to the North Central, it appears that the only person contesting with Senator Musa who has been widely endorsed by Stakeholders, some governors, leaders of the party, is the former Nasarawa State governor and a serving Senator, Tanko Al- Makura.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Buni-led Caretaker committee got the nod of the party\u2019s National Executive Committee, NEC to stay on for a six-month extended period in December 2020 and also got a vote of confidence from the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, the umbrella body of governors elected on the platform of the APC.\n\nNow that the Ides of February 26 is here for the National Convention, it will then bring to an end, the administration of Buni.\n\nVanguard has gathered that at this year\u2019s National Convention, with the position of the National Chairman zoned to the North Central, Senator Sani Musa, popularly called 313 and former Governor Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State are favoured by the leadership of the APC to emerge as the national chairman of the party.\n\nVanguard gathered that before the convention, consensus would be arrived at, with the position being zeroed to Niger State and with Musa from the state, the coast is said to be clear for him.\n\nA top source in the party said that while Al-Makura is being favoured by some of the former governors, some strong forces in the Presidency, some Governors, former Governors, the Senate, very many members of the House of Representatives, Stakeholders of the party, members and supporters are backing Musa.\n\nAccording to the source, Musa has become the underdog that has long been pencilled down for the position from the North Central geo-political zone of the country against the backdrop that President Muhammadu Buhari is said not to be comfortable having a former Governor to occupy the position, thereby making the pendulum shift for Musa, a serving Senator from Niger State for the plum job.\n\nEven though some Governors are supporting Al- Makura who is their own from the Congress for Progressive Change arm of the APC was being backed by governors of the party, many are kicking against the move that a former Governor must occupy the seat.\n\nSince the APC came on board in 2013, following the merger that took place, the party has been chaired by only former State governors beginning from Chief Bisi Akande, Osun state; Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, Edo state; Comrade Adams Oshiomhole; Edo and to the incumbent National Chairman of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state.\n\nThis as gathered, is fuelling why there is a push for a paradigm shift from a former Governor to one who has not served in that capacity in Nigeria to be the head of the National Working Committee, NWC of the party.\n\nFrom all indications and now that the APC has settled that the National Chairmanship slot is narrowed down to defunct Congress for Progressive Change(CPC) bloc of the coalition that formed the party in 2013, the CPC as seen as Buhari\u2019s own party will get the chairmanship of the ruling party at the February 26 national convention of the party.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Senator Sani Musa and Tanko Al-Makura, two serving Senators of the party, are the current frontline candidates.\n\nSince the merger in 2013 that led to the victory of the APC in the 2015 general elections specifically the presidential election, the CPC bloc has not held the position of the National Chairman of the party as all the three past chairmen came from the Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN.\n\nIt was gathered that as part of moves to stabilise and sustain the APC after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari, the leader of CPC, the group has made a case for the chairmanship slot of the party while the presidential slot may have been conceded to the ACN and that may have explained why the Chairmanship slot has been zoned to the North Central with Senators Musa and Al- Makura as former CPC members and they are both close to the CPC bloc and to the President, but Musa is said to be closer.\n\nLast year, Senator Musa had advanced reasons for coming out as APC National Chairman and he said, \u201cI want to bring a new vision, a new direction in the running of the APC so as to build the most acceptable platform that will continue to foster democratic tenets for constructive development and governance.\n\n\u201cI have the backing of relevant stakeholders in the state (Niger). I have the support of the majority of the members of the National Assembly, especially the Senators and many APC governors. With their support, I will emerge the next national chairman of the APC.\u201d\n\nOne would at this juncture take a look at Senators Musa and Al- Makura, what will work in their favour and against them.\n\nMohammed Sani-Musa: The Underdog Who is in the lead to Win The Race\n\nThe Senator who is the Chairman, Senate Services Committee, representing Niger East, he is a progressive personality, with a strong history of leading high-performance teams to meet or exceed objectives.\n\nWith arguments against having ex-governors as national chairman of the party, there are strong indications that Senator Musa is the underdog because he is young, especially for the generational change that is urgently required for the APC and he has the physical energy to run the affairs of the party.\n\nThe Senator also has the support of his colleagues from his geo-political zone, the majority at the Upper Chamber, that cuts all the thirty- six states of the country, the nation\u2019s capital and including most members of the House of Representatives.\n\nIt has been gathered that as a Senator from the North Central and with arguments that no one outside of the Action Congress of Nigeria ACN tendency has ever led the party, the pendulum is shifting to Musa.\n\nSenator Musa who came from one of the legacy parties, the defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party, ANPP is therefore being favoured for the position as the Presidential ticket may likely go to another person outside of the defunct ACN and the defunct Congress for Progressive CPC tendency, President Muhammadu Buhari had to be a member of that political tendency.\n\nBesides the fact that Senator Musa is a founding member of the APC, what he has that is going for him is the fact he is reputed to be a highly organized, dedicated, passionate and hardworking person with proven integrity in all the places he has served in both public and private sector from 1986 to date.\n\nMusa\u2019s charisma and generosity have endeared him to many, including his colleagues at the senate and President Buhari. He is been supported by most members of the National Assembly who see him as one of their own and an opportunity to wrest the party from governors. He is seen as a perfect aspirant with no baggage and a National Chairman who will not spend his time visiting the anti-graft agencies to defend corruption cases.\n\nIt was also gathered that the CPC bloc has agreed to queue behind him if Al-Makura fails to sail at the convention as he has already been seen and concluded as a fallback candidate for the supporters of Al-Makura.\n\nAccording to sources, Governors and federal lawmakers would be comfortable with someone like him as national chairman of the party, just as Senators see him as an ideal aspirant with the capacity to re-engineer the internal structures and workings of the party to respond to the yearnings and aspirations of members.\n\nAlthough former governors now senators are queuing behind Al-Makura, Musa also enjoys support from the South-South and South-East Caucuses of the party outside the National Assembly, a development that has placed him as a strong contender.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAPC National Convention: Councillors in Niger endorse Sen Musa\n\nHe had been endorsed by politicians in his state, even as the state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello is said to have put behind him some political grievances and has thrown his weight behind Musa following the intervention of some very powerful persons from Niger state on the need to support their own.\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nHe is the immediate past governor of Nasarawa State, he is currently representing Nasarawa South in the Senate and Chairman, Senate Committee on Solid Minerals and another frontrunner for the position of APC National Chairman.\n\nAl-makura was elected governor of Nasarawa State in 2011 on the platform of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), a party formed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAlthough Al-Makura is said to have the support of his state governor, Abdullahi Sule and also said to have the blessing of Buhari like Senator Musa. He was credited with funding the CPC while he was governor.\n\nHis ambition has however split the Senate caucus with some senators that want Sani Musa to be the party\u2019s National Chairman.\n\nAs a member of the CPC during his reign as governor, apart from funding the party, Al- Makura was said to have formed a good relationship with Buhari and became one of the respected governors at the presidential villa when Buhari became president in 2015.\n\nHis chairmanship ambition is being supported by some of his former colleagues who were also governors, some Senators in the current 9th Assembly.\n\nWhat Al- Makura has that will count against him is his case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, just as sources said that the Caretaker Committee of the party had shut down the suggestion that he should be returned on a consensus arrangement when it had its 2-day meeting.\n\nAl-Mukara\u2019s case with the anti-graft agency was based on his administration as the governor of Nasarawa State.\n\nRecall that the senator and his wife were arrested in July 2021 for illegal retention of government funds, misappropriation and money laundering, whose proceeds were used to acquire assets such as Ta\u2019al hotel in Lafia, and some businesses.\n\nEFCC accused the couple of possessing 55 accounts being controlled by their companies, carrying out suspicious transactions, amounting to billions of naira when Mr Al-Makura was the governor of Nasarawa State between 2011 and 2019.\n\nThis may have explained why ahead of the February 26 National convention, a group under the aegis of South-South Emerging Leaders\u2019 Forum (SELF) had urged Stakeholders and leaders of the party not to elect as National Chairman, some former governors and individuals who have been indicted for some financial crimes by the EFCC and other anti-graft agencies.\n\nAccording to the group, it will be out of place for the APC to elect as National Chairman who will be the head of the National Working Committee, NWC a person who is being indicted by the EFCC and others.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, the National Coordinator of the group, Barrister Preye Wilson, warned that as a ruling party, the party does not need a national chairman that will be moved in and out of the anti-corruption agencies\u2019 offices to explain their dealings in the past.\n\nThe National Coordinator of South-South Emerging Leaders\u2019 Forum, SELF who was reacting to a write-up titled, \u201cthe APC faces integrity test, five chairmanship aspirants on EFCC radar, had said that it is time for the ruling party to deviate from past experiences of electing former governor as national chairman, even as he warned that if any of these allegedly indicted chairmanship aspirants is elected as a national chairman the party will be easily blackmailed by the opposition parties and other critics.\n\nA National Newspaper( not Vanguard) had argued that \u201cPresident Buhari, who claims the fight against corruption is the cornerstone of his administration, has constantly frowned against corrupt persons taking up positions of leadership. With some of the aspirants still battling cases at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, will the President as the leader of the party, and the APC hierarchy be willing to look the other way or will they insist that anyone is free to contest? Providing an answer to this question would require looking into the profiles of the 11 aspirants.\u201d\n\nHowever, the South-south forum has urged that the party delegates and leaders at all levels should consider Senator Mohammed Sani Musa\u2019s integrity, track records, firmness and simplicity among those parading themselves as chairmanship aspirants in APC.\n\nWilson had said, \u201cFor us in the South-south Emerging Leaders\u2019 Forum, we believe that the best way the ruling party can continue to discourage corruption as clearly stated in the agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari is to elect a new national chairman that\u2019s free of EFCC or ICPC cases.\n\n\u201cWe also note that since the successful merger process the produced the ruling APC former governors have had enough time. From our father former governor of Osun state Chief Bisi Akande, who was succeeded by another former governor of Edo state Chief John Odigie Oyegun and later to another former governor of Edo state Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, we feel it is time to try a Senator and a competent hand at that.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, Senate President and Speaker, former and serving governors, and all the APC leaders at all levels to support the aspiration of Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from Niger state to emerge the next national chairman of APC.\n\n\u201cThis we believe that governing APC will not regret. We have taken our time to investigate all the aspirants, we have listened to them on the various platform and also read about their plans for the party and therefore come to a conclusion that Senator representing Niger East is currently the best to lead an anti-corruption political party among other indices.\u201d\n\nAs the battle takes place on February 26 between the underdog and an ex-Governor, we watch as events unfold.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Five persons released by pirates who hijacked their boat on their way from the Safe Journey beach in Calabar, Cross River State, to Oron beach in Akwa Ibom State on January 17, 2021, have said other victims, including a Professor from the University of Calabar and a naval officer, may lose their lives if they are unable to raise N3 million each.\n\nThe Calabar channel is manned by the Marine Police and the Nigerian Navy.\n\nThe pirates, on Wednesday, blindfolded and released a four-year-old child, a pregnant woman, an injured person, an elderly woman and the driver of the boat at Akpabuyo Local Government Area of Cross River State.\n\nThe released victims, who recounted their ordeal, said they heard them vow that if by weekend those still in their den cannot pay the ransom then they will be killed.\n\nThe driver of the speed boat, Bassey Udo Essien, who is now in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) told newsmen how the hijack took place, adding that the pirates were heavily armed.\n\nHe said he was freed to go in order to take one of the victims who was fatally wounded by the pirates\u2019 bullets for treatment because the abductors had no form of medication in the camp.\n\n\u201cIn the morning of Monday, 17 January 2022, we loaded from Calabar to Oron. Immediately we passed all the rounds and close to the Marine police at about 9:00 AM, we drove in the middle of the water because if we drive by the side of the water those sea pirates will quickly attack us. Just a few minutes, about ten minutes drive we saw them driving to meet us, I increased the speed of our boat to the highest but unfortunately, it was not fast enough because our engine is 115 (horsepower) while theirs is 200 (horsepower).\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t slow down because I was trying to escape from them, they started shooting. They shot sporadically at us and unfortunately, the bullet caught one of the passengers by the name Jesam on the face, close to the ear who sat at the second bench of the boat.\n\n\u201cThose pirates were up to eight in their boat fully armed with an AK-47 rifle, some masked their faces while some did not mask face, although I don\u2019t know any of them.\n\n\u201cI was speeding up to cross to the Marine Police territory so they can return but my boat cannot speed than their own. They Kidnapped us and took us to one dangerous creek, we just departed Calabar and had not approached Oron. At the creek where they took us, they robbed us and collected every single thing we had \u2013 phones, money, shoes, wristwatches, bags, ATM cards, necklace, my boat; everything and also beat us.\n\n\u201cThe rest are still in their camp, they are demanding three million Naira for each of us and we are 17 of us. I and the passenger who sustained gunshot wounds, Jesam did not escape they saw he was at the point of death with the gun injury since on Monday and maybe they thought if they allow him there he might die because nothing like treatment in their creek. They collected his phone, money, laptop and since I was the one taking care of the man there, they collected my money about N49,000, phone seized my boat and allowed me to go with him. They beat me up and forced me to tell them my ATM pin which I don\u2019t know if they have removed everything in the account because they collected my sim card as well.\n\n\u201cThey carried five of us in their boat and told us to lay down. The five of us they freed to go were; one pregnant woman, an aged woman and a boy of about four years and are still left with 12 more persons in their camp. They dumped us where we don\u2019t even know or find our way somewhere in Akpabuyo, let\u2019s say 10:00 AM because I have no time with me. Luckily for me and Jesam we were able to find a bike.\n\n\u201cWe were seven (7) girls and ten (10) boys in the boat. My fear for those girls is that those pirates might rape them.\n\n\u201cThere was a Navy personnel amongst us but we didn\u2019t disclose the person because they saw the uniform and asked who the person was, they would have killed the personnel or any uniform man. I told them the uniform is a waybill. The place they kept us is so horrible, mosquitoes and other insects biting us. They kept women one side, men one side.\n\n\u201cWhile they were taking us to their camp, they forced us to close our eyes and bend down without looking up to see where they were taking us to. Even while they were taking five of us out to free, they blindfolded our eyes, especially mine. It was a terrible experience; they will cook whatever and anyhow food they like and say if you like you eat if you don\u2019t, leave.\n\n\u201cEight of them came to kidnap us but in their camp, they are so many, they don\u2019t even have one camp, we learnt they have up to three camps \u2013 outside the camp, inside the camp and their main camp which they took us to their outside camp, how much more their inside and main camps. One of the victims who tried escaping was recaptured and was well beaten.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari returns to Dodan Barracks, 37 years later, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "On August 27, 1985, he was taken out of Dodan Barracks, the then seat of government, in Ikoyi, Lagos, by those who had overthrown him in what was popularly called a palace coup.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was not to return to a place that was his abode for 20 months, and from where he administered the country, till January 13, 2022, almost 37 years later.\n\nDodan Barracks is that military garrison that originated from the site of a battle during the Burma campaign of World War 2 by the 82nd West African Division, which had a strong Nigerian contingent. The Barracks became the official residence of military heads of state after their incursion into governance, and the Supreme Military Headquarters during the Nigerian Civil War, which lasted between 1967 and 1970. It was there that Gen. Yakubu Gowon received the formal surrender of the Biafran forces. Murtala Muhammed lived there as head of state. Olusegun Obasanjo did, and Muhammadu Buhari, too.\n\nIn April 1990, some daredevil mid-level officers, led by Major Gideon Orkar, stormed Dodan Barracks, attempting to overthrow Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who had led the 1985 coup and succeeded Buhari as head of state. And from then, what was hitherto a fortress began to lose its invincibility. By December of the following year, Babangida moved to Abuja, to the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, which remains the seat of Federal Government till today.\n\nBack to August 27, 1985. Babangida, popularly called IBB, was Chief of Army Staff. He had installed his loyalists, called IBB Boys, in sensitive command positions over the months. And while Buhari, and his deputy, Babatunde Idiagbon, were busy trying to retool the country, salvage the economy, reorientate the people towards discipline and diligence, IBB had his eyes on power, and was plotting.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBuhari trusts, implicitly. He\u2019s still the same way today. So he left the Army completely to Babangida, while he concentrated on the salvage work, fighting corruption, knocking order into the system. IBB and his boys then struck.\n\nWhen the head of state was first arrested, he was reportedly taken to Bonny Camp, a military formation in Victoria Island, Lagos, from where he was moved to a detention facility in Benin, Edo State. He was to be there for over three years, while they went through his affairs with a fine tooth comb. Nothing was found against him. He was eventually released to live his life as a retired army officer in his Daura, Katsina home.\n\nBuhari left Dodan Barracks as a captive in 1985. He returned there last week, not only as a free man, but as President of the country, democratically elected, and running to the end of a second term in office. Right is the person who said the downfall of a man is not the end of his life. And right also is that man who said some setbacks are mere stepping stones in life. And of course, right is the Good Book, that infallible book, when it says: \u201cIt is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.\u201d (1 Corinthians 15: 43).\n\nWhere are most of those who plotted to remove Buhari from power today? Not as well favored as the man. They stopped what was a sure move of Nigeria to a solid, stable, disciplined land, where probity and accountability would be the order of the day, and gave us what was worse than business as usual. They bastardized and corrupted all our institutions, raped democracy, and left the country in a turmoil, topsy-turvy. But 30 years after the self-serving overthrow, Nigerians themselves brought Buhari back to power in 2015. They did it again in 2019. The stone that the builders rejected had become the head of the corner.\n\nHow did Buhari\u2019s return to Dodan Barracks happen? It was in this wise: Head of the Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan, had died. The President was billed to visit Ogun State, to commission some landmark projects done by Governor Dapo Abiodun. Why not kill two birds with one stone? It was decided that after finishing in Abeokuta, President Buhari would proceed to the home of the Shonekans, in Ikoyi, Lagos, to condole with the family.\n\nThe Ogun trip took us to Ijebu area, then to the capital, Abeokuta, where five projects were commissioned in all. It was an exacting, grueling schedule. But trust President Buhari. When he has set his heart on something, he gets it done.\n\nWe flew in helicopters from Abeokuta, direct to a field in Dodan Barracks, the former seat of power. There, a convoy of vehicles was waiting, and we drove through the former abode of our number one citizens, came out at Alagbon, and then to the old Federal Secretariat, long abandoned, and now an eyesore on the landscape.\n\nI saw the monument erected for Murtala Muhammed. He had been assassinated at that spot on February 13: 1976, while driving to the office from Dodan Barracks.\n\nSoon, we drove into Lugard Street, where the Shonekans live. The President condoled with the family, as led by Margaret, the widow. The job done, we entered our vehicles, almost about 5 pm, and drove again through Dodan Barracks, where we boarded the choppers, to Murtala Muhammed Airport in Ikeja, and back to Abuja, arriving at dusk.\n\nAs we drove through Dodan Barracks, I saw vestiges of a former fortified city, where men of power lived. But the place had lost its glory. Structures had been erected indiscriminately everywhere, the buildings were dilapidating, and surely needed new coats of paints. The tall fence, with barbed wires, were standing like a flag at half-mast. Thy glory oh Dodan Barracks is slain upon the high places. How are the mighty fallen! Right was William Shakespeare, in his portrait of the seasons of life, when he said, \u201cLast scene of all,\n\nThat ends this strange and eventful history,\n\nIs second childishness and mere oblivion,\n\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\u201d\n\nThat is the state of Dodan Barracks. Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. I could not believe what I saw of the former seat of power. Unkempt is the word.\n\nBack in Abuja, I went to meet President Buhari. I wanted to know if it was his first visit to Dodan Barracks since that fateful day in August 1985 when he was taken away involuntarily, and what were his feelings about the state of the place?\n\n\u201cYes, it was my fist visit since the day I was removed. I\u2019d not been back since then, till that day,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the general outlook of the place?\n\n\u201cI was really surprised at what I saw. I couldn\u2019t have found my way through, if I was alone. The place had changed! I wonder why they lost control of the aesthetics, with buildings erected indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nIt is said that the then President Obasanjo had ceded Dodan Barracks to the Police in 2004. True? If so, why is it not maintained? Why is there no development control? Our past military leaders lived there. It is part of our history. Even if it is to turn it to a national monument, Dodan Barracks needs to be preserved for posterity.\n\nI remember the tall, young, gangling Muhammadu Buhari, and his unsmiling kindred spirit, Tunde Idiagbon, holding court in those days in Dodan Barracks. They wanted to knock sense into our head as a people. Forces of revision knocked them out. And that fortress itself has been kayoed. Enfeebled. Anesthetized. Who will energize and invigorate Dodan Barracks again? A vital part of our history goes, if that place goes down.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

Boko haram is in retreat. Boko Haram has been degraded in many areas. Boko Haram is like a virus looking for ways to adapt and sustain its own life.\n\n\u201cNigerians like to summarise it all by saying kinetic and non-kinetic interventions. What has become is that the kinetic operations which mostly involved the military and security forces would do so well on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cBut, we must also address the issue that have provoked acts of terrorism and banditry that becomes a question of security.\n\n\u201cFor Boko Haram, there is the issue of social infrastructure about the human development, and access to safety nets.\n\n\u201cOver the years in our country, we have had the degrading of social infrastructure and our safety nets.\n\n\u201cThere is research that suggests for instance that the more out-of-school children you have, the more prone you are to disruptions because if you have out-of -school populations that are huge, they serve as reserved army and foot soldiers for any kind of uprising.\u201d\n\nOsaghae expressed the agency\u2019s readiness to strengthen its capacities and deliverables in 2022.\n\nThe DG said this is in accordance with the agency\u2019s mandate of core mandate of research, promotion of interest and understanding of Interantional affairs.\n\nProfessor Osaghae explained that collaboration with other countries is inexcusable in this regard.\n\nThe DG noted that the agency has lined up 10 new collaborations within the first quarter of the year.\n\n\u201cAs a think-tank, we want to strengthen our capacities and our deliverables in the areas of our core mandate of research, promotion of interest and understanding of Interantional affairs.\n\n\u201cTo do this, we need the kind of collaboration that we saw today.\n\n\u201cExpanding the frontiers of our collaboration, this year we have lined up 10 new collaborations within the first quarter of the year.\u201d The DG stated.\n\nSpeaking on the rationale behind the roundtable, Professor Osaghae said it is engage in collaborative research, collaborative studies and exchange of researchers who would focus on the particular needs of both countries.\n\nHe explained that they have been able to identify the defence industry such as the military and other security forces, including trade and economic relations.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of the roundtable discussion is to do collaborative research, collaborative studies and we have exchange of researchers who would focus on a particular needs of the countries.\n\n\u201cWe identified the defense industry as key.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nDecision on removal of subsidy on petroleum would be made in June when the provision for its payment in the 2022 budget expires, the National Economic Council (NEC), has said.\n\nResponding to questions while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of the meeting, Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdulahi Sule, said it was understandable that the provision for the payment of the subsidy is made in the 2022 budget only until June.\n\nSule, who briefed alongside his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, said any decision on removal of subsidy would be taken after the budget provision runs its course in June.\n\nHe said though NEC, through a committee it has set up on the issue, has been having a conversation on the matter, it was yet to take a stand on it.\n\nNassarawa governor said: \u201cWhat you have to understand is that we didn\u2019t make any presentation on this because there has not been a decision. But in reality, all of us Nigerians know that there is now the Petroleum Industry Act. And NNPC has now become a limited liability company. So, NNPC will run differently. So, if the minister of finance provides for six months, you probably can understand part of the reason for provision of six months before NNPC fully takes off and at that moment, that\u2019s when decisions will be made.\n\n\u201cBut I want to make the correction that it is not governors who are making recommendations. It is actually a NEC committee, you know, which comprises of all the other people that are looking at this and no decision has been made and probably by the time a decision will be made, you know, the Petroleum Industry Act would have fully taken charge, and it will not require any recommendation from anybody.\u201d\n\nAlso responding to questions, Obaseki pointed out that Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), which sells for N162-165 per litre in Nigeria, sells for over 100 percent higher in neighbouring countries.\n\nHe said the Federal Government was spending about N2 trillion on petroleum subsidy, an amount he said could have been channelled to the nation\u2019s infrastructure, education, healthcare among others.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAccording to Obaseki, the NEC, therefore, wondered whether that should be allowed to continue in a situation where he observed only two thirds of the states of the federation consume the subsidy.\n\n\u201cAs you all know and aware, the issue of subsidy has been one matter that NEC has deliberated on, for more than a year now. There was an ad hoc committee, which was set up by NEC headed by Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State that included members of the executive who worked on recommendations as to what we should do about the costs of PMS locally because as you realise, as has been told us, the cost of PMS in Nigeria today is about N162 per litre. Whereas every other country surrounding Nigeria is selling the same product at more than 100 percent of the cost in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to have the exact figures, but we must have spent almost N2 trillion subsidising petroleum products. That is money that could have gone into building roads, money that could have gone into healthcare and education. And so for NEC, the arguments have been put out, should we continue this regime of spending money we do not have to subsidise the living standards of only mostly those who have vehicles? \u201cAnd when NEC looked at some of the analysis last year, we then realised less than one third of the states of this country consume two thirds of the subsidy. So, the issue of equity also came up. All of these findings were presented to NEC and NEC has had several deliberations. And the deliberations are still ongoing. So, NEC has not come up with any decision yet. I think recommendations have also been made to the president. That is what I am aware has transpired so far.\u201d\n\nAsked if complaints of governors on illegal deductions to pay subsidy was addressed, Obaseki said: \u201cNo, no, no no. What was presented to NEC today was a document for us to note the decision that was reached by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\u201cThey had met, they had brought up the constitutional issue about deductions of 13 percent derivation, which should have occurred before any expenditure. So, this was a constitutional issue, which had been dealt with. And it was realised refunds had to be made as a result of those unconstitutional deductions and it was agreed how those refunds should be paid whether it was to be paid in three years or in four years or in five years. That was what was brought to NEC for noting.\u201d\n\nAsked how subsidy deductions was affecting states, the Edo governor said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll put it very succinctly\u2026as at last year, NNPC was supposed to contribute N200 billion a month to FAAC for distribution to the states. But because of the payment of subsidy, NNPC was unable to put that money into FAAC for distribution, which means less money going to the states and less money going to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nOn if states can survive, Nasarawa Governor responded, \u201cwe are surviving now.\u201d",

          "text": "*Vows never to let anyone impose himself on Nigerians\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, while inaugurating some projects in different parts of Kaduna State, gave a generous pass mark to the Northwestern state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, saying he was writing history in letters of gold.\n\nBuhari, who confessed to having taken El-Rufai\u2019s loyalty for granted, and went on to profusely thank him, however, vowed never to let anyone raise an army of thugs with a view to forcing himself on Nigerians, as the nation journeys through the next national elections.\n\nThe president was in Kaduna for a two-day working visit, and arrived Wednesday night from Banjul, Gambia, where he attended the inauguration of President Adama Barrow, for a second term of office.\n\nBuhari, who flew in a helicopter, landed at the Murtala Square and commissioned the remodelled Square.\n\nReceived by El-Rufai and top government functionaries, the president commenced his activities in Kafanchan, where he commissioned some road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme, before returning to Kaduna at about 11:45am.\n\nAt the Murtala Square, the new city centre of Kaduna State, the president, while admiring the remodelled edifice, recalled that he was constrained by family challenges to relocate from Daura to Kaduna, after he was released from detention as a former military Head of State.\n\n\u201dI can hardly find my way in Kaduna due to the development taking place here and the governor, has committed himself to change Kaduna for good and has been very successful at that, and Nigerians are appreciative that you are writing your history in letters of gold,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet, another instance, an overly impressed Buhari added: \u201cThank you very much, Your Excellency, and remarkably, you became my governor. I don\u2019t think I have any input. Zainab became my minister of finance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you are from the gentleman I respect and go to his house (apparently referring to El-Rufai). This is fabulous coincidence and I thank God for it. Therefore, I have taken your loyalty for granted,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nStill in Kafanchan, Buhari underlined his resolve to consolidate the country\u2019s political system to improve the quality of the people\u2019s lives, because \u201cthe people matter.\u201d\n\nAddressing the palace of Alhaji Muhammadu Isa II, the Emir of Jama\u2019a, Buhari said, \u201cWe are doing our efforts to consolidate the system for the good of the people because they matter.\u201d\n\nHe used the opportunity to speak about the use of the police and the military, in dealing with security situations but urged Nigerians to develop confidence in civil authority to build a system \u201cfree of chaos.\u201d\n\nBuhari, therefore, reiterated that, \u201cNobody should be allowed to raise an army of thugs to force himself on the people. This must be very clear.\u201d\n\nThe president further gave assurances of the determination of his administration \u201cto hand over a better Nigeria than the one we inherited,\u201d and urged Nigerians to be fair in their assessment of what his government has achieved especially, on the campaign promises he made ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nThe president, who inaugurated the newly remodelled Murtala Mohammed Square, also unveiled the 136-bed Infectious Disease Hospital, LEA Lokoja Road Primary School, Rigasa, Aliyu Makama road and the Leventis underpass, executed by the State government.\n\nHe praised Governor El-Rufai for completing people-oriented projects in the Kaduna metropolis as well as other senatorial districts in the state.\n\nAlso, while inaugurating the 800-metre long flyover in Kawo, Kaduna, amid tight security, the president recounted how he narrowly escaped a targeted bomb attack in the vicinity in 2014.\n\nReminiscing on the unfortunate incident, which claimed the lives of many innocent Nigerians, Buhari thanked God for sparing his life on that fateful day along Ali Akilu road, Kawo-Kaduna.\n\nHis words: \u201dFor many years, I always plied this route and I cannot recount how many times I crossed it. There was an attempt on my life on this road. Nothing happened to me just like the 30 months I spent during the civil war.\n\n\u201dThey wanted to blow up the vehicle I was in around the secretariat but my escort somehow stopped them. But before we came to this bridge (Kawo), they became more desperate and there was a small market in the area, where the device exploded. But God protected us and here I am again,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter commissioning the newly constructed Dan Haya Road, Katsina Road and the Emir\u2019s Palace Road in Kafanchan, Buhari, Buhari stated again, \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the rehabilitation of the town (Kafanchan) I have seen.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents of the area to show appreciation for the projects, and commended the Emir, for his consolidation of peace among the diverse ethnic and religious communities of the Emirate.\n\nIn his remarks, El-Rufa\u2019i acknowledged the President\u2019s investments in security in the area, noting in particular that the establishment of security outfits, had paved the way for reduced attacks on people, stating categorically that Kafanchan was much safer today than it used to be.\n\nThe Emir, in acknowledging the improvements in security in the area, requested permanent bases for the Air Force and the Mobile Police, as well as the restoration of the rail services for which Kafanchan was known.\n\nBuhari was welcomed to the community by the Senator and Members of the House of Representatives from the zone, as well as a large crowd of enthusiastic citizens, who thronged the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, a combined team of heavily armed soldiers and the police were deployed to strategic places in the state while helicopters were seen hovering around the city.\n\nKaduna is one of the northwest states under constant attacks by bandits with people being killed or abducted almost on a daily basis.\n\nBuhari is expected to be in Zaria today to commission more road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme.\n\nCuriously, however, the visit was without the usual fanfare and celebrations as not many people came out on the street to welcome him.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert heavy strain on the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is proposing a $50 billion trust fund which could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to build resilience and sustainability.\n\nThe trust fund is part of IMF\u2019s options for channeling some of the $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued in August 2021 to countries with strong external financial positions as well as vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).\n\nThe IMF in a new blog post yesterday, stated that the proposed $50 billion trust fund could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries build resilience to balance of payments shocks and ensure a sustainable recovery\n\nIt stated that about three quarters of IMF\u2019s membership could qualify for the RST financing, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and all middle-income countries with per capita gross national income (GNI) below 10 times the 2020\n\nInternational Development Association (IDA) operational cut-off , or about $12,000.\n\nNigeria falls within the category of potential beneficiaries as\n\nGNI per capita in the country was reported at $2,157 in 2019, based on the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognised sources.\n\nTo qualify for RST support, an eligible IMF member would need a package of high-quality policy measures consistent with the RST\u2019s purpose; a concurrent financing or non-financing IMF-supported programme with appropriate macroeconomic policies to mitigate risks for borrowers and creditors; and sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the Fund.\n\nThe IMF noted that access to RST financing would be determined case-by-case, based on the strength of reforms and debt sustainability considerations, and was expected to be capped at 150 per cent of IMF quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is smaller.\n\nIt added that RST lending would be part of a broader financing strategy members would pursue to address longer-term balance of payments risks, involving a mix of multilateral, bilateral official, and private financing.\n\nLike the IMF\u2019s highly concessional and currently zero interest rate Trust for low-income countries, the RST\u2019s resources would be mobilised on a voluntary basis from members who wish to channel their SDRs or currencies for the benefit of poorer or vulnerable countries.\n\nThe IMF stated: \u201cEven as countries continue to battle COVID-19, it is crucial not to overlook the longer-term challenge of transforming economies to become more resilient to shocks and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has taught us that not addressing these long-term challenges in a timely manner can have significant economic consequences, with the potential for future balance of payments problems.\n\n\u201cClimate change is another long-term challenge that threatens macroeconomic stability and growth in many countries through natural disasters and disruptions to industries, job markets, and trade flows, among others.\n\n\u201cThese are global public policy challenges, and it is the shared responsibility of individual countries and the international community to take timely actions.\u201d\n\nThe Fund noted that in a previous blog, it had explained how it was considering options for channeling some of the $650 billion SDRs issued in August 2021 from countries with strong external financial positions to vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust.\n\nIt added that the RST\u2019s central objective was to provide affordable long-term financing to support countries as they tackle structural challenges.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve continued to work toward developing the RST, our current thinking on the key design features\u2014which we outline further below\u2014aim to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowing countries.\n\n\u201cWith broad support from the membership and international partners, we hope that the Trust can be approved by the IMF Executive Board before the upcoming Spring Meetings and for it to become fully operational before the year\u2019s end,\u201d the IMF stated in the blog post.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says petrol costs 100% more in neighbouring countries\n\n*Reveals that N2trn spent on subsidy in 2021\n\n*Accuses NNPC of failing to fund FAAC to the tune of N200bn monthly in 2021\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe National Economic Council (NEC) yesterday allayed fears of Nigerians about the possible removal of fuel subsidy early in 2022, saying the policy would remain for now.\n\nIt, however, did not rule out the possibility of the subsidy being removed before the end of this year.\n\nThese formed part of the resolutions of NEC at its maiden meeting in 2022 held at the Conference Hall of the State House, Abuja, with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo presiding.\n\nNEC which meets monthly is constitutionally empowered to advise the president on nation\u2019s economic matters.\n\nThe federal government had disclosed plan to phase out the fuel subsidy regime by the second half of this year.\n\nThe World Bank had also last November sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see the federal and state governments unable to pay salaries this year.\n\nBut a member of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Economic Advisory Council, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, recently warned that some of the economic reforms outlined by the federal government in 2022, especially the fuel subsidy removal, may be hampered by political considerations and labour union activities.\n\nHowever, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa state and his Edo state counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, were on hand to brief newsmen at the end of the meeting that lasted for four hours.\n\nWhen asked if fuel subsidy removal was discussed at the meeting, Obaseki said though Council discussed the issue, no decision was taken on the matter.\n\nHe added that statistics had shown that over N2 trillion was spent on fuel subsidy in 2021, while reports had also shown that prices of petroleum products were 100 percent higher in neighboring countries than what is obtainable in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe issue of subsidy has been one matter that NEC has deliberated on, for more than a year now. There was an Adhoc Committee which was set up by NEC headed by Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna state that included members of the executive arm of government that worked on recommendations as to what we should do about the costs of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) locally because as you realise, as has been told us, the cost of PMS in Nigeria today is about N162 per liter. Whereas every other country surrounding Nigeria is selling the same product at more than 100 per cent of the cost in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd the country as at last year, spent in excess of almost, I mean, we need to have the exact figures, but we must have spent almost N2 trillion subsidising petroleum products. That is money that could have gone into building roads, money that could have gone into healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cSo, for NEC, the arguments have been put out, should we continue this regime of spending money we do not have to subsidise the living standards of only mostly those who have vehicles? And when NEC looked at some of the analysis last year, we then realised that less than one-third of the states of this country consume two thirds of the subsidy. So, the issue of equity also came up.\n\n\u201cAll of these findings were presented to NEC and NEC has had several deliberations. And the deliberations are still ongoing.\n\n\u201cSo, NEC hasn\u2019t come up with any decision yet. I think recommendations have also been made to the President. That is what I am aware of that transpired so far.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Nasarawa state governor emphasised that no decision had been taken on the issue of fuel subsidy.\n\nHe added that with the NNPC now becoming a limited liability company, it would now have to run differently in the area of fuel pricing regime.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that we didn\u2019t make any presentations on the fuel subsidy because there has not been a decision. But in reality, all of us Nigerians know that there is now the Petroleum Industry Act. And NNPC has now become, you know, a limited liability company. So NNPC will run differently.\n\n\u201cSo, if the Minister of Finance, you know, provides for six months, you probably can understand part of the reason for provision of six months before NNPC fully takes off and at that moment, that\u2019s when decisions will be made.\n\n\u201cBut I want to make the correction that it is not governors who are making recommendations. It is actually a NEC committee, you know, which comprises of all the other people that are looking at this and no decision has been made.\n\n\u201cProbably at the appropriate time, a decision will be made. You know, the Petroleum Industry Act has fully taken charge, and it will not require any recommendation from anybody\u201d.\n\nAsked if NEC took any decision on the complaints of governors about unconstitutional deductions, Sule stated that what was presented to NEC was a document on the decision that was reached by the Federal Revenue Allocation Committee (FAAC)\n\nHe explained that FAAC brought up the constitutional issue about deductions of 13 per cent derivation, which should have occurred before any expenditures.\n\nThe governor stressed that this was a constitutional issue, which had been dealt with.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd it was realised that refunds had to be made as a result of those unconstitutional deductions and it was agreed how those refunds should be paid back whether it was to be paid in three years or in four years or in five years.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Edo state governor put it succinctly that the deductions had really affected the states financially.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cAs at last year, NNPC was supposed to contribute N200 billion a month to FAAC for distribution to the States. Because of payment of subsidy, NNPC was unable to put that money into FAAC for distribution, which means less money going to the states and less money going to the federal government.\u201d\n\nFG Cannot Push Consequences of its Inefficiency to Nigerians, Says NLC President\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday insisted that the planned removal of petrol subsidy by the federal government was tantamount to leaving Nigerians to bear the consequence of in-built inefficiency in the product supply value chain.\n\nSpeaking on a national television yesterday, the National President of the NLC, Mr Ayuba Waba, reiterated the body\u2019s earlier decision to embark on a warning protest on January 27, over the matter.\n\nWabba maintained that the removal of subsidy would cause more pains to Nigerians and push millions into poverty, arguing that as it is, inflation has also already rendered wages and salaries valueless.\n\nThe NLC helmsman noted that the federal government cannot be talking about subsidy removal when it imports all its products, explaining that the first point to start is to begin local refining.\n\nHe posited that the refineries have not worked for years because there are certain highly placed individuals who benefit from the importation of products.\n\nHe pointed out that labour had engaged government for the past 20 years over the matter and proffered solutions, including building the country\u2019s refining capacity.\n\n\u201cWe must be able to refine product for domestic use, and that is what most OPEC countries are doing. We should not rely 100 per cent on importation of petrol and other petroleum products.\n\n\u201cOne, we\u2019re exporting our jobs, not only exporting jobs, we are also imposing a burden on many Nigerians. In fact, we can take over the entire West Africa markets if we\u2019re able to refine products for domestic use,\u201d he noted.\n\nWabba explained that while the government may have started work on the Port Harcourt refinery, all the refineries are still moribund, adding that government has broken its promises several times in the past to revamp the facilities.\n\nAccording to him, modular refineries can actually address the perennial issue of shortage of gas and diesel and also bring down the price which has continued to rise as well as pushing the prices of foodstuff beyond ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cDiesel is almost going for between N340 per litre and N360, depending on where you\u2019re buying. And then it will make transportation so expensive, and therefore costs of goods and services that will also depend on transportation. Those costs will be built into it. So, those are the issues.\n\n\u201cThere is confusion. How much of petrol do we consume? Do we know? And that is why we have said that the inefficiency that is in the system should not actually be transferred to consumers to continue to carry,\u201d he explained.\n\nWabba opined that government\u2019s position that the high volume of consumption is due to products that are being smuggled across the borders does not hold water, stating that it will take hundreds of tankers to take that volume out of the country.\n\n\u201cIf you are to look at the gap between 38 million litres and 102 million litres, it means that on a daily basis, 200 trucks will be smuggling products across the country. And this is an issue we have interrogated in the past.\n\n\u201cWe have given recommendation, the first is that they must build refineries around those borders, so that we can also take a comparative advantage of all the neighbouring countries, but today, nothing has happened.\n\n\u201cSo basically, clearly there is no transparency and therefore the issue of how much we consume per day is still a mystery. And this is not rocket science,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, the use of an alternative fuel like compressed natural gas to reduce the number of vehicles that use petrol has also been left hanging.\n\n\u201cTo use natural gas, I remember that about N260 billion was actually committed to the issue of conversion of vehicles. But there\u2019s nothing on the table. So that\u2019s why everybody\u2019s concerned that promises have been made and we have documentation, we have reports, but none of those promises are being kept. So it\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d he posited.\n\nAlso, ahead of the January 27 nationwide protest against the purported plan to remove fuel subsidy, the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) said that its branches all over the country had adequately mobilised in line with the directive of the NLC for the protest.\n\nSpeaking at its 41st Regular National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State yesterday, SSANU President, Mr. Mohammed Haruna Ibrahim, accused the federal government of not being sensitive to the pains the citizens were going through while taking its decisions.\n\nIbrahim said as an affiliate of the NLC, SSANU would participate actively in the proposed protest.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the next few days, the Nigeria Labour Congress is mobilising all Nigerian workers both formal and informal to protest this evil and very unpatriotic thought of removing fuel subsidy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have it in good authority that about N200 will be added to the N162 or N170 depending on where you are buying as fuel price in Nigeria. This, the NLC in which SSANU is an affiliate, totally rejects and will participate fully in this protest across Nigeria on the 27th of this month.\n\n\u201cThe present federal government of Nigeria is not doing any better in its relationship with our labour unions. SSANU in particular is facing the most difficult period of its existence because our members are going through a lot in terms of hardship, in terms of denial.\n\n\u201cWe have had a 2009 agreement which is about 12 years down the line, just less than 40 per cent of that agreement has seen the light of the day. Even those that have seen the light of the day, they are coming in different forms and sizes that are not encouraging and not also friendly to our membership.\n\n\u201cToday what our members go through is mutilation of salaries, none payment of promises made such as that of the new minimum wage arrears, none implementation or partial or lopsided payment of the hazard and responsibility allowance, issues of staff schools that have become an issue of concern to all our membership.\n\n\u201cFunding of state universities has become so terrible, some universities in Nigeria of state extraction suffer 12 months or two, three years of none payment of salaries and allowances. Inter university centers that are supposed to be part of our struggle have been denied of their legitimate rights and privileges of accessing allowances that have been approved and agreed upon with the federal government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe renegotiation of the 2009 Agreement is still wobbling and dancing. We also see today in our Nigerian universities this dangerous and reckless usurpation of our duties of our members by some Vice Chancellors who give out our duties as specified in our callings to other people who do not know better than we do.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The RST\u2019s resources would be mobilised on a voluntary basis from members who wish to channel their SDRs or currencies for the benefit of poorer or vulnerable countries.\u201d\n\nIt added that about three-quarters of members may be eligible for RST financing, adding that it would include all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and all middle-income countries with per capita GNI below 10 times the 2020 IDA operational cutoff, or about $12,000.\n\nNigeria falls within the category of potential beneficiaries as GNI per capita in the country was reported at $2,157 in 2019, based on the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognised sources.\n\nHighlighting requirements, IMF said the country must be a member of IMF and have a package of high-quality policy measures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo qualify for RST support, an eligible IMF member would need a package of high-quality policy measures consistent with the RST\u2019s purpose; a concurrent financing or non-financing IMF-supported programme with appropriate macroeconomic policies to mitigate risks for borrowers and creditors, and sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the fund,\u201d IMF added.\n\nIt also noted that access to RST financing would be determined case-by-case, based on the strength of reforms and debt sustainability considerations, and was expected to be capped at 150 percent of IMF quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is smaller.\n\nIn addition, RST lending would be part of a broader financing strategy members would pursue to address the longer-term balance of payments risks, involving a mix of multilateral, bilateral official, and private financing.\n\nIt, however, called for collaboration from economically stronger IMF members willing to provide resources to help with long term sustainability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe RST will support such a collaborative effort. We will build on our experience of working with the World Bank and other international institutions and regional development banks, complementing their lending to provide the best support to member countries,\u201d IMF stated.\n\n\u201cThe success of the new Trust will depend equally on economically stronger IMF members providing meaningful resources to help countries improve long-term resilience and sustainability; borrowers willing to go the extra mile to achieve the macroeconomic environment and reform framework conducive to improving the balance of payments stability.\u201d",

The RST\u2019s resources would be mobilised on a voluntary basis from members who wish to channel their SDRs or currencies for the benefit of poorer or vulnerable countries.\u201d\n\nIt added that about three-quarters of members may be eligible for RST financing, adding that it would include all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and all middle-income countries with per capita GNI below 10 times the 2020 IDA operational cutoff, or about $12,000.\n\nNigeria falls within the category of potential beneficiaries as GNI per capita in the country was reported at $2,157 in 2019, based on the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognised sources.\n\nHighlighting requirements, IMF said the country must be a member of IMF and have a package of high-quality policy measures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo qualify for RST support, an eligible IMF member would need a package of high-quality policy measures consistent with the RST\u2019s purpose; a concurrent financing or non-financing IMF-supported programme with appropriate macroeconomic policies to mitigate risks for borrowers and creditors, and sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the fund,\u201d IMF added.\n\nIt also noted that access to RST financing would be determined case-by-case, based on the strength of reforms and debt sustainability considerations, and was expected to be capped at 150 percent of IMF quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is smaller.\n\nIn addition, RST lending would be part of a broader financing strategy members would pursue to address the longer-term balance of payments risks, involving a mix of multilateral, bilateral official, and private financing.\n\nIt, however, called for collaboration from economically stronger IMF members willing to provide resources to help with long term sustainability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe RST will support such a collaborative effort. We will build on our experience of working with the World Bank and other international institutions and regional development banks, complementing their lending to provide the best support to member countries,\u201d IMF stated.\n\n\u201cThe success of the new Trust will depend equally on economically stronger IMF members providing meaningful resources to help countries improve long-term resilience and sustainability; borrowers willing to go the extra mile to achieve the macroeconomic environment and reform framework conducive to improving the balance of payments stability.\u201d",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is not a win for the government or citizens",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is its government\u2019s most recent effort to control social media. While experts tell us that this is a failed attempt at the project, they warn that the deal will definitely have a bearing on internet freedom in the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government banned Twitter for 7 months and only lifted the ban last week after it claimed Twitter has agreed to certain terms. The social media company has, reportedly, agreed to register as a legal entity in Nigeria, pay taxes, and cooperate with Nigeria, through the Partner Support and Enforcement Portal, to regulate harmful content.\n\nTomiwa Ilori, an internet freedom researcher, says the Twitter ban sets a very bad precedent for internet freedom in the country, and if freedom of information requests and lawsuits seeking to get accurate, official, and economic explanations for the government\u2019s actions are not filed now, \u201cwe might have opened up the online right of Nigerians to express [themselves only according] to the whims of politicians.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, like in other parts of Africa, laws made by the government to regulate violent, harmful, and fake speech are used to stifle legitimate online speech.\n\nWhile explaining that he isn\u2019t aware of the exact law that the government relied on for the Twitter ban, Ilori said the Nigerian Communications Act\u2019s (NCA) long history of being weaponised to block access to internet websites makes it a prime suspect. \u201cMy guess is that they used the provisions of sections 146 and 148 of the NCA to get the telcos to block access to Twitter, as they have done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne major issue with these NCA provisions is that the government gets to decide what is in the public interest or is an emergency, as the basis of their request to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). There is no judicial review, human rights impact assessment of proposed actions before and after such requests, or public access to requests made to the internet service providers (ISPs) by the NCC. It is also important to note that ISPs do not push back or carry out necessary assessments before compliance.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban is not a win for Nigerians\n\nIlori explained that the lifting of the ban means that Nigerians need to start thinking about terms of legal reforms for online expression in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think the portal could be a great avenue for bridging sides. Having a dedicated means of reporting speech capable of causing violence and harm by proximate actors could help forestall violence. But who are these actors? I ask, because Twitter and the government should not be the only ones determining the nature and type of expression that Nigerians are allowed to share,\u201d Ilori says.\n\nIlori believes that there is a need to expand the content governance arrangement to include civil society actors, experts, and activists.\n\nThe government memo which contained the terms of lifting the ban states that the Portal would serve as a channel for law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.\n\nHowever, Ilori thinks that the government\u2019s power in the agreement is secondary and the actual moderation of content would lie with Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not a win for the government either\n\nFor Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights group, the government didn\u2019t score any points with the Portal, as it has existed for a while now; it only looks like a win for the Nigerian government because it hasn\u2019t used it before.\n\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s Transparency Report\u2014a report that gives insights into information and removal requests from around the world, by country\u2014Nigeria has made zero removal requests and just 7 information requests, at the time of reporting. However, India has made 12,435 legal removal requests, 67 court orders, and 12,368 other legal demands, representing 6% of global removal requests. According to the report, Twitter complied with 12.4% of India\u2019s requests.\n\nIn February last year, India\u2019s government enacted a fresh social media rule that made social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others more accountable to legal requests. This law allows the government to tag content as \u201cunlawful\u201d while forcing messaging service providers to identify posters of specific messages.\n\nThis regulation has its origin in the Indian government\u2019s semisweet relationship with Twitter. The government asked Twitter to take down some content it alleged was spreading misinformation about farmers protesting agricultural reform. But, to the chagrin of the Indian government, Twitter partially complied and restored access to some of the accounts it had blocked \u201cin a manner that we believe was inconsistent with Indian law,\u201d Twitter wrote at the time.\n\nThis, Sesan said, was the reason the Nigerian government has repeatedly tried to enact social media bills. But failed. First came the Frivolous Petitions Bill, which seeks to prevent the spread of falsehood on social media, with jail time and a $10,000 fine. Like subsequent remakes of the bill, it was withdrawn, after 6 months of widespread public criticism.\n\n\u201cSocial media bills\u201d as they would later be called, have been resurrected, over the years, in the form of 2 other bills: the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill.\n\nBut Sesan says Nigeria\u2019s internet restriction tactics are miles behind India\u2019s because the latter drew up regulations; Twitter will only respond to legal requests backed by legislation. \u201cIndia drew up new laws on social media that were specific. Nigeria made similar demands, but there is no bill in parliament making that case.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

          "title": "Streaming vs cinemas: How Nollywood can thrive",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s over 100 million internet subscribers may not fit into the about 70 cinemas across the country or even be able to afford the average N1,243 movie ticket the cinema operators demand, but they do not have to miss the fun with the many streaming services now in existence.\n\nThere is, however, a bigger incentive pushing producers and investors in Nollywood toward streaming services \u2013 the promise of a global audience. Recent movies such as King of Boys: Return of the King, produced by Kemi Adetiba have ridden that wave to success. In 2021, the seven-episode series ranked seventh in the world on Netflix\u2019s global viewership board (a streaming platform).\n\nNevertheless, experts say there is a difference between popularity for a movie and becoming the most-grossing movie like Omo Ghetto: The Saga in 2021. The debate is that should the Funke Akindele comedy movie had ended up only on Netflix without making the rounds in cinema halls, it may never have raked in N640 million it recorded at the Box Office.\n\nSadly, Netflix does not release data on movie earnings; hence, one may never know just how much was realised from streaming the movie on that platform.\n\nAs alluring as the revenues from cinemas may be, they have a serious limitation in supply and capacity.\n\nAccording to a UNESCO report in late 2021, the number of cinema screens in Africa is at 1,653, which is one screen per 781,402 in population coverage, compared to the United States which has a total of 44,111 cinemas, which is 7,503 per screen.\n\nNigeria, the largest country in Africa, and Lagos being the home of the second biggest movie industry in the world, can only boast 237 screens as of November 2021. This amounts to population coverage of one screen per 843,881 people.\n\nWhile revenues from cinemas may be bigger than streaming at the moment they are only just recovering from a pandemic hit, going by data released by the Cinema Exhibitors Association of Nigeria (CEAN). The data found that the total weekend movie ticket sales rose by 100 percent to N2.4 billion ($5.4m) in 2021 from N1.2 billion in 2020. The figure however is a decline from the record in 2019 at N4.1 billion ($9.9m).\n\nOn the other hand, South Africa, the second-largest economy after Nigeria, has about 120 cinemas and was able to generate $18.8 million (N7.7bn) in weekly sales in 2021.\n\nFactors that affect cinema revenues and ticket sales are not far-fetched, according to experts. They include multiple taxations, low-income levels, inflationary forces, foreign exchange in terms of equipment import, quality content, among others.\n\nThese limitations have played a role in the popularity of streaming services. The emergence of streaming platforms such as Iroko TV, YouTube, Netflix, Showmax, Amazon Prime, Ndani TV, etc, is considered as the new era of movie production.\n\n\u201cNetflix is like one of the major investments that have actually put the industry out there. People from outside the continent of Africa can now watch content, view our stories, relate to how we tell our stories. It has also paved the way because filmmakers can now go directly to the audience in terms of telling stories,\u201d said Damilola Aleje, a creative producer in Nollywood.\n\nNetflix and Amazon Prime did not just thrust the industry into the global stage, they also have helped set the gold standard for movie making in Nigeria. Prior to their coming, hurriedly made movies proliferated the market and were marketed and distributed by traders in Alaba Market, Aba, and Upper Iweka in Anambra. But the streaming services have made quality production a must-have and now control how the distribution of the movies is run. Importantly, they brought competition to the market.\n\nRead also: Nigerian cinemas shed pandemic blues earn N2.4bn in 2021 ticket sales\n\n\u201cI think each platform is going to play their game and it\u2019s also going to get as much revenue as they are going to get. Streaming platforms are coming in hard. The competition is becoming stiffer. 2022 is streaming wars. It\u2019s not just one major player anymore. The players are now going to be distributed into different angles,\u201d Aleje said.\n\nNotwithstanding, old hands like Kunle Afolayan, the producer of hit movies like Citation, October 1, A Naija Christmas, and many others, believe the best revenue model for Nollywood is one in which streaming and cinema exist side-by-side irrespective of their differences.\n\nStreaming services face significant limitations in Nigeria, especially in the availability of internet infrastructure, the rising cost of living, and uncertainty in regulatory policies. Broadband penetration currently stands at 39.9 percent and streaming relies heavily on mobile broadband.\n\nThis means that the speed for videos is very low and quality may vary depending on the network service a user is using. For example, in areas where 4G is scarce, users may not be able to enjoy the streaming services. It would require huge investments in fiber-optic cable deployment to get the services across the entire country. It is estimated that Nigeria requires about 120,000km of fiber cables to achieve full internet service, as the country has a deficit of 80,000km.\n\nIn the absence of streaming services in major parts of the country, cinemas can fill the gap for movie lovers through community cinemas.",

          "text": "Ghana\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations campaign may have resulted in a humiliating end after losing to the fourth-smallest African nation, Comoros, yet the West African nation has unveiled plans to share in Nigeria\u2019s lunch by becoming sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first LNG importer in 2022.\n\nIn a period where Nigeria is having an ambitious plan to power its economy with gas by 2030, Ghana is planning to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) throughout West Africa, with its terminal at the port of Tema set to receive its maiden cargo in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nGhana, seen by many investors as the economic gateway to West Africa and one of the region\u2019s most stable democracies, is working with partners interested in building infrastructure to sell LNG to domestic users and those within the sub-region looking to boost power.\n\nThe project, which is operated via Ghana\u2019s Tema LNG terminal, is backed by Helios Investment Partners and Africa Infrastructure Investment Managers. It is also made up of a dedicated floating regasification vessel, a separate LNG storage vessel, and has the capacity to import 1.7 million mt/year of LNG.\n\nFor Ghana, the start of LNG imports is seen as a boost for developing its gas-fired power generation sector.\n\n\u201cGhana is one of the most politically stable countries in Africa, providing a peaceful and predictable operating environment as well as serving as a key point of entry into West Africa,\u201d Murega Mungai, trading desk manager at AZA Finance, a provider of cross-border payment solutions, said about the project.\n\nNana Akufo-Addo, the 77-year-old who has been Ghana\u2019s president since January 2017 and whose term of office ends in January 2025, has had a deliberate strategy in making a case for the country to have an energy hub that will be championed by Ghanaian diaspora, in demonstration of the government\u2019s determination to improve the economy.\n\nThe proposed energy hub would cover a proposed 20,000 acres in western Ghana and would include four 150,000 barrels per day refineries. The plan also calls for two jetties, storage facilities, and two petrochemical plants.\n\nThe price tag for the proposed hub has been set at a cool $60 billion and the plan calls for completion by 2030. Each refinery would cost $5.4 billion, Fitch Solutions has said.\n\nRisk consultant Pangea-Risk said last month that the inclusion of LNG in the energy mix was \u201ccritical\u201d for Ghana\u2019s growth and development, and would boost its clean energy transition with gas displacing heavier fuels.\n\n\u201cBy selecting gas as a transition fuel and connecting to the global LNG supply chain, Ghana has secured the first-mover advantage in the push for a greener future,\u201d it said.\n\nIn order to have legal backings, Ghana\u2019s parliament passed a bill establishing the Petroleum Hub Development Corp. (PHDC) in October 2020. The Ministry of Energy said it was in talks with three potential bidders on the first phase investment, which would require $12 billion.\n\nActive participants in this new drive are Ghanaian diaspora. In September 2018, Akufo-Addo launched a year-long initiative to commemorate \u201cthe 400th anniversary of the first recorded forced arrival of enslaved African people to the US\u201d and dubbed it the \u2018Year of the Return, Ghana 2019.\u2019\n\nIt resulted in an additional 237,000 visitors coming to Ghana in 2019 and an injection of $1.9 billion into the local economy, according to the Ghana Tourism Authority.\n\n\u201cPositive economic outlook driven by service sectors, telecoms, fast-moving consumer goods, and financial services tends to attract foreign investors. Its pro-business stance seeks to boost economic growth with the government focused on providing a better business environment for investors,\u201d Mungai said.\n\nWhile Nigeria, a country with about 210 million population, attracted FDI of $107.81 million in the first nine months of 2021, Ghana, a country with 32 million inhabitants secured $829.29 million in FDI inflows in the first six months of 2021.\n\n\u201cCompetition is free everywhere in the world, so Ghana is free to add more competition to the West African market. If Nigeria put the right kind of investment in infrastructure it can outpace any competition from any West African country,\u201d Victor Eromosele, the longest-serving former general manager finance of Nigeria LNG Limited said.\n\nRead also: Nigeria-Ghana bilateral trade commission\n\nExperts say Ghana\u2019s latest plot to become West Africa\u2019s gas hub is expected to test Nigeria\u2019s inability to develop and monetise some of its abundant gas reserves that would otherwise remain stranded or be flared.\n\nThe Tema LNG is expected to add to Ghana\u2019s own gas production and imports from Nigeria via the West African Gas Pipeline, a project that is capable of making gas a critical catalyst in Nigeria\u2019s economy but is currently rotting away costing about N54.4 billion, according to last audited report of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nHad this project been allowed to come on stream, some stakeholders say it would have served as a major contributor to Nigeria\u2019s economic development and put Nigeria at the forefront of Africa\u2019s gas production.\n\n\u201cBy delaying these projects Nigeria has lost a major opportunity over the years to kick-start a massive secondary industrialisation, which would have been more geographically dispersed, across the country, thereby creating much-needed jobs,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), said.\n\nAccording to Nwakwue, gas-based industries are very crucial to creating secondary industrialisation in any country.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs to improve the general ease of doing business; it remains very difficult for investors to come here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value gas brings\n\nWith 206.53 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of the natural gas reserve, Nigeria sits first as the largest gas producing nation in Africa and ninth globally, and produces 8 billion cubic feet of gas (bcf) daily, according to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the chief regulator of the industry.\n\nOf this 206.53tcf of gas, the Nigeria LNG Limited monetises well over 4bcf daily, hence the company\u2019s significant contribution to the nation\u2019s economy through dividend payments from foreign exchange earnings, foreign direct investments (FDIs), and immense local content and community impacts.\n\nSince it began operations in 1999, the company has paid to the government over $114 billion in revenues, $9 billion in taxes, $18 billion in dividends to the Federal Government, and $15 billion in feed gas purchase.\n\nThe NLNG Train 7 is currently under construction and is targeted to increase the company\u2019s gas supply capacity from the current 22mtpa to 30mtpa.\n\nThe company is also planning to increase supply to Nigeria\u2019s domestic market to 450,000mt per annum. It was previously supplying 250,000mt/year to the domestic market and exporting the balance of its output to Western markets.\n\nApart from Nigeria and Ghana, many major gas-producing countries are also embarking on new LNG projects to boost their capacity and compete in the market.\n\nFor instance, Qatar\u2019s ongoing LNG expansion project is 32mtpa and valued at $32 billion. The project aims to increase the LNG production capacity of the North gas field from 77mtpa to 100mtpa. The facility is billed to be operational by 2023.",

          "text": "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Nigeria\u2019s tax collection agency, has disclosed plans to focus more on generating revenues from the digital space as the country ramps up efforts to boost its low tax take.\n\nMuhammad Nami, executive chairman, FIRS, said this while speaking as the special guest at the Pedabo 2022 Annual Public Private Sector Engagement.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, the Service will give priority to the collection of taxes from the digital economy,\u201d Nami said.\n\nWith the amendment of Section 10 of the VAT Act by the Finance Act 2021, Nami said the FIRS will implement the published guidelines on the Simplified Compliance Regime on VAT for Non-Resident Suppliers to collect VAT on digital supply of services and intangibles to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Service has deployed a digital service interface, the Digital Economic Compliance (DEC) Tool, to facilitate the implementation of the Regime. The implementation of the DEC Tools will also assist the Service in determining entities that fall within the SEP threshold and relevant turnover generated from Nigeria. This tool will go live shortly,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, Nigeria only generates 7 percent in tax revenue, less than half of the frontier market average of 15 percent. Only a handful of tax eligible Nigerians are captured in the records thereby costing the government badly-needed non-oil revenue.\n\nNami however assured that efforts were ongoing to ensure that the Service achieved 100 percent automation of all its tax administration processes with the aim of blocking revenue leakages thereby revolutionising revenue generation in Nigeria.\n\nThe Service will also deploy technological tools in assessing entities that fall within the Significant Economic Presence (SEP) threshold and relevant turnover generated from Nigeria.\n\nThe FIRS in 2021 leveraged on the amendments to its Establishment Act to embark on a major infrastructure overhaul, focusing on the deployment of technology for the automation of its processes and procedures, thereby deploying its home-grown integrated tax administration system, TaxPro Max, according to Nami.\n\n\u201cThe Service will focus on compliance and enforcement strategies in 2022, by leveraging on intelligence, strategic data mining and analysis, to enhance audit and investigation functions and implementing the penalty regimes in accordance with the laws,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthe Service is poised to ensure prosecution of recalcitrant taxpayers in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by urging taxpayers, tax consultants, tax collection agents and other stakeholders in the tax system to partner the FIRS in 2022 to make taxation and tax revenue collection a pivot for economic growth and national development, stating that no society can grow without its citizens paying their taxes.\n\nRead also: The essentiality of trust and trust building for digital platforms in Nigeria\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement yesterday by Johannes Wojuola, the special assistant to Nami on media, he said the FIRS executive chairman in an address earlier had noted that in the 2021, the Service had leveraged the amendments to its Establishment Act to embark on \u201ca major infrastructure overhaul, focusing on the deployment of technology for the automation of its processes and procedures,\u201d thereby deploying its home-grown integrated tax administration system, TaxPro Max.\n\nAccording to Wojuola, the Service \u201cwill focus on compliance and enforcement strategies in 2022, by leveraging on intelligence, strategic data mining and analysis, to enhance audit and investigation functions and implement the penalty regimes in accordance with the laws,\u201d noting, \u201cthe Service is poised to ensure prosecution of recalcitrant taxpayers in 2022.\u201d",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

The campaign started as early as 7am with an estimated 12-kilometre road walk to publicly declare \u201cNo To Ritual Killings.\u201d\n\nThe various groups and stakeholders under the umbrella of the State Gender Response Initiative Team (GRIT) noted that though two cases of attempted ritual killings have so far been detected in the state, the state would no longer condone the mysterious killing of young girls.\n\nAmong the groups which participated in the 12 kilometer walk against ritual killings are the coordinator, Committee for Democracy and Environmental Dividends ( CODED ), Mr Keme Opia ,the chairman Collins Cocodia Foundation and special adviser , political to the state governor, High Chief Collins Cocodia, wife of the chairman of the State Traditional Rulers Council, HRM, Mrs Josephine Diette-Spiff, International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Women Wing of Christian Association of Nigeria, the chairman of the state chapter of the NUJ, Comrade Samuel Numonengi, Gloria Diri Foundation, Do foundation, Child Protection Network, Ethanrose Foundation, National Council of Women Society, Medical Women Association of Nigeria ( MWAN), Do Foundation international, Starrz Safety initiative and others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe women groups were armed with placards with inscription such as \u201csave the girl child from ritual killings\u201d, \u201cTogether we CAN\u201d, \u201cJoin GRIT to stop senseless killings\u201d, \u201cBayelsa is peaceful not for harvesting human parts\u201d, and \u201c Our girls ,our pride.\u201d\n\nMrs Diri, who expressed concern over the strange cases recorded and the alleged participation of young boys in aborted cases in the state, said the land of Bayelsa rejects such dastardly act and that by the peace walk, the stakeholders in the state reject such acts.\n\nShe also called on the mothers and the men to protect the girl child against such evil acts, \u201cFor everyone that enters the state, the gods of the lands and the security agents are watching.

Therefore, they seek secession for the actualisation of the state of Biafra\u201d Igboayaka revealed.\n\nHe said that a Nigerian president of Southeast ought to be a patriotic call for all right thinking members of the Nigerian society, to pave the way for a new Nigeria where tribalism will be buried with resurrection of national patriotism instead of ethnic patriotism.",

          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nWhen preparation unites with expectations and opportunity \u2013 results happen. For every feat, there must be diligent preparation and effort. Nothing takes shape in disarray, grumbling and victim complex. We, the Igbo, cannot sit by the Rivers of Babylon and lament our way to the presidency. We cannot have what we are not ready or prepared for.\n\nIf work had been put in by Igbo political leaders in the past six years \u2014 forging alliances and mobilising consciences \u2014 the right atmosphere would have been created for the zoning of the presidency to the south-east by the foremost political parties in 2023. The mood today says otherwise. The Igbo are not prepared for the presidency \u2014 even though deserving of it.\n\nI met with some of these leaders years ago. I shared my concerns about the self-relegation of the Igbo in national politics and suggested ways of generating a high-voltage flow for the realisation of the ever-elusive aspiration of presidency by the Igbo. I was discouraged by them. Well, I later found out their reason. Their interest was survivalist, and not about the Igbo.\n\nThese same people cry \u2018\u2019the Igbo are marginalised and Buhari is Fulanising Nigeria\u2019\u2019, but will work hysterically for another Fulani in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to emerge as president. The fact is if any of the political parties happens to cede the presidential ticket to the south-east, these Igbo political elites will still tarry with the same presidential aspirant from the north-east. That is survivalist politics \u2014 which negates the interest of the whole for that of the individual.\n\nThis brings me to the question. What did the PDP do to deserve the loyalty of the Igbo? What did the PDP do for the Igbo in 16 years when the party was in power? The Igbo have trudged with the PDP through thorns and thistles, yet have nothing to show for their years of blind loyalty. Absolutely nothing! I challenge anyone to list the infrastructural achievements of the PDP federal government in the southeast in 16 years.\n\nI have searched frantically but found nothing. The much-vaunted upgrading of Enugu airport to international standards under the PDP government was a hoax. The airport was only converted from a motor park to an aviation igloo. The Buhari administration later had to shut down the airport for repairs owing to the treacherous runway. The second Niger Bridge was only in the works on paper. But today, the bridge is nearing completion under an APC government that the Igbo do not fancy. Onitsha-Enugu expressway is also nearing completion as well as other projects by the federal government in the south-east.\n\nWhat did the PDP do to deserve the loyalty of the Igbo?\n\nIt is really mindboggling trying to situate the reason for the Igbo\u2019s love affair with the PDP. Some Igbo politicians today are racketing for inland ports in the southeast. They went on the accustomed refrain of nepotism when a dry port was established in Kaduna by the Buhari administration. But these people were in government years ago \u2013 for 16 years \u2014 what did they do for the south-east? Nothing!\n\nThe Igbo keep tailing the PDP through its floundering and wobbles. Even within the party, the south-east is henpecked. Yet, the Igbo sustain the romance.\n\nAs I said in the column: \u2018In 2003, south-east voted for Obasanjo against Ojukwu \u2013 why\u2019, the Igbo\u2019s love for the PDP even conquered Odumegwu Ojukwu. In the 2003 presidential election in which Ojukwu, the famed Igbo leader, vied, the south-east voted tremendously for his rival \u2013 Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP. In fact, Ojukwu\u2019s \u2018\u2019Igbo party\u2019\u2019, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) could not even win governorship elections in the south-east except in Anambra \u2014 the late politician\u2019s native home.\n\nIn Anambra, Obasanjo had 466,866 votes which represent 54 percent of the entire count while Ojukwu had 279,378 \u2013 34 percent of the total tally. In Abia, Obasanjo had 386,748 votes (51.7 percent) while Ojukwu had 260,899 votes (34.9 percent). In Ebonyi, Obasanjo had 752,823 votes (94.5 percent) but Ojukwu polled only 20,525 votes (02.6 percent) within the same range as Muhammadu Buhari who had 16,308 votes in the state.\n\nIn Enugu, Obasanjo had 897,721 votes (79.7 percent) while Ojukwu had 177,050 votes (15.7 percent). And in Imo, Obasanjo polled 656,861 votes (64.6 percent), but Ojukwu had 281,114 votes (27.7 percent). The late Igbo leader\u2019s second attempt in 2007 was also unsuccessful.\n\nObasanjo trounced Ojukwu on his own turf. How intriguing? Today and like in the past, the Igbo elite consort with the PDP for their own survival \u2013 and not for the advancement of the Igbo. The beneficiaries of the PDP years were the elite who had sizeable representations in government. The southeast\u2019s liaison with the PDP subsists, yet no commensurate dividends in terms of economic and infrastructural development for the region.\n\nThe south-east regaining its place means it must look beyond a solitary party. It must put itself in the thick of things. And to sit at the table, it must wrest itself from the enchantment of the PDP. It must forge new alliances \u2013 a new political and social concordat.\n\nI ask again, what did the PDP do to deserve the loyalty of the Igbo?\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.\n\nInstagram/Facebook/Twitter: @FredrickNwabufo",

          "text": "The United States is looking for ways to potentially accelerate delivery of Taiwan\u2019s next generation of new-build F-16 fighter jets, US officials said, bolstering the Taiwanese air force\u2019s ability to respond to what Washington and Taipei see as increasing intimidation by China\u2019s military.\n\nThe officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency that they have not yet come up with a solution on how to speed up delivery of Block 70 F-16s, manufactured by Lockheed Martin and equipped with new capabilities. The aircraft are currently slated to be delivered by the end of 2026.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s government has privately expressed its wish for a faster delivery to US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, a senior Taiwanese official said, as the self-ruled island\u2019s air force scrambles jets to intercept increasingly aggressive Chinese military flights.\n\nMore missions mean more wear-and-tear on Taiwan\u2019s aircraft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about risk assessment \u2026 and it\u2019s clear where the risks are,\u201d the Taiwanese official said, referring to tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait separating the island from mainland China. The F-16 is considered a highly manoeuvrable aircraft proven in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack.\n\nTaiwan is on track to field one of the largest F-16 fleets in Asia once it takes delivery of 66 new-build F-16 C/D Block 70 aircraft under an $8bn deal approved in 2019. It would bring the island\u2019s total number of F-16s, including older versions, to more than 200 by 2026.\n\nThe Block 70 aircraft are the newest F-16 configuration, with new avionics, a modernised cockpit and an improved engine, according to Lockheed Martin.\n\nA move to accelerate the aircraft delivery would be seen in Beijing in part through a political lens, according to Abraham Denmark, a former senior Pentagon official.\n\n\u201cIt is yet another clear signal of US determination to support Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend itself,\u201d added Denmark, now an analyst at the Washington-based Wilson Center think-tank.\n\nDespite lacking formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the US is the island\u2019s main international backer and arms supplier. That defence relationship angers China, which has ramped up military and diplomatic pressure against the island that it claims as \u201csacred\u201d Chinese territory.\n\nIn the face of Chinese pressure, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has prioritised modernising the armed forces, which are well-armed but dwarfed by China\u2019s military.\n\nLockheed Martin declined to comment on any potential future requests to change the production schedule, referring queries to the US government and Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry.\n\nTaiwan-JetThe missions to intercept Chinese aircraft are putting stress on Taiwan\u2019s air force, which last year had several mishaps, including three fatal crashes [File: Tyrone Siu/Reuters]\n\nThe US State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, declined to comment on any internal discussions about potential changes to the delivery timeline.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Air Force did not respond to questions on potential accelerated deliveries but told Reuters in a statement that the Taiwanese military\u2019s major weapon purchases are \u201crigorously planned in accordance with actual combat needs and planning schedules\u201d.\n\nThe US sale of F-16s to Taiwan was guided by US law and \u201cbased on an assessment of Taiwan\u2019s defence needs and the threat posed by (China), as has been the case for more than 40 years\u201d, a Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe missions to intercept Chinese aircraft are putting stress on Taiwan\u2019s air force, which last year had several mishaps, including three fatal crashes. Over time, fuel costs, pilot fatigue and wear and tear on Taiwanese aircraft will threaten the readiness of the island\u2019s air force if this pressure continues, Taiwanese and US military analysts said.\n\nLast March, a senior Taiwanese official said Taiwan\u2019s military had stopped intercepting every Chinese aircraft.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s air force last week suspended combat training for its entire F-16 fleet after a recently upgraded model of the fighter jet crashed into the sea in the latest of a series of accidents.\n\n\u201cThey (the Chinese) are wearing out their opponent without firing a shot,\u201d said Derek Grossman, a senior defence analyst at the RAND Corporation.\n\nIn 2020, Taiwan\u2019s air force scrambled jets at least 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft at a cost equivalent to US$905m.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Authorities in Burkina Faso\u2019s capital, Ouagadougou, have banned an anti-government protest planned for Saturday, two months after another rally turned violent.\n\nThe demonstration, called by a civil society movement called Sauvons le Burkina (Save Burkina), was prohibited for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d, Christian Charles Rouamba, municipal secretary, said in a letter on Thursday.\n\nThe same group had staged another banned protest in late November 2021 against the failure of President Roch Marc Christian Kabore\u2019s government to stop attacks by armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. Hundreds of demonstrators defied the ban to take to Ouagadougou\u2019s streets on November 27 and about a dozen people were injured in clashes with security forces.\n\nA separate demonstration also planned for Saturday in support of neighbouring Mali, whose military government is under sanctions imposed by the regional bloc the Economic Community of African States, was also banned.\n\nTwo officials of the Coalition of African Patriots-Burkina Faso, which had called the rally, were arrested on Thursday, the group said.\n\nBurkina Faso\u2019s government has come under sustained pressure over failures to stem the bloodshed of the brutal six-year conflict which has killed some 2,000 people, forced 1.4 million from their homes and spawned an immense humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe worsening security situation has led to street protests calling for Kabore to step down.\n\nFollowing waves of protests, Kabore last month replaced the entire government and named Lassina Zerbo as the country\u2019s new prime minister, the latest upheaval in a leadership shake-up that has included military top brass and heads of intelligence agencies.\n\nEarlier in January, Burkinabe authorities arrested eight soldiers, including a high-ranking commander, in connection with an alleged plot to \u201cdestabilise\u201d the country\u2019s institutions.",

          "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are to hold talks in Geneva later amid mounting fears that Russia could be about to invade Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday Mr Blinken warned Moscow of grave consequences if any of its forces crossed the border.\n\nRussia has 100,000 troops at the border, but denies planning to invade.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has issued demands to the West, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato.\n\nHe wants the Western defensive alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, which Moscow sees as its backyard.\n\nRussia seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine in 2014. Ever since, Ukraine\u2019s military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in areas near the border. The conflict has claimed 14,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes.\n\nThe summit between the top US and Russian diplomats follows moves by Mr Blinken to secure US allies\u2019 backing for sanctions against Moscow.\n\nAfter discussions in Berlin with British, French and German officials on Thursday, Mr Blinken said allowing a Russian incursion into Ukraine would \u201cdrag us all back to a much more dangerous and unstable time, when this continent, and this city, were divided in two\u2026 with the threat of all-out war hanging over everyone\u2019s heads\u201d.\n\nState Department officials have said that Mr Blinken will seek to offer Mr Lavrov a \u201cdiplomatic off-ramp\u201d to ease tensions.\n\nHis comments came after US President Joe Biden on Wednesday predicted that Russia \u201cwill move in\u201d on Ukraine and warned of a \u201cdisaster for Russia\u201d.\n\nBut he also appeared to suggest that a \u201cminor incursion\u201d could attract a weaker response from the US and its allies.\n\nThe message provoked a rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted: \u201cThere are no minor incursions. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.\u201d\n\nSpeaking alongside Mr Blinken, Germany\u2019s new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged immediate action against any Russian invasion and did not rule out imposing measures that \u201ccould have economic consequences for ourselves\u201d.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has also called on Mr Putin to \u201cdesist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake\u201d that would lead to terrible loss of life.\n\nIn a speech on Friday in Sydney, she urged Western powers to \u201cstep up\u201d and warned that autocratic nations were being \u201cemboldened in a way we haven\u2019t seen since the cold war\u201d.\n\nEarlier this week, Britain announced it was supplying Ukraine with extra troops for training and defensive weapons.\n\nMr Biden is facing increasing calls from across the US political spectrum to take pre-emptive action against Russia.\n\nSenior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has called for \u201csanctions against Putin now\u201d, while the Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has urged administration officials to begin \u201ca massive airlift of \u2026 lethal weapons\u201d to Ukrainian forces.\n\nOn Thursday the US also warned that Russian intelligence officers have been recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to step in as a provisional government and cooperate with an occupying Russian force in the event of an invasion.\n\nThe US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two current Ukrainian members of parliament and two former government officials accused of being part of the plot.\n\n\u201cRussia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,\u201d a Treasury Department spokesperson said.",

          "text": "Adele has postponed her entire Las Vegas residency, just 24 hours before the opening night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but my show ain\u2019t ready,\u201d the star told fans in a tearful update on Instagram.\n\n\u201cHalf my team have Covid and it\u2019s been impossible to finish the show,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cdelivery delays\u201d had also played havoc with her plans.\n\nShe was due to play the first of 24 concerts at the Caesars Palace\u2019s Colosseum on Friday.\n\nAnnounced late in November, the Weekends With Adele series was scheduled to have the singer performing two shows every weekend until April.\n\nTickets ranged from $85 (\u00a360) to $685 (\u00a3500), and Adele was forecast to make more than \u00a3500,000 per performance.\n\nThey would have been her first live concerts in five years. Along with two dates in London\u2019s Hyde Park this summer, they are the only shows she has announced to promote her blockbuster fourth album, 30.\n\nSpeaking on Instagram, Adele said she had been \u201cawake for 30 hours\u201d trying to rescue the production, but had simply \u201crun out of time\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been impossible to finish the show,\u201d she added. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what I have right now and I\u2019m gutted.\u201d\n\nAdele also apologised to fans who had already arrived to Las Vegas for the opening weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s last minute. I\u2019m so upset and I\u2019m really embarrassed and I\u2019m so sorry to everyone that\u2019s travelled again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to reschedule all the dates, we\u2019re on it right now. And I\u2019m going to finish my show. I want to to get it to where it\u2019s supposed to be [but] we\u2019ve been up against so much and it just ain\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\nMany fans have been supportive on social media \u2013 saying it was the right decision and wishing her and her team well.\n\nBut some are facing losing hundreds of dollars from flight and hotel bookings.\n\nGillian Rowland-Kain, 32, was already on her flight to Las Vegas from New York for Friday\u2019s opening night show when she found out about the cancellation via social media.\n\n\u201cI was furious that Adele waited so last minute to make this call,\u201d she said. \u201cI recognise it\u2019s not a call any artist wants to make but she would\u2019ve known yesterday that the show wouldn\u2019t be ready by tomorrow.\n\n\u201cHer lack of notice is astounding. I\u2019m angry and frustrated.\u201d\n\nMs Rowland-Kain, who is from Brooklyn and travelling to Vegas with her twin sister, added that while she recognised the impact of Covid, the last-minute cancellation felt \u201clike a slap in the face\u201d.\n\nJosh Chavis, from Kansas City, says his wife Heather paid almost $1,800 (\u00a31,300) for her hotel and flights to Vegas for a show this weekend.\n\nWhile Heather was on hold with the hotel company, Mr Chavis told the BBC she was disappointed \u2013 and even Adele announcing it a few days sooner \u201cwould have made all the difference\u201d in terms of refunds.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that things are hard for everyone, but this is a huge misstep on the part of both the performer and those responsible for putting the show together,\u201d he said.\n\nThe star was previously forced to cancel the final two dates of her previous tour, at Wembley Stadium in 2017 after damaging her vocal cords.\n\nWhile Adele has apparently been beset by production problems and illness within her crew, other Vegas shows have been running as normal.\n\nThree weeks ago, Katy Perry smoothly rolled out her own residency on the strip, to largely positive reviews.\n\nHer elaborate and playful production \u2013 which she has dubbed \u201cPerry Playland\u201d- includes oversized talking furniture, a giant red rocking horse, a dancing alarm clock and a bra that serves beer on tap.\n\nBillboard magazine described the two-hour show as \u201cpart fantasy, part hallucination and thoroughly high-camp\u201d, while the Las Vegas Review-Journal called it a \u201cglorious example of what an unbridled imagination can achieve\u201d.",
