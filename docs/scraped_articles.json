          "title": "Breast cancer spreads faster in men than women, affects older men more \u2013Physicians",
          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nBreast cancer in men is not as common as it is in women, it, however, spreads faster in men, health experts have said.\n\nThe experts also warned that despite the wide gap in the occurrence of breast cancer in men compared to women, men should also be alert to the health condition because it spreads faster in men.\n\nThey, however, noted that the condition is seen more among older men than young men.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in separate interviews, the experts, Professors Abiodun Afolayan and Emmanuel Ezeome, noted that there is no difference in the pathology of breast cancer in men and women.\n\nThey noted that just as women check their breasts for lumps, men, especially those from the age of 50 and above should also be alert to lumps in their breast and should ensure it is properly examined as soon as they notice it.\n\nThe experts, however, noted that though breast cancer in men is not common, it is more ravenous and does not depend on the size of the man\u2019s breast.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Afolayan, who is a Professor of Pathology in the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Ilorin, noted that there is a very wide gap in the occurrences of breast cancer in men compared to women, but stressed that in spite of the rarity of the cases in men, he has seen few cases of it.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare the ratio of breast cancer in males and females, it is very wide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very sure now but it\u2019s about 1 to 100. I think it\u2019s even more than that. So, when we talk about breast cancer, it is several hundred times more common in women than men.\n\n\u201cThat is why when we are talking about breast cancer, we make it clear that it also occurs in men so when men see lumps in their breast, they should not think it is a boil. They should seek medical attention,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that the size of the man\u2019s breast does not matter. \u201cIf you see a patient with breast cancer, you\u2019d still see the breast so flat so it is not because their breast is more voluminous than the average man\u2019s breast, no,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that breast cancer in men has the same features as breast cancer in women. Pointing out that if a man does not present early and cancer spreads, the man\u2019s breast may have to be cut off.\n\nOn his part, Ezeome, who is a Professor of Surgery, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, stated that breast cancer in men tends to eat through the body walls faster than in women.\n\nHe also pointed to the fact that due to the less occurrence of breast cancer in men, there are more drugs targeted at the treatment for breast cancer in men than there are for men.\n\n\u201cMen have less protruding breast so the breast cancer tends to eat through the breast fast and get to the body wall.\n\n\u201cBut because females have a larger breast, they develop it more but when they develop it, it takes longer time to get to the other surrounding tissues but in men, it easily eats through the breast tissue,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the treatment for breast cancer in men, Ezeome, who is also a Consultant Surgeon and the Director of the Oncology Centre, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, said the treatment for most men with breast cancer is breast removal.\n\nAccording to Afolayan and Ezeome, male breast cancer is mostly seen in older men, usually from age 50 and above.\n\nThe experts warned that the best way to manage breast cancer in men is through early detection.\n\nEzeome speaking said, \u201cIf men notice any change in their breast, they should see a doctor.\n\n\u201cPrincipally, when there\u2019s a lump or swelling in the breast which is what usually indicates male breast cancer, they should seek help.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, Afolayan said, \u201cEarly diagnosis is the best, that is what we are always advocating if the patient wants to escape the sledgehammer of death from breast cancer.\n\n\u201cEarly presentation, when it is very small and has not moved from that site but when they present late, the hope of surviving it is very thin.\n\n\u201cThe patient can only enjoy palliative care and is given medication for pain relief. Palliative care is just to enable them to enjoy life a little. It is not easy to be alive with pain.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I always say that just like in women, the moment men notice a lump, especially painless lump, they should see a physician.\n\n\u201cThey can just be checking the breast from time to time. Once they notice a small lump they should go and report.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait, don\u2019t say \u2018it\u2019s a boil\u2019, you\u2019d buy antibiotics and drugs from the chemist. No, it normally presents with a painless small lump in the breast and from there it continues to ulcerate.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Impacts 850, 000 smallholder farmers\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nAs Nigerians agonize under the heavy burden of high cost of food, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, AATF, yesterday, disclosed that farmers in Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia have benefited from its mechanized 65, 300 hectares of land in five years.\n\nThis was made known by the Executive Director, AATF, Dr Canisius Kanangire, in a presentation at the 2021 Food, Agriculture, Natural Resources Policy Analysis Network, FANRPAN, Policy Dialogue held in Nairobi, Kenya, entitled: Technologies to Improve Supply of Diverse, Safe and Nutritious Food across the Value Chains.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pig farmers also want grazing routes created\n\nAccording to Kanangire farmers who embraced mechanization of agricultural activities on their farms under its Cassava Mechanization and Agro-Processing Project, CAMAP, up-scaled their harvests from seven to nine metric tonnes per hectare to over 25 metric tonnes per hectare, which is an increase of over 200 per cent.\n\nHe also made it known that following increased harvest there is also increased profit running into five-fold- $350 per ha to over $1,800 per hectares based on quality tubers, increased yields coupled with better market linkages.\n\nHe added that the Foundation is resilient in the vanguard of mechanized farming activities including agro-processing through CAMAP and AgriDrive.\n\nFANRPAN Policy Dialogue is an annual event that brings Governments and other agricultural policy stakeholders together on agricultural transformation in Africa.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt AATF, we continue to witness the transformative power of technologies when placed in the hands of small-holder farmers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThrough the Water Efficient Maize for Africa, WEMA, initiative driven by AATF, over 120 climate-smart drought-tolerant and insect-resistant maize varieties have been released. These varieties are suited to different agro-ecological zones and with the potential to increase maize yields by 40-60 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe CAMAP Project managed to bring over 65,300 hectares under mechanization within five years in Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia, benefitting over 850,000 smallholder farmers, majority of them women and youth who usually provide labor for cassava production.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that, \u201cAATF and partners in Nigeria, released the Pod Borer Resistant Cowpea variety, the first GM food crop to be released for cultivation outside South Africa. The product is resistant to the pest called Maruca pod borer which has the potential to reduce production by up to 80 percent.\n\n\u201cCowpea production is expected to increase through the control of Maruca Pod Borer. The benefits derived from the product include bumper harvests, higher incomes, and improved nutrition and health through reduced use of harmful insecticides. Farmers will now be assured of better health \u2013 especially regarding lower use of chemicals from eight sprays to only two.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he reiterated that AATF\u2019s continued support to engage in the annual FANRPAN Policy Dialogue, as a platform and space to share lessons on the role of agricultural technology and also engage with the policy and decision makers on the modalities for implementation.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Monday advocated an upward review to 42 per cent of the revenue accruing to states from the Federation Account.\n\nSanwo-Olu said that an upward review to 42 per cent would enable the states to cater for their rising responsibilities.\n\nSanwo-Olu made the call at a two-day South-West Zonal public hearing on Review of Allocation formula by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMADC).\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the two-day event, held at Victoria Island, Lagos, had in attendance all the representatives of the South-West states.\n\nUnder the current revenue sharing formula, the Federal Government takes 52.68 per cent, the states 26.72 per cent and the local governments, 20.60 per cent, with 13 per cent derivation revenue going to the oil-producing states.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated that the present revenue sharing formula among the tiers of government which became operational about 29 years ago was long overdue for amendment.\n\n\u201cNigerian fiscal federalism should be adjusted to develop more expenditure responsibilities with appropriate revenue allocation to lower levels of government.\n\n\u201cSo that federal government will focus on matters of national concern like security and defense, among others.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government proposed revenue allocation formula: Federal government: 34 per cent, State government 42 per cent, local government councils: 23 per cent and Lagos State (Special Status, 1 per cent).\n\n\u201cThe solution is to diversify and strengthen the fiscal base of the state government.\n\n\u201cThe need to reverse the age-long fiscal dominance by the federal government in order to re-establish a true federal system is strongly recommended.\n\nALSO READ: Court rejects Ndume\u2019s plea to withdraw as Maina\u2019s surety\n\n\u201cIt is the state\u2019s position that state government should be granted the highest share of 42 per cent, while the share of the Local government be increased to 23 per cent since both tiers of government are closer to the people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor pointed out that there was a need for effective fiscal laws that would ensure a framework for beneficial and dynamic intergovernmental fiscal relations.\n\n\u201cThis will help in nurturing strong, transparent, efficient and independent fiscal institutions that will also help in nurturing strong transparent, efficient and independent fiscal institutions.\n\n\u201cThis will further ensure accountability and proactively address emerging fiscal challenge in the public sector.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of Lagos State Government that State Governments should share 42 per cent of revenue accruing to the Federation Account.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the existing items on the concurrent legislative list, the Federal and State government should collectively share the following responsibilities:\n\n\u201cRegulation of labour, mines and mineral, social security and statistical system (census, birth and death etc).\n\n\u201cGuidelines and basis for minimum education, business registration, price control, national parks, fishing and fisheries,\u201dhe said.\n\nSanwo-Olu added: \u201cIt is the position of Lagos State that state government should take 42 per cent from the Federation Account and handle the remaining items other than those specifically listed above.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Lagos State government that Local Government should take 23 per cent and collaborate with the state government in service delivery\n\n\u201cThe Derivation and Ecological fund should be de-centralised such that each federation unit will have access to its own reserve whenever the needs arise.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the 1 per cent allocated to the Federal Government in respect of the Derivation and Ecological Fund should be deducted from the Federal Government\u2019s share of Derivation and Ecological Fund will now stand at 1.72 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe proportion allocated to Stabilization Fund should be increased from 0.5 to 1 per cent. This amount should be deducted from the percentage hitherto allocated to special fund on the development of natural resources,\u201dhe said.\n\nSanwo-Olu also said that the Federal Government should take 34 per cent from the Federation Account and focus exclusively on defense, external affairs, international trade, currency and banking, exchange control and federal trunk roads.\n\n\u201cOthers are: shipping, elections, immigration, citizenship, nuclear energy, diplomatic and trade representatives, public debt of the federation, telecommunications, insurance, inter state aviation and railways, meteorology, maritime, shipping and navigation,\u201dhe said.\n\nThe Federal Commissioner, Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), Dr Adekunle Wright, said the two days brainstorming session on how to ensure equitable distribution of Nigeria\u2019s commonwealth would have positive impacts.\n\n\u201cLagos as much as we know in per square meter is the smallest in Nigeria, but highest in the number of people per square meter, all of these we are taking into consideration and take on board.\n\n\u201cThe revenue that Nigeria generates belong to Nigerians, the revenue acruable in Nigeria belong to all, so all of these things have been taking into consideration to ensure fairness.\n\n\u201cWe want Nigerians to give us a chance that we are going to do it in a manner that will be fair, equitable and just,\u201dhe said.\n\nSpeaking, Commissioner for Finance, Dr Rabiu Olowo, said the state was proposing the provision for Special Economic Status and a Review of Revenue Allocation in support of the state.\n\nAccording to him, It is very important that federal government review the revenue allocation formula of Lagos State because of the high rate of daily influx of population into the state.\n\n\u201cLagos State is the smallest in the country, but accommodate 10 per cent of the whole population.\n\n\u201cDue to the daily influx, there is need for federal support. Also the state is shouldering so many of the Federal responsibilities.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with current realities, it is very important that the federal government review the revenue allocation formula.\n\nHe noted that the current revenue allocation formula had not been reviewed in the last 29 years as opposed to the constitution which stated that it should be reviewed every 5 years\n\nHe, therefore, expressed appreciation to the Revenue Mobilization and Allocation Fiscal Commission for making it necessary for the discourse on the review to take place.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is an aligned position by all stakeholders that the revenue allocation formula should be reviewed in support of the state and local government.\n\n\u201cThis is because they are the closest government to the people.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A group under the auspices of Nigerian Feminist Forum (NFF) has demanded compensation from the state government for continuous demolition of personal houses, malls and shops without due process and compensation, after collecting levies, taxes, and instituting compulsory payments.\n\nThe group said the conflicting government policies had rendered many people homeless and without a steady source of livelihood, even as some have taken to crime and criminality.\n\nThe NFF Focal Person, Ms Chinonso Okechukwu stated this on Monday in a communique made available to DAILY POST in Owerri, Imo State capital shortly after a one-day town hall meeting with zonal stakeholders and the ministry of gender and vulnerable groups.\n\nThe women group also gave an insight on the dangers of rising insecurity and extra-judicial killings in the state and advocated for sustained efforts to check the trend.\n\nA copy of the communique, which was obtained by our correspondent, read in part, \u201cThis has further resulted in displacement of people like commercial tricycle operators, food vendors, small business owners amongst others and a surge in violence against women and girls (VAWG), drug abuse, cultism, and insecurity. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe NFF believes that leaving women out of peace and security processes has hindered communities from finding long-lasting peace. In times of conflict, women\u2019s vulnerabilities and unique needs are often forgotten during negotiations, which limit the effectiveness of both peace and security agreements, and humanitarian responses in eventuality. \u201d\n\nThe group observed that Imo State and southeast have come under heavy attacks and insurgency since the outbreak of covid-19 and invasion of the Owerri Correctional Centre. \u201d\n\nIt also expressed the need for the signing of VAPP bill to protect people and provide a legal instrument for the prosecution of peace breaches. Human rights violation, teenage pregnancy, rape, gender-based violence, are high during conflict periods.\n\n\u201cWhen women are part of peace process, they know and include real victims of violence, conflict, and insecurity in the compensation process. \u201cThe release stated.\n\nSpeaking earlier Blessing Azubuike, Director of Gender in the Ministry of Women Affairs and Vulnerable Groups, advocated for women involvement in peace and security processes, and the measures that can create spaces for women in peace building.\n\nShe said every country is expected to develop a national action plan towards the implementation of the UNSCR 1325 while states are obliged to further develop a State Action Plan (SAP) aimed at localising UNSCR 1325.\n\nRecall that DAILY POST had earlier reported that hundreds of artisans and merchants at Perry Nwanguma, round 40-40 Junction, Control l and new Owerri, the Imo State capital, watched helplessly on as officers of the Owerri Capital Improvement Authority (OCDA) demolished many retailers and enterprise centres within the space.\n\nThe merchants and different artisans working within the space counted their losses shortly after bulldozers turned their items, shops into rubble around 8am yesterday.\n\n\u2014",

          "text": "*Operation to target militants, bandits, armed robbers, others\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nThe 81 Division of the Nigerian Army on Monday launched Operation Still Waters, a joint operation aimed at combating kidnapping, armed robbery, banditry and other crimes within Lagos and Ogun States which are its Areas of Responsibility (AOR).\n\nAt the launch in Lagos, troops deployed for the exercise were charged to be ruthless with criminals disturbing the peace and security of both states.\n\nHowever, they were mandated to respect the rights of law abiding citizens and adhere to the rules of engagement guiding the field exercise.\n\nAccording to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division, Major General Lawrence Fejokwu, residents of both states should expect increased military presence both during the day and at night till December 23 when the exercise would be concluded.\n\nHe said during Operation Still Waters, formerly codenamed Exercise Crocodile Smile, troops were expected to practice what they had learnt in the classrooms to better prepare them on how to tackle criminal elements.\n\nFejokwu said: \u201cWe have rules of engagement therefore, lawful citizens have nothing to fear but if we find criminals in the course of conducting the exercise, we will deal with them accordingly.\n\n\u201cThere would be increased military movement by day and night and I urge law abiding citizens to go about their business without any fear.\n\n\u201cAll we are trying to do is to work in synergy, carryout rehearsals and be sure of what we want to do so that when we have to conduct raids in the future such as cordon and search operations, all services will be on the same page and we will do it together the way it should be done because we have rehearsed it and because we know what each service ought to do in any given situation.\n\n\u201cIf we also have the security agencies on the street conducting exercises it would go a long way at deterring criminal activities in our society.\n\n\u201cWe expect hightened security awareness and that citizens in the course of this exercise can report any case to the nearest field location which are evenly distributed in the state. We are using our gun boats to patrol the waterways and deploying our own soldiers on the banks of so many jetties.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Commander 9 Brigade, Brigadier General Lander Saraso said the participating troops have been briefed to be friendly, civil with law abiding civilians but deal ruthlessly with criminals terrorising the society, within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe said the exercise would practice the troops in certain aspects of counter terrorism/counter insurgency operations in the states, adding that its headquarters was sited at the Digital Bridge Institute, Oshodi, because it was close to some identified flash points such as Oshodi Isale.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is designed to curtail the activities of militants, bandits armed robbers, cultists, hoodlums, illegal oil bunkers and the likes within Lagos and environs.\n\n\u201cRecent intelligence report available revealed unprecedented wave of criminalities going on within our environs with criminal elements who have taken over some communities to perpetuate their criminal acts.\n\n\u201cIn spite of efforts of security agencies, these criminal elements have continued to engage in criminal activities such as kidnapping, armed banditry, militancy, cultism and other violent criminalities within the city of Lagos.\n\n\u201cIn view of these criminal activities and as it is customary in the Nigerian Army, the brigade was tasked to conduct this exercise to curtail these criminal activities in conjunction with other sister services and security agencies as we approach the yuletide season.\n\n\u201cThe concept of the exercise involves the physical deployment of troops in the field from where this troops are going to be dispatched from time to time to conduct real time patrols against criminal elements within the environment.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is intended to achieve the following objectives: To practice units and sub-units under command on the concept of forward operation bases and brigade headquarters in the field; test the unit and sub-unit commanders in battle procedure and decision making processes regarding deployment of weapons and assets in internal security operations.\n\n\u201cTest commanders and staff at the brigade level including combat support and combat service support elements in the act and conduct of logistical operations and combat support service procedures in internal security operations; test ability of troops on communication skills and communication security in an operational environment.\n\n\u201cTest unit and sub unit commanders aspect of counter terrorism and counter insurgency operation, and test unit and sub unit commanders on inter service core operation and cooperation with other sister agencies in military operations other than war\u2026\u201d he said.\n\nSaraso said the ability of unit and sub unit commanders to handle the press during internal operations would also be tested, adding that they would be exposed to the levels of service support available to them at the tactical level.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

And they are unapologetic to any vested interest or godfather.\n\nThe five PDP presidential hopefuls are the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; former Senate President and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Ayim; Oyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde; Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel and his Delta State counterpart, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nThese candidates have no blemish, nor have they been charged for corruption, which some analysts believe is a good thing that will give the PDP a clean start from all the corruption allegations its previous leaders faced in the hands of the All Progressives Congress when it took over from the PDP in 2015.\n\nShould the parties zone the tickets to the south as the mood of the nation suggests, a likely scenario is that the two major parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP \u2013 would have candidates like these to compete for the tickets in their respective parties.\n\nWith the presidency most likely coming south at least following PDP\u2019s decision last week to zone Chairmanship to the north, these frontrunners have begun to see themselves as potential candidates for the PDP ticket.\n\nFor instance, a match-up from the two parties could throw up Nyesom Wike of the PDP versus Kayode Fayemi of the APC or Nyesom Wike versus Yemi Osinbajo of the APC or any of the other potential candidates.\n\nUnfortunately however, a former Vice President and PDP presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, might have been blocked in the party going by feelers from the PDP race and will be most likely unable to form another party, with what is currently on the card.\n\nRelatedly, the APC might also field a southern candidate and whoever wins it, the seat goes south.\n\nAccording to a top figure in the PDP who does not want his name in print, \u201cThe point, is that PDP wants to choose one of its own from the south as a candidate. The north has indicated that it is not against power shift to south. So there is growing realisation that power will have to come to south.\n\nSince the zoning of the PDP chairmanship to north, there have been talks among PDP leaders for a southern candidate and many of them believed they didn\u2019t necessarily need a northern candidate to win the presidency.\n\nEven though that narrative was being pushed by Chief Raymond Dokpesi, and other interested parties, who had their eyes set on the big prize \u2013 the presidency and had increasingly seen themselves as candidates from the north.\n\nBut the eventual zoning of the chairmanship to the north, has technically changed the equation, and illuminated the chances of these five southerners from the PDP.\n\nNyesom Wike\n\nThe Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has since assuming office in 2015, established himself as a force to reckon with. Not only is he considered a major financier of the party, he has been dubbed as Mr. Project, owing to his record of performance as governor of the oil rich state.\n\nA major factor in the battle to have a southern president, Wike did everything humanly possible to push out his own man, Uche Secondus, who was PDP\u2019s national chairman until a Rivers court sacked him and paved the way for the current calculations in the party. Wike has proven himself worthy of the job, both in terms of politics and governance.\n\nUdom Emmanuel\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, has shown capacity since he took over from his predecessor and Minister for Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio. This even became evident after he \u2018parted ways\u2019 with Akpabio, who joined the ruling party, allegedly in search for \u2018security and staying power\u2019 in the run-up to the 2019 elections.\n\nWith a stellar record of performance and a good hold on the politics of his state, Emmanuel, a banker-turned politician, boasts the kind of scorecard required for the nation\u2019s top job. He is currently serving out his second term of eight years.\n\nAyim Pius Anyim\n\nOne of the most experienced horses from the southern hemisphere is Anyim Pius Anyim, a former Senate President and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation. He stands a good chance, from different vantage positions, including his network of friends across the country.\n\nHaving held key positions in both the executive and legislative arms of government, Anyim, a South-easterner, comes to the table with loads of experience, age, maturity and the temperament for the job. Besides, he was a major arrowhead for the Southern presidency and indeed, headed the group that insisted the chairmanship must be zoned to the north.\n\nIfeanyi Okowa\n\nA former senator, the Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has been under intense pressure to run for the presidency, even before the PDP eventually brightened the chances of southerners by pushing its chairmanship up north.\n\nAlthough he has been discreet and quiet about such pressure, he also comes to the table with combined experiences of both the legislature and the executive. Quiet and self-effacing, Okowa commands the mien and maturity to lead a nation in search of identity and unity of purpose. What more? His leadership in Delta also speaks for him.\n\nSeyi Makinde\n\nThe only PDP governor from the South-west, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has acquitted himself well in the politics of the party, thus clinching a place others have considered immutable in the scheme of things.\n\nHe was prominent in all of the scheming that culminated in the eventual zoning of the party\u2019s chairmanship, switching as regularly as possible to suit what best answered the yearning of the south.\n\nCuriously, Makinde is the only first time governor amongst those in this category of PDP frontrunner for the presidency. He has, however, invested enough in the machinations and extrapolations that have shored up the chances of the south and therefore, found him a spot in the 2023 equation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A YouTuber, Israel Balogun who runs the Wholeness Africa Initiatives channel, has alleged death threats to his life by members of the Omega Fire Ministries led by Apostle Johnson Suleman over a 'Miracle Money' scandal.\n\nIn one of his videos on YouTube, Balogun analysed and condemned a video from two of the programmes of the church, one in Atlanta, USA, titled, 'Impact 2021' which was held in July and a June 2021 programme, Holy Ghost Conference 2021 held in Auchi, Edo State Nigeria, tagged, 'Harvest of Miracle Money'.\n\nBalogun, in the video, that has generated controversies, had said there was nothing like miracle money but a planned scheme to make people believe angels were dropping money into their accounts.\n\nHe also alleged that the pastor and ministers of the church will use such tactics to take double of such amounts from church members who received the miracle money.\n\nThe video of the controversial programme shows Suleman saying, \"The Holy Ghost just whispered to me, I'm going to pray and make declarations, after that you will check your account.\u201d\n\nAnother voice said, \"Papa (a term used by church members for Suleman), there is a miracle alert here, she just got her alert of $1,000.\"\n\nSuleman said again, \"Miracle alert, as you get it, run here. Angels begin to put money in your account.\"\n\nIn his analysis that has now brought about threats, Balogun said, \"Apostle Suleman is destroying the gospel of God, why would a man begin by telling people there will be miracle money in their accounts, you are using the name of Christ to do Miracle or Magic?\n\n\u201cThis is not the gospel, this man stood in the midst of the people, in the church in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria asking people to bring out their phones and there would be miracle money in their account. You must not fold your arms and allow such a thing to continue, Nigerian Christian leaders must dissociate themselves from something like this, they must tell the world that they are never part of the gospel that this man is preaching.\n\n\u201cThis is not Christ, this is not Christianity, this is voodoo, this is magic, this is not from God and it can never be from God. God does not deposit money in people's accounts, angels do not share money. It is either this guy has some people behind the scenes who have pre-collected people's bank details, who do not even know they wanted to use it for anything.\n\n\u201cThey might have asked people to fill some particular forms and asking them to make their bank details on that form and using that form to distribute the money at the time the programme was going on. These people are going to pay more for the money they collected, time will come when they will ask them to sow the seed and pay 'dangerous tithes', they will pay double of that money back to the ministry and this man (Suleman) is using this tactic. There is nothing like angels distributing money into people's accounts.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"This video is that of a man who has an arrangement with some guys, this is what they do behind the scenes. They would have collected information of people before now and so when the man starts the programme, the guys who want to do it have already programmed it, automated payments at the time the money will be released.\n\n\u201cAnd when the time comes, those people will pay in double because that trick will make them believe it is God and henceforth whatsoever the man of God tells them has to be obeyed, that is why I said the church must stand against that kind of practice and bring sanity back to Christianity.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up video, Balogun said he was being threatened for all he had said in the video. According to him, members of the Omega Fire Ministries have reached out to him, threatening to kill him and \u2019get rid of him'.\n\nHe said, \"After the video that I made analysing how Apostle Johnson Suleman did a 'Miracle Money' in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria, this year 2021, June and July, I have received countless calls, messages from his members telling me that they are coming after me, that I will get missing, they will make sure no one hears of me, that they have the power to send me to where I belong.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, one of them said and confirmed on his platform that he will let me hear the language that I understand and I think the last time such message was mentioned in my country, Nigeria, means that anyone who carries firearms will be shot or those called bandits shot on sight and I have never been part of bandits or to carry firearms, but the guy said I will be gotten rid of.\"\n\nBalogun also played a recording from the conversation he had with one Obi-West Utchaychukwu, a purported follower of Apostle Suleman who said, \"You are suffering, you are looking for followers, you have the guts to ridicule Apostle Suleman, wait I will send my photo to you, you will see my photo on WhatsApp, I travelled to Ukraine and I interview undercover.\n\n\u201cI have Adelaja, your mentor, on my palm and for me to kill you is a small thing and I will pick you up, I am already on your case. You are looking for followers that will subscribe to your channel. You want to use the man of God, you want to use Apostle Suleman for ridicule so that you will get traffic to your page, you are lying, I will get you, go and mark it, I will get you.\"\n\nBalogun continued, \"This call comes from a man who called himself Obi-West Utchaychukwu, he lives in Finland and he called me on WhatsApp threatening me that my life is about to come to an end because I spoke against the 'Money Miracle' of Apostle Johnson Suleman in Atlanta and not only that, many of the members of Omega Fire have come to my DM to threaten me, that they will shut me up, they said they know the address of my house, that they know where my wife works and where my family resides, they said they are coming for me.\n\n\u201cI am making this video to Nigerians and to anyone watching it right now, if I get missing, if nothing is being heard of my family, if anything happens whatsoever, know that these men are the ones behind it. They will say it, they will do it and this phrase of 'you will get missing is common to Omega Fire Ministries founder, Apostle Suleman because on many occasions people had issues with him and we have heard audio messages of him talking to someone that the person will not be found anymore.\n\n\u201cI don't know when I will get missing but I am calling on Nigerians and other well-to-do individuals, please do not let my death be in vain, because these men could be dangerous and whatever it is.\n\n\u201cI, Israel Balogun, will not stop talking until the day I get missing, I will keep talking about the messages that have polluted our pulpits that have turned our Christianity to paganism, I will continue to talk until mammon is dethroned, and Christ takes over his pulpit in Nigeria, I will continue to talk until you guys stop encouraging laziness and commanding money into people's accounts.\n\n\u201cGod himself designed the earth that until we till the ground, we can never make profit.

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has admitted that it was the Dunamis International Gospel Centre (Glory Dome), Abuja, which called for the arrest of five human rights activists who wore the #BuhariMustGo T-Shirts to its church service last Sunday.\n\nThis is just as the whereabouts of the activists remain unknown with the DSS and the Dunamis Church refusing to take responsibility for the arrest and detention of the activists.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the DSS and the church had first both denied arresting and detaining the human rights activists.\n\nThe worshippers were harassed and manhandled by the DSS officials and also denied food or sleep since Sunday in the DSS custody, SaharaReporters further learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt on Tuesday that the DSS had admitted that the Dunamis church called them to take away the \"suspects.\" See Also Christianity Whereabouts Of Six #BuhariMustGo Protesters Arrested In Dunamis Church Unknown As DSS Denies Involvement\n\n\u201cAbout 48 hours after illegal arrest and detention by Dunamis church, we don\u2019t know the whereabouts of these #BuhariMustGo activists,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe DSS has admitted that it was Pastor Enenche who called them.\n\nEarlier, the FCT command of the DSS as well as the headquarters had both denied being in custody of five activists arrested by Dunamis church security.\n\n\"At a meeting with Pastor Paul Enenche yesterday, the pastor told Omoyele Sowore and Deji Adeyanju that the five activists were with DSS. However, the DSS vehemently denied holding the five activists.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile no one has heard from the activists since Sunday when church security attacked them and detained them in the church premises. Their phones have since been switched off,\u201d a source revealed. See Also ACTIVISM How Abuja Department Of State Services Director Detained #BuhariMustGo Activists Arrested In Dunamis Church, Deprived Them Of Food\n\n\u201cTwo of them are said to be detained at the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad section of the state police command,\u201d another source stated.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Sunday reported that about ten activists went to the church on Sunday morning to worship at the church but some of them were surprisingly rounded up and arrested by the church security guards who later handed them over to the DSS operatives.\n\nFive of the activists were whisked away in a Hilux van and two powerbikes.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt on Tuesday that the state director of the DSS in the FCT was behind the detention of the activists.

          "text": "Presiding pastor of Livingspring Chapel International, Femi Emmanuel has taken a swipe at General Overseers of Megachurches in Nigeria for failing to mobilise members to join politics.\n\nSpeaking recently during a sermon, Emmanuel told the congregation to stop praying to God to deliver Nigeria as this prayer has already been answered.\n\nHe stated that the Christian community is required to arise en masse and utilise its huge population to control the political wards in the country rather than pray only.\n\nAccording to him, there are churches with 30, 000 and 40, 000 parishes in Nigeria alone and these can take charge of political wards across the country which is just 10, 000.\n\nHe described the current 1999 constitution as \u201ca fraud, a jihadist constitution, an oligarchy constitution\u201d which places everybody in the country under one tribe.\n\nThe cleric further said Nigeria is not a nation but rather a fusion of many nations forced to stay together with the help of a constitution which he said should be changed.\n\nHe, however, clarified that while he doesn't want the country to be divided, each autonomous unit should be allowed to rule its regions and control their resources.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have prayed enough, God has also answered our prayers. We will still be praying but the church of Nigeria has prayed and God has answered our prayers.\n\n\u201cYou ask me how? He answered our prayers by giving us large followership. Megachurches in Nigeria are not available anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cNo church like Redeemed, Winners, Mountain of Fire, Chosen, Christ Embassy, Deeper Life in the world. Redeemed alone has over 40, 000 parishes, Winners alone has over 30, 000. There are only 10, 000 wards in Nigeria where decisions of those who rule this country are made.\n\n\u201cIt's not just deliver Nigeria, deliver Nigeria, it should be God wake up your church. Talk to your General Overseers, the church community is an imprisoned community, our General Overseers have imprisoned us, they must release us, mobilise us, encourage us to go to the grassroots.\n\n\u201cI was in politics before, I have campaigned, been voted for, I was a deputy speaker of a state, I know how it works. It's not just prayers, we have prayed and God has answered our prayers. The answer is that he had given us people. Next to God's power is political power and political power is people-given, what else do we want him to do for us? Do you want God to come from heaven and be casting votes?\n\n\u201cThe seven excos in each ward determines who becomes president. We can't change Nigeria except we change the National Assembly. This evil law is called Constitution, this is the Jihadist constitution, this is an Oligarchy constitution, this is a constitution that puts the whole of the country under one tribe.\n\n\u201cThis constitution cannot allow you to go and it cannot change until you change the men at the national assembly, the men at the national assembly will not change until you select new people that will replace them so the church must wake up, not only church, patriotic Nigerians must wake up and you don't win on social media, you go to the grassroots.\n\n\u201cWe must attend ward meetings and put our good people there. It is people at the ward that are called delegates, delegates are the ones who will select who will be the president, governor, senator.\n\n\u201cIf you are not there and you sit on the fence, if you pray from now till tomorrow, it is a prayer in vain. The church must wake up.\n\n\u201cThis country must be restructured, was must go back to true federalism, Nigeria was a negotiated country, it is not one country, it is a country of many nations, how come one ethnic group dominates everybody? It will not happen again.\n\n\u201cThis year, God will deliver this country. Our constitution is a fraud, very unfair, very unkind, no equity, the whole of us will be under one ethnic group and if it was one that wanted progress, it would have been a different thing, these ones are repressing us.\n\n\u201cThat evil called Nigerian system will change. Let them come and arrest me, I will be saying it. Change your prayer mode from 'Lord save Nigeria' to 'Lord wake up Christians' there are only 10, 000 wards and I just mentioned some churches that have thousands of parishes, parishes that are docile, that are asleep, you are in the majority but you are asleep, minority us dominating you, changing the law.\n\n\u201cIn our church, we don't pray God should save Nigeria, Nigeria is not a nation, that's the first law we told ourselves, it is not one nation, this country is many nations tied together by force, we must agree how we want to be one, we are not saying we want to divide but let everyone rule himself at their own pace and let's meet at the centre.\n\n\u201cLet's be like USA, New York and New Jersey, they are side by side, yet they have different laws, constitution, policemen, that's what it should be, not someone dictating from Abuja and slowing down our education, economy, military and making Nigeria unsafe. This evil system die today!\n\n\u201cI don't know why God took me to politics 1990/91, what I saw in politics, I cannot see it from the pulpit, that's why I don't blame our daddies, they can't see it.\n\n\u201cPastors say: 'Let's pray' do you pray until they cut your neck, you pray until they abduct all your children? No, we have prayed enough, we'll still be praying, time for action. God opened my eyes and I know Nigerians will not be free until we send away these evil politicians, they must be replaced and our Constitution must be rewritten.\u201d",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax. Also, many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as hidden bank accounts and art. For politicians, these help them loot state resources.\n\nOther African countries featured\n\nUp to 10 Nigerian politicians are implicated in the Pandora Papers, including former Anambra State governor Peter Obi, according to findings from the leaked documents. Fellow major African oil producer, Angola, has nine politicians.\n\nFive Ivorian politicians and three Ghanaian public officials were helped by foreign agents to stash money suspected to be looted away.\n\nChad, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Congo Brazzaville have two politicians apiece, Gabon has three politicians while Mozambique has one.\n\n\u201cThese reports will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe,\u201d President Kenyatta\u2019s spokesperson, Kanze Dena Mararo, said in response to the ICIJ Pandora Papers leaks, without contesting the allegations.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Blockchain payments platform, Bitmama raises $350k pre-seed to expand product offerings",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, October 4, 2021, Bitmama is announcing a pre-seed raise of $350,000 as it looks to expand its product offerings into other African countries, grow its operational presence, and increase its team.\n\nThe round was led by San Francisco-based VC, Flori Ventures, with participation from Nigeria-based VCs, Emergence Capital and Fedha Capital, and a host of other Angels and VCs.\n\nThe Delaware and Neuss, Germany based startup, founded in 2019 by Ruth Iselema, has become one of the prominent crypto exchanges serving the Nigerian and Ghanian market.\n\nA few weeks ago, Iselema had a sit down with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2, as she gave insights into her journey and some exciting titbits along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, the startup has two primary offerings, the Bitmama exchange, which enables users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies \u2014 read Bitcoin, Ethereum, Celo, and six other cryptos \u2014 on the platform; and Changera, a cross-border payment product which it says allows users to \u201csend and receive money internationally, buy airtime or data for family and friends, pay utility bills for your loved ones from anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Nigerians were reported to have traded more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrency on local crypto exchanges \u2014 a number that is expected to grow in 2021.\n\nOver the past year, Africa has been regarded as one of the fastest-growing markets for crypto adoption globally. According to Chainalysis\u2019 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency report, countries like Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana rank in the top 20 in the world for crypto adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, Source: Chainalysis\n\nA fact which Chainalysis attributes to the high transaction volume in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading.\n\nIn countries like Kenya and Nigeria, where governments have banned cryptocurrency trading via banks, this holds particularly true. In Nigeria, Bitmama, like other local exchanges, rode the P2P wave in a bid to stay afloat of the ban early this year.\n\nInterestingly, Iselema tells Techpoint Africa that the round was closed in May 2021, and the company has gone on a hiring spree, growing the team while looking to expand into other African countries.\n\nAnd according to Akin Asalu, COO, Bitmama, \u201cSo, it\u2019s basically product development expansion into sub-Saharan markets, enhancing the products we have, and doubling down on them. For now, we don\u2019t see ourselves adding to them.\u201d\n\nAsalu joined the Bitmama team in May 2020 with previous founder experience at adtech startup, TaxiTV. The company enabled advertisers to target their audience on the go with partnerships with transport companies like Uber, GIGM, and ABC Transport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Bitmama has recorded more than $6 million in transaction volume this year, with over 15,000 users across its two offerings, a number which Iselema says keeps growing every day despite very little marketing by them. And all of whom Asalu says are active users.\n\nIn defining what he means by active users, Asalu explains that every single month, they\u2019ve seen each user perform transactions on the platform, whether buying and selling crypto or sending money to family members.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just covering all those verticals on the app itself and being able to say that okay at every single point in this month, we\u2019ve had each person do at least one transaction over the course of the month. So I\u2019ll pretty much beat my chest and say 100%,\u201d he concludes.\n\nAn interesting assertion, to say the least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitmama website\n\nBut apart from that is the issue of trust and building a suitable product for users. Asalu says the idea is to keep growing transaction volume while creating a product that fosters trust. Because in Iselema\u2019s words, \u201cPeople test, so you focus on making the platform work well.\u201d\n\nInitially, the idea was to bootstrap. Why? Iselema says she believed that as a Blockchain company, you might not need a lot of capital, but her outlook began to change.\n\n\u201cBut when we saw that we had to pay developers, pay a lot more bills, only your funds cannot sustain it, and maybe the profit is not coming in as fast as you want.\u201d\n\nEssentially, they needed to raise capital to accelerate growth and hire more technical talent to improve their product offerings.\n\nAlthough raising the money was not a walk in the park, it helped that quite a number of the investors were people already in their circle, so it was easy to begin the conversation.\n\nSpeaking on the investment, Maria Alegre, General Partner and Co-founder of Flori Ventures, says,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with Bitmama to help them in their growth journey. We are particularly interested in projects that explore universal basic income, community commerce, community currencies, natural-capital-backed currencies, accessible DeFi primitives, earnings platforms, peer-to-peer marketplaces.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s next?\n\nIselema says they are not looking to add to their product offerings. For now, instead, the focus is on expanding current products and adding new features. Perhaps why a lot of hiring occurred in the Engineering and Marketing departments.\n\nThere will also be expansion into some Francophone countries, Kenya, and Europe. A decision informed by the exorbitant cost to send and receive money despite digital advancement in recent years.\n\nOver the next few months, Iselema says the company will be looking to support the Blockchain ecosystem and developers via hackathons and opening up its wallet API to allow developers to build new products on it. For now, that would be accessible for free.\n\nThis will enable developers to create wallets for users based on Bitmama\u2019s wallet system. With this, they can store crypto or stake \u2014 locking crypto in a wallet to receive rewards.\n\nThe startup is also looking to launch a new product, Changera for businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangera\u2019s website\n\nCurrently, Changera allows individuals to send and receive money across the US, Africa, and Europe for as low as 2%; buy airtime or data, whether international or local; buy crypto on the Bitmama app using the Changera wallet, among other things.\n\nRemittances contribute a lot to sub-Saharan GDP. in the last few years, Nigeria has seen more in remittance inflow than it gets from the sale of oil. But, it\u2019s pretty expensive to send and receive money.\n\nOn average, a transaction of $200 could cost 8.02% in transfer fees. Compared to South Asia, where the number is 4.64%, that\u2019s almost double the rate.\n\nBut with this new product, businesses can send and receive money using their wallet, pay bills, pay employee salaries, and hold multi-currency accounts.\n\nUsers can also get a subscription-based virtual card which has limits on the amount allowed on the card \u2014 $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000.\n\nWith over 20 team members scattered worldwide, although Iselema says she cannot confirm if Bitmama is profitable, she says we should ask again at the Series A stage. A question we look forward to asking.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, education has evolved from self-education through self-directed play and exploration, acquiring a vast knowledge of plants and herbs for agricultural purposes to teaching certain expectations and behaviours to children.\n\nIn recent years, education has changed into a tool for children to learn and apply their talents or skills and for young people and adults to understand the competitive nature of the workforce.\n\nSimilarly, with the advancement of technology, students are no longer restricted to the four walls of a classroom to learn a new course, acquire a skill, or advance in a specific field of interest.\n\nGlobally, technology is rapidly transforming education. While edtech in Africa is moving slower due to power shortage and low Internet penetration, some African edtech startups like Ulesson, M-Lugha, FoondaMate, and Tuteria are helping Africans learn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an article by Ivan Kubicova for WorldRemit, a fintech company, Tuteria, a company that connects students with qualified tutors in their neighbourhood, is one of the few edtech startups changing education in Africa.\n\nIn addition, research by Brandon D. Faroa, a Psychology lecturer at the University of the Western Cape, shows that tutoring may be one of the most critical strategies for facilitating student engagement to achieve academic success.\n\nPlus, tutoring helps increase a child\u2019s motivation and attitude to reach their full learning potential.\n\nAs a result, Godwin Benson, CEO, and Abiola Oyeniyi, CTO, launched Tuteria, an edtech company, in 2014 to make learning accessible to learners who want to reach their learning potential.\n\nRecognising an opportunity and seizing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Abiola Oyeniyi, Godwin Benson\n\nBenson was hired in 2005 to tutor a child who was struggling with maths. However, payment was delayed after teaching, which troubled him greatly.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t his first time tutoring, as he did it alongside his studies as a Systems Engineering student at the University of Lagos, Lagos State. He met Oyeniyi in the university, where both finished with first-class honours from the same department.\n\nThat experience got him thinking, how could a seamless method ensuring payment for tutorial services be created?\n\n\u201cAfter Abiola (Oyeniyi) and I graduated, I realised this was still a persistent problem. Also, I noticed that parents often found it difficult to get qualified tutors who could actually deliver on their promise,\u201d he explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenson recognised a valuable opportunity in the education industry to create an innovative platform that would benefit both students and teachers, and he decided to seize it.\n\nIt would be nine years until Tuteria was launched.\n\n\u201cAs of 2005, Tuteria was just an idea in my head. I didn\u2019t know how to implement it because Abiola and I didn\u2019t have the resources until 2014,\u201d he says.\n\nMaking learning accessible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Val\u00e9ria Rodrigues Val\u00e9ria from Pixabay\n\nTuteria believes that everyone is a learner and that people are always eager to learn one thing or the other based on their interests. The company makes learning accessible to everyone in Nigeria, regardless of their level of education.\n\nThe company has tutors in all 36 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nTuteria explores learning beyond the classroom. It covers some subjects and courses taught in primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions, with tutors available for international exams such as the IELTS and GRE.\n\nAlso, the company covers skills and professions such as make-up, dance, photography, swimming, coding, music, and public speaking.\n\nTuteria makes learning more convenient for their learners. Essentially, lessons can be delivered at their preferred location, physical or online.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been very big on convenience for our learners; hence we make it easy for them to reach us and access our service. They can request for our services via phone call, WhatsApp, social media platforms, emails or just walking into our office in Lagos,\u201d Oyeniyi mentions.\n\nTuteria also ensures that tutors are assigned based on their proximity to the location of the learners.\n\n\u201cAll of our tutors go through rigorous verification and assessment processes, and only a small number of them are hired. They are about 20%,\u201d he reveals.\n\nThe company believes that background and security verifications and tutors\u2019 assessments are essential to ensure the learner\u2019s safety.\n\nChampioning convenience with Tuteria 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuteria homepage\n\nIn May 2021, Tuteria launched Tuteria 2.0, an upgraded version of its website, to continue to make \u201cthe learning process more seamless, effective and affordable.\u201d\n\nWith the upgraded version, parents or students can submit a request by describing what they are looking for in a tutor and providing information about their child or themselves.\n\nPre-assessment tests are also given to children in person after tutors have been assigned to determine problem areas.\n\nParents can give detailed descriptions of their child\u2019s learning needs. The algorithm will automatically generate tutors that have experience in that area.\n\nThey can filter tutors generated after placing a request based on their budget to get who works best for them. Each lesson features a progress report that parents can view and detailed follow-ups from their learning support staff regarding their child\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cWe also make certain that lessons are as convenient as possible for our students so that they can choose their own schedule and mode of instruction. With our platform\u2019s recent upgrades, they can also now optimise their request by budget and see tutors who fall within that range,\u201d Benson says.\n\nTuteria\u2019s pricing system is based on an hourly rate per student, with tutors free to set their rates for each subject. The upgraded platform helps users pay directly on the site and initiate contact with their selected tutor immediately.\n\n\u201cThere is no fixed fee. Every tutor on our platform determines their own fee. Furthermore, the number of days and hours spent learning determines the cost of learning. However, we take a 15% to 30% cut of the total cost, while the tutor earns between 70% to 85% of the fee, depending on their rating and experience,\u201d he clarifies.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the use of video courses and the convenience they bring as more Nigerians embrace digital learning,\u201d he adds.\n\nGrowth and expansion plans in a challenging economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuteria has over 3,000 tutors and has served over 50,000 learners since its inception. This includes academic and non-academic learners and qualified tutors in a wide range of subjects.\n\nThe majority of their funding comes from the revenue they generate. The startup has also raised money from a few private investors.\n\n\u201cWe receive over 500 tutor applications each month. However, we are unable to track the number of our learners because their requests vary across academic, exam preparation, skill acquisition, and other interests,\u201d Benson says.\n\n\u201cStill, we continue to record impressive growth every quarter, and we have several new and innovative products and services in the works we believe will contribute further to our growth, \u201dhe adds.\n\nHowever, the unstable economic situation of the country is a challenge for Tuteria.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the average Nigerian\u2019s purchasing power has steadily declined over the years. When someone is unable to afford as much as they once could, they look to cut as many expenses as they can, even if it means foregoing critical needs such as good academic tutoring for their children,\u201d he points out.\n\nNonetheless, the company claims to have addressed the issue by introducing a budget optimisation feature on its upgraded platform. This allows parents or learners to filter the estimated cost based on their budget and only see tutors who fall within that range.\n\nIn addition, Oyeniyi attributes the company\u2019s success to Tuteria\u2019s incredible team.\n\n\u201cThe team has been incredible. It is difficult to find dedicated people to work in a startup because it requires consistency and diligence, but we have been fortunate in that regard.\u201d\n\nTuteria intends to expand into other African countries as it grows.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we are looking to expand to Ghana. There is no similar service in Ghana. Most especially, there\u2019s a lot of potential for us there. We really don\u2019t have a specific launch date for Ghana now. It is part of future projections but nothing specific now. \u201d\n\nThe co-founders believe that the Nigerian edtech industry is exciting because it is young and has a lot of potential for Tuteria to thrive.\n\n\u201cTypically, the tech ecosystem has been skewed toward fintech, but it\u2019s great to see more attention being paid to edtech, especially given how much it helps solve the African continent\u2019s education disparity,\u201d Benson mentions.\n\nLikewise, the co-founders are confident that the edtech community will continue to produce innovative products and services, and they are eager to explore them to make learning more accessible to all Nigerians and Africans at large.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Startup BIll\n\nNigeria-Twitter negotiations\n\nZamfara\u2019s telecommunications blackout, again\n\nLagos Angel Network\u2019s new Board of Governors\n\nDid you join our Ask Us Anything session?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow of hands, who joined our Ask Us Anything session on Thursday, September 30, 2021?\n\nAll right, you can put your figurative hands down now. We had a lovely time answering your questions, and as part of the moderator duo, I can tell you that it was fun asking those questions. Never before heard stories, and some unplanned Google endorsements happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill we have more? Let\u2019s say there are several things in the pipeline, and you should be expecting a lot.\n\nP.S. If you didn\u2019t attend, I have this cliche phrase ready, \u201cYou missed!\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in a startup act?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nWhat do we know about startup acts? They are laws meant to create an enabling environment for high growth technology-enabled businesses \u2014 read startups. They aim to create a framework that helps solve problems around funding, infrastructure, and uncertain policies.\n\nSome backstory: To a large extent, startup acts evolved from small business acts, which were enacted to support Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Know what I find interesting? Only three countries \u2014 Italy, Argentina, and the Philippines \u2014 outside Africa have startup acts.\n\nBut what\u2019s going on in Africa? On the continent, only Tunisia and Senegal have enacted startup acts. Tunisia\u2019s 2018 Startup Act provides several incentives like salaries for founders in the first year, an eight-year tax break, among others.\n\nCurrently, in Nigeria, plans to present a startup bill are underway. The project is the brainchild of several notable persons in the tech ecosystem and is in collaboration with the federal government.\n\nIn August, we told you that the website for the startup bill was live and that a final draft is expected to be submitted to Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari in October \u2014 this month.\n\nFor a country like Nigeria, which has seen several seemingly destructive policies \u2014 the okada and cryptocurrency bans \u2014 and eye-raising government actions, this bill seems like a godsend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny news? For now, no. But while we wait, our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel, did a deep dive into the intricacies of startup acts, what we might see in the final draft of Nigeria\u2019s Startup BIll, and if it can save a tired tech ecosystem.\n\nRead this for a surprise: Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nWhat happens when Twitter says yes to Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, October 1, 2021, was Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day, and as usual, citizens woke up to the customary speech by President Buhari.\n\nIn his speech, he informed Nigerians that the Twitter ban would only be lifted if the social media platform succumbed to the government\u2019s three demands \u2014 a local office, an over-the-top (OTT) services licence, and tax payment.\n\nThe ban, which has lasted for four months, began in June after Twitter deleted a Tweet by Buhari because it violated the platform\u2019s policies.\n\nSince then, the government has set up a committee to preside over negotiations. More recently, in August, Lai Mohammed, Minister for Information and Culture, told Nigerians that the ban would be lifted in a matter of days.\n\nIn an email to The Verge on Friday, a Twitter spokesperson said that discussions with the Nigerian government had been \u201crespectful and productive\u201d and that the company continues to \u201cengage with the Nigerian government and we are committed to charting a path forward to the restoration of Twitter for everyone in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut what should Nigerians expect if Twitter agrees to the government\u2019s demands? Well, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, found some answers to this question and some others you might have.\n\nCheck them out here: #TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?\n\nAnother Zamfara telecommunications blackout update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems every Monday I keep bringing you some more news on the Zamfara blackout. This is the last one, I hope; but, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nOn Friday, October 1, 2021, Bello Matatwalle, Zamfara State\u2019s governor, ordered the restoration of telecommunications networks in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nZailani Baffa, the governor\u2019s spokesperson, announced this in a statement to reporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe restoration of the service at the state capital becomes imperative following the tremendous success recorded in the fight against banditry in the state and to ease the hardship faced by both the private and public sectors of the state,\u201d said Baffa.\n\nTremendous success? On Thursday, September 30, 2021, the Zamfara State government said it had arrested over 2000 bandits\u2019 informants since the blackout. This was said by Ibrahim Dosara, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information, at a press conference in Kaduna State.\n\nDosara also claims the bandits have been neutralised, with most resorting to eating raw food and millet and using camels to perpetrate violence.\n\n2000 bandits\u2019 informants? With Nigeria\u2019s famed history for unlawful arrests \u2014 look no farther than the #EndSars protests \u2014 I am a bit suspicious of that number. But quite apart from that, I am not entirely convinced of the effectiveness of the blackout.\n\nWhat happens when there\u2019s an emergency? How do you contact the police when there\u2019s been an attack? Will we see more blackouts like this in other states?\n\nAre you pondering what I\u2019m pondering? If you are, then you should be expecting a story in due course. Till then, do you have any thoughts on my questions? Please let me know in the comments.\n\nLagos Angel Network\u2019s new Board of Governors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos Angel Network\u2019s new Board of Governors.

One of the goals was to recapture our God-given position as the foremost sporting state in Nigeria and the custodian and pacesetter of all team sports in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also to create a platform and an opportunity for young girls all over Nigeria and Edo State in particular. It will enable them to build a career in football and develop their capacity so that they can become professional footballers.\n\n\u201cThe third objective is to create a world-class women\u2019s football tournament as a way of providing avenues to qualifying women teams across Nigeria; it will help to prepare them for the main season\u2019s games. This game is a pre-season tournament to provide our girls the opportunities to grow their talents better and acquire new skills and techniques.

This will help us discover new talents in order to get to the destination of becoming the number one state in all sports in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith this tournament, we will continuously push for the wellbeing of the girl-child and it will be our prime target, putting all the issues affecting them on the front burner.

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s Board of Directors has approved a $400 million credit to Nigeria in additional financing, from its International Development Association (IDA), for COVID-19 vaccine acquisition, the bank announced in a statement it issued on Friday, in Washington.\n\nThe bank said the fund is meant to provide upfront financing for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine acquisition and deployment within the country and that it would be implemented as part of the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Project.\n\nBuilding on the Federal Government\u2019s plan to break the chain of local transmission of COVID-19 and limit the spread of the virus, the original COVID-19 response program would be expanded to enable equitable access, the statement said.\n\nThis is in order to purchase affordable COVID-19 vaccines for 18 per cent, or about 40 million of Nigeria\u2019s population and support effective vaccine deployment to 50 per cent, about 110 million Nigerians.\n\nIt also said that the additional financing would allow Nigeria purchase and deploy COVID-19 vaccines, strengthen relevant health systems that are necessary for a successful deployment and to prepare for future health emergencies.\n\n\u201cCritically, it will permit the acquisition of vaccines to support Nigeria\u2019s objective of having access to vaccines under the right conditions of value-for-money, regulatory approvals, and delivery time, among other important features.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure that the government meets its plans to vaccinate 51 per cent of its population in two years.\u201d\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, said as the Nigerian government continues to tackle the effect of a third wave of the pandemic, it was crucial to continue to vaccinate citizens in addition to the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nThis, he said, was to avoid the dreadful consequences of another lockdown that left in its wake an economic toll the country was still grappling with.\n\n\u201cThis additional funding would ensure that the Nigerian government has the necessary financial resources to keep its vaccination drive going. This would mean that Nigerians will have increased access to the COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nMr Ayodeji Ajiboye, the World Bank Task Team Leader for the project, said recognising that there was currently an excess in demand for vaccines from both high-income and lower-income countries, the additional funds would let Nigeria acquire the vaccine at the earliest.\n\nHe said it would strengthen the capacity of all states and the Federal Capital Territory to deploy the vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt will also strengthen the country\u2019s health system interventions, such as enhancing health-emergency response capacity of health workers, cold chain equipment, disease surveillance, data management and use, and laboratory testing for the long-term.\u201d\n\nThe bank recalled that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it had deployed over $157 billion dollars to fight the health, economic and social impacts of the pandemic, the fastest and largest crisis response in its history.\n\nSimilarly, it also said that it was supporting over 50 low- and middle-income countries, more than half of which are in Africa, with the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and was making available $20 billion dollars in financing for that purpose until the end of 2022.\n\n(NAN)",

Hon. Engr. Omoreige Ogbeide-Ihama, alleging that he is compromised with the governor of Oyo state, Engr. Seyi Makinde.\n\nOlaoluwa said the chairman of the panel spoke to two of the leaders of the party in the state on Saturday 2nd October 2021 and informed them that Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State had directed him to change his panel\u2019s report and cancel the Osun State Ward Congress in its entirety, because the outcome of the Congress did not favour his friends in the state.\n\nAccording to him, Hon Omoreige suggested that the Leaders of the party in Osun should reach out to Governor Seyi Makinde to plead with him to redirect him, otherwise he would have no choice but to recommend the cancelation of the entire Osun State Ward Congress.\n\n\u201cWe make bold to assume that Hon Omoreige must have been induced financially to take directives from Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to cancel the entire Osun State PDP Ward Congress,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe PDP National Secretariat recently delegated a 5-man Ward Congress Committee with a Serving Senator as Chairman, along with over one hundred people from other states, who were posted to various wards to conduct the Ward Congress on Saturday 25th September 2021, which was very successful, and absolutely free of rancour and acrimony in all the wards across Osun State.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore very unfortunate that Hon Omoreige has displayed a Complete lack of integrity in the Performance of the Duty entrusted to him by the PDP National Secretariat.

Abdulkarim .B. Usman, in the welcome address he presented at the flag off ceremony at Igbariam, Anambra East Local Government Area, is apart from serving as an avenue to combat insecurity in Anambra State, and foster inter agency cooperation, it\u2019s also a routine training exercise in various geopolitical zones of Nigeria and South Eastern States.\n\nAccording to him, the rise of insecurity across the country has made it imperative that the Nigerian Army comes to the aid of civil authority in joint environment, adding that the exercise which commenced on October 4th to end on December 23rd, 2021, is meant to train command and staff of combat arms and services in planning and conduct of Military Operation Other Than War, MOOTW, to confront security challenges within their area of responsibility in conjunction with other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe military will use the golden opportunity in conjunction with other security agencies to curb the existing security threats in Anambra State. The threat ranges from secessionist agitations, by the Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB and Eastern Security Network (ESN),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOthers are banditry, kidnapping, cultist activities, land disputes clashes, communal clashes, chieftaincy issues clashes, assassinations and youths restiveness. To curb these countless security challenges, a robust posture in what the unit has always maintained\u201d\n\nCol. Usman thanked the troops and other security agencies for the tremendous effort in keeping Anambra State safe and secure, adding that more needs to be done to combat the highlighted security threats in the state.\n\nHe further disclosed that the Regiment under the leadership of Major General T. A Lagbaja is currently undergoing unprecedented changes. The Regiment and indeed 82 Division have continued to benefit immensely from the Chief of Army Staff, COAS transformational drive.\n\n\u201cRemarkable improvements have been recorded, particularly in the refurbishment of Armoured Fighting Vehicles, procurement of new platforms, upgrading of training facilities and construction of new accommodation for officers and soldiers among others.\n\n\u201cThese transformational efforts have greatly enhanced the welfare and operational capabilities of the troops. It is therefore my fervent hope that the exercise will record successes.\u201d\n\nHe urged all the sister security agencies and the people of Igbariam community to participate and cooperate with them for the success of the Exercise.\n\nThe Caretaker President General of Igbariam Community, Chief Anthony Obueh, who led elders of Igbariam community to the flag off ceremony, said that the presence of the Military in the community has given them confidence that there will be absolute peace and security in the state, the community and its environs.\n\nHe promised that they will give the military all the cooperation they need to make the exercise a success.\n\nSimilarly, the Army launched \u2018Operation Still Waters\u2019 to tackle kidnapping and other security challenges Southwest of the country.\n\nThe exercise, which began on Monday, would run through December in states under the 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, namely, Edo, Kwara, Ondo, Osun, Ekiti and Oyo.\n\nLaunching the exercise in Ibadan, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Gold Chibuishi, said the operation was \u201cto boost troops\u2019 ability to tackle the current security challenges in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMr Chibuishi said the army would collaborate with other security agencies to address the security challenges in the states under the division.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be based on real-time operation to checkmate criminality and strengthen civil/military relations between security and people of the states under the division areas of responsibility.\n\n\u201cOther operations currently being launched in other zones are Exercise Enduring Peace in the North Central and Exercise Golden Dawn in the South East and parts of South-South.\n\n\u201cThese exercises are expected to be conducted concurrently with other operations in the North East and North West,\u201d Mr Chibuishi said.\n\nIn his remark, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, represented by his Chief of Staff, Segun Ogunwuyi, urged the army to synergise with other security agencies and the public.\n\nThe state commissioner of police, Ngozi Onadeko and representatives of customs, NDLEA, air force, NSCDC, FRSC, among others, were present at the launch",

          "title": "Pandora papers: biggest leak of offshore data reveals financial secrets of rich, powerful",
          "text": "Biggest trove of secret deals and hidden assets of some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people, including some Nigerians, have been revealed in a investigative piece known as Pandora papers.\n\nThe cache includes 11.9m files from companies hired by wealthy clients to create offshore structures and trusts in tax havens such as Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, according to Guardian UK report.\n\nThey expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers and heads of state. They also shine a light on the secret finances of more than 300 other public officials such as government ministers, judges, mayors and military generals in more than 90 countries.\n\nThe files include disclosures about major donors to the Conservative party, raising difficult questions for Boris Johnson as his party meets for its annual conference.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars and business leaders. Many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as incognito bank accounts. There is even art ranging from looted Cambodian antiquities to paintings by Picasso and murals by Banksy.\n\nThe Pandora papers reveal the inner workings of what is a shadow financial world, providing a rare window into the hidden operations of a global offshore economy that enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and in some cases pay little or no tax.\n\nThere are emails, memos, incorporation records, share certificates, compliance reports and complex diagrams showing labyrinthine corporate structures. Often, they allow the true owners of opaque shell companies to be identified for the first time.\n\nThe files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington. It shared access to the leaked data with select media partners including the Guardian, BBC Panorama, Le Monde and the Washington Post. More than 600 journalists have sifted through the files as part of a massive global investigation.\n\nThe Pandora papers represent the latest \u2013 and largest in terms of data volume \u2013 in a series of major leaks of financial data that have convulsed the offshore world since 2013.\n\nSetting up or benefiting from offshore entities is not itself illegal, and in some cases people may have legitimate reasons, such as security, for doing so. But the secrecy offered by tax havens has at times proven attractive to tax evaders, fraudsters and money launderers, some of whom are exposed in the files.\n\nOther wealthy individuals and companies stash their assets offshore to avoid paying tax elsewhere, a legal activity estimated to cost governments billions in lost revenues.\n\nAfter more than 18 months analysing the data in the public interest, the Guardian and other media outlets will publish their findings over the coming days, beginning with revelations about the offshore financial affairs of some of the most powerful political leaders in the world.\n\nThey include the ruler of Jordan, King Abdullah II, who, leaked documents reveal, has amassed a secret $100m property empire spanning Malibu, Washington and London. The king declined to answer specific questions but said there would be nothing improper about him owning properties via offshore companies. Jordan appeared to have blocked the ICIJ website on Sunday, hours before the Pandora papers launched.\n\nThe Azerbaijan president, Ilham Aliyev, and his wife, Mehriban Aliyeva. The Aliyev family has traded close to \u00a3400m of UK property in recent years. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe files also show that Azerbaijan\u2019s ruling Aliyev family has traded close to \u00a3400m of UK property in recent years. One of their properties was sold to the Queen\u2019s crown estate, which is now looking into how it came to pay \u00a367m to a company that operated as a front for the family that runs a country routinely accused of corruption. The Aliyevs declined to comment.\n\nThe Pandora papers also threaten to cause political upsets for two European Union leaders. The prime minister of the Czech republic, Andrej Babi\u0161, who is up for election this week, is facing questions over why he used an offshore investment company to acquire a $22m chateau in the south of France. He too declined to comment.\n\nThe Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, is facing questions over why he used an offshore investment company to acquire a $22m chateau in the south of France. Photograph: Milan Kammermayer/EPA\n\nAnd in Cyprus, itself a controversial offshore centre, the president, Nicos Anastasiades, may be asked to explain why a law firm he founded was accused of hiding the assets of a controversial Russian billionaire behind fake company owners. The firm denies any wrongdoing, while the Cypriot president says he ceased having an active role in its affairs after becoming leader of the opposition in 1997.\n\nNot everyone named in the Pandora papers is accused of wrongdoing. The leaked files reveals that Tony and Cherie Blair saved \u00a3312,000 in property taxes when they purchased a London building partially owned by the family of a prominent Bahraini minister.\n\nThe former prime minister and his wife bought the \u00a36.5m office in Marylebone by acquiring a British Virgin Islands (BVI) offshore company. While the move was not illegal, and there is no evidence the Blairs proactively sought to avoid property taxes, the deal highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons.\n\nThe leaked records vividly illustrate the central coordinating role London plays in the murky offshore world. The UK capital is home to wealth managers, law firms, company formation agents and accountants. All exist to serve their ultra-rich clients. Many are foreign-born tycoons who enjoy \u201cnon-domicile\u201d status, which means they pay no tax on their overseas assets.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is also named in the leak. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was elected in 2019 on a pledge to clean up his country\u2019s notoriously corrupt and oligarch-influenced economy, is also named in the leak. During the campaign, Zelenskiy transferred his 25% stake in an offshore company to a close friend who now works as the president\u2019s top adviser, the files suggest. Zelenskiy declined to comment and it is unclear if he remains a beneficiary.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, whom the US suspects of having a secret fortune, does not appear in the files by name. But numerous close associates do, including his best friend from childhood \u2013 the late Petr Kolbin \u2013 whom critics have called a \u201cwallet\u201d for Putin\u2019s own wealth, and a woman the Russian leader was allegedly once romantically involved with. None responded to invitations to comment.\n\nThe Pandora papers also place a revealing spotlight on the offshore system itself. In a development likely to prove embarrassing for the US president, Joe Biden, who has pledged to lead efforts internationally to bring transparency to the global financial system, the US emerges from the leak as a leading tax haven. The files suggest the state of South Dakota, in particular, is sheltering billions of dollars in wealth linked to individuals previously accused of serious financial crimes.\n\nThe offshore trail also stretches from Africa to Latin America to Asia, and is likely to pose difficult questions for politicians across the world. In Pakistan, Moonis Elahi, a prominent minister in prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s government, contacted an offshore provider in Singapore about investing $33.7m.\n\nIn Kenya, the president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has portrayed himself as an enemy of corruption. In 2018, Kenyatta told the BBC: \u201cEvery public servant\u2019s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask: what is legitimate?\u201d\n\nHe will come under pressure to explain why he and his close relatives amassed more than $30m of offshore wealth, including property in London. Kenyatta did not respond to enquiries about whether his family wealth was declared to relevant authorities in Kenya.\n\nThe Pandora papers also reveal some of the unseen repercussions of previous offshore leaks, which spurred modest reforms in some parts of the world, such as the BVI, which now keeps a record of the real owners of companies registered there. However, the newly leaked data shows money shifting around offshore destinations, as wealthy clients and their advisers adjust to new realities.\n\nSome clients of Mossack Fonseca, the now defunct law firm at the heart of the 2016 Panama papers disclosures, simply transferred their companies to rival providers such as another global trust and corporate administrator with a major office in London, whose data is in the new trove of leaked files.\n\nAsked why he was migrating the new company, one customer wrote bluntly: \u201cBusiness decision to exit following the Panama papers.\u201d Another agent said the industry had always \u201cadapted\u201d to external pressure.\n\nSome leaked files appear to show some in the industry seeking to circumvent new privacy regulations. One Swiss lawyer refused to email the names of his high-value customers to a service provider in the BVI, following new legislation. Instead, he sent them by airmail, with strict instructions they should not be processed in any \u201celectronic way\u201d. The identity of another beneficial owner was shared via WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this way to proceed is to enable you to comply with BVI rules,\u201d the lawyer wrote. Referring to Mossack Fonseca, the lawyer added: \u201cYou are obliged to keep secrecy for our clients and to not make feasible at all a second \u2018Panama papers\u2019 story that happened to one of your competitors.\u201d\n\nGerard Ryle, the director of the ICIJ, said leading politicians who organised their finances in tax havens had a stake in the status quo, and were likely to be an obstacle to reform of the offshore economy. \u201cWhen you have world leaders, when you have politicians, when you have public officials, all using the secrecy and all using this world, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see an end to it.\u201d\n\nHe expected the Pandora papers to have a greater impact than previous leaks, not least because they were arriving in the middle of a pandemic that had exacerbated inequalities and forced governments to borrow unprecedented amounts to be shouldered by ordinary taxpayers. \u201cThis is the Panama papers on steroids,\u201d Ryle said. \u201cIt\u2019s broader, richer and has more detail.\u201d\n\nAt least $11.3tn in wealth is held offshore, according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \u201cThis is money that is being lost to treasuries around the world and money that could be used to recover from Covid,\u201d Ryle said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing out because some people are gaining. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s a very simple transaction that\u2019s going on here.\u201d\n\nPandora papers reporting team: Simon Goodley, Harry Davies, Luke Harding, Juliette Garside, David Conn, David Pegg, Paul Lewis, Caelainn Barr, Rowena Mason and Pamela Duncan in London; Ben Butler and Anne Davies in Sydney; Dominic Rushe in New York; Andrew Roth in Moscow; Helena Smith in Athens; Michael Safi in Lebanon; Robert Tait in Prague.\n\nGuardian",

So having considered them and see the position of the various congress, we decided to suspend the strike officially, starting from the 6th of October at 8:00 am. That was the position that was taken.\n\n\u201cWe decided to officially resume on Wednesday considering the fact that some of our members who travelled had to come back and with the insecurity in the country people are afraid to travel at night.\n\n\u201cSo to give them time to travel in the daytime and relay the information that we have suspended the strike, we decided it should be on Wednesday. Again, we were also trying to avoid some of them having problems with their immediate supervisors.\u201d\n\nAsked if all their demands have been met, Ishaya explained that not all their demands have been met, saying that, \u201cThat is why we say suspension because when we looked at the demands, there were points that have actually been significantly addressed and there were some that have been stalemated because the government was invoking the trade dispute act on us and those part that the government were invoking the trade dispute act which says that \u2018you shouldn\u2019t pay any remuneration to any employee who has engaged in any form of lockout or strike.\u201d\n\nThe NARD president disclosed that some of the minimal demands were difficult to achieve with the enforcement of \u2018no work, no pay,\u2019 adding that, \u201cOne of those was the fact we demanded that some of our members should be enrolled into IPPIs and their arrears of four to six months now be paid to them.\n\n\u201cThe government said they have enrolled them but they are not able to pay-rolled them because we are on strike. So they assumed a position that they cannot pay-rolled them because we are on strike and without being pay-rolled they cannot get their arrears.\u201d\n\nIshaya said the government insisted that since their migration to IPPIS, they have not received any salary to verify if they are really the owners of those accounts.\n\n\u201cSo we have to give a window so that their salaries will be paid in other to identify their accounts and their arrears will also be pushed into those accounts,\u201d he explained.",

He called on the federal government, EFCC, minister of health to help resolve the none payment of Salaries.\n\nHis words :\u201d We keep on engaging the management, but they say we are disturbing, we have worked and asked for our salary but they say we are disturbing that we are causing security threats.\n\n\u201cA memo was released on the 2nd of August , placing us on a one month suspension, to allow for the resolving of the issue. Up until now, nothing has been done.\n\n\u201cThey said we should write an apology letter, we have done so, yet No solution. The management is not sincere in this whole thing.\n\n\u201cWe are 352 ,we are owed over 480 Million naira and when you open up, they will call the security agency to come after you. we are being enslaved we call on the federal government, the EFCC, Minister of health, to please look into this issue.\u201d He said.\n\nAnother intern, Miss Nmuoeke Maurine said the reason their protest was because of our 11 months Salaries and over two months suspension that don\u2019t they don\u2019t even know when it would be called off.\n\n\u201cWe have not done anything to the management to attract this unfair treatment, none of us has received up to a month salary for the past 11 months.\n\n\u201cI guess the money should be available because other medical institutions are being paid. Our demand is that they should pay us our complete salary. We did not commit any crime asking for our money, let them lift the suspension. We have worked for our money.\u201d She said.\n\nWhile Shadrach Atheodor also told Vanguard that he was amongst those invited by DSS not to carry out the peaceful protest .\n\n\u201cWe are not here to fight or make problem, our emphasis Is that we should be paid. I was invited to the DSS Office yesterday,they told us not to do any peaceful protest, the DSS has tried their best but if the management did the needful, We won\u2019t be gathered here today.\n\n\u201cWe have written several memos to the CMD but he has not acknowledged any of the memos, he has refused to respond.

He called on the federal government, EFCC, minister of health to help resolve the none payment of Salaries.\n\nHis words :\u201d We keep on engaging the management, but they say we are disturbing, we have worked and asked for our salary but they say we are disturbing that we are causing security threats.\n\n\u201cA memo was released on the 2nd of August , placing us on a one month suspension, to allow for the resolving of the issue. Up until now, nothing has been done.\n\n\u201cThey said we should write an apology letter, we have done so, yet No solution. The management is not sincere in this whole thing.\n\n\u201cWe are 352 ,we are owed over 480 Million naira and when you open up, they will call the security agency to come after you. we are being enslaved we call on the federal government, the EFCC, Minister of health, to please look into this issue.\u201d He said.\n\nAnother intern, Miss Nmuoeke Maurine said the reason their protest was because of our 11 months Salaries and over two months suspension that don\u2019t they don\u2019t even know when it would be called off.\n\n\u201cWe have not done anything to the management to attract this unfair treatment, none of us has received up to a month salary for the past 11 months.\n\n\u201cI guess the money should be available because other medical institutions are being paid. Our demand is that they should pay us our complete salary. We did not commit any crime asking for our money, let them lift the suspension. We have worked for our money.\u201d She said.\n\nWhile Shadrach Atheodor also told Vanguard that he was amongst those invited by DSS not to carry out the peaceful protest .\n\n\u201cWe are not here to fight or make problem, our emphasis Is that we should be paid. I was invited to the DSS Office yesterday,they told us not to do any peaceful protest, the DSS has tried their best but if the management did the needful, We won\u2019t be gathered here today.\n\n\u201cWe have written several memos to the CMD but he has not acknowledged any of the memos, he has refused to respond. We are crying for our Salaries,\u201d he said. Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Grammy award-winning singer, Wizkid, has achieved another feat with his 2020 song, \u201cEssence\u201d, which features fast-rising Nigerian artiste, Tems. The song reached platinum status barely a month after it was certified gold in the US.\n\nAccording to the BRITS Certified Awards website, songs are awarded platinum status when they achieve 600,000 units of sales. The records are awarded the gold status for 400,000 units and silver for 200,000 units, but this would be based on Official Charts Company data.\n\nTems\u2019 manager, Muyiwa Awoniyi, shared a video on his Instagram story, where Tems and Wizkid were receiving the certification plaque. This comes after the duo performed \u201cEssence\u201d together for the first time on stage in the United States.\n\nWizkid told Tems, \u201cI love you, baby girl, you\u2019re a superstar. This is your time. This is your moment. This is your time and moment and the world needs to hear this because it is special to me.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201dWe have a Platinum record and I just want to say thank you to everyone involved in this from Tems to the producers, Legendary beats, these are my brothers from way back. I want to say we made a good beat.\n\n\u201dThanks to the whole team for believing in the dreams from early, to my fans I appreciate you all and I pray God blesses all of you.\u201d\n\nThe song becomes his second to be certified this year after his 2017 song, \u201cCome Closer\u201d, featuring Canadian rapper, Drake, was certified platinum and gold in the UK and Australia respectively in April.\n\nIn 2020, Wizkid became the first African artiste to be certified Gold in the United States, after 500,000 units of Come Closer were sold.\n\n\u201cEssence\u201d was released in October 2020 as the 11th song on Made in Lagos, Wizkid\u2019s fourth studio album.\n\nGarnering the attention of American stars such as Snoop Dogg and Kylie Jenner, \u201cEssence\u201d became popular with the American audience earlier this year.\n\nThe remixed version of the song featured Canadian pop star, Justin Bieber, who tagged it as, \u2018song of the summer.\u2019 Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Facebook and Instagram appeared reconnected to the global internet on Monday afternoon, nearly six hours into an outage that paralyzed the social media platform.\n\nIn an announcement on Twitter, Facebook apologised to its more than 1.5billion users worldwide.\n\n\u201cTo the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we\u2019re sorry. We\u2019ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us\u201d, it said.\n\nFacebook and its WhatsApp and Instagram apps went dark at around noon Eastern time, triggering a record 10.6 million problem reports, according to website monitoring group Downdetector.\n\nIt said the outage was the largest such failure it had ever seen.\n\nAround 5:45 pm ET, some Facebook users began to regain partial access to the social media app.\n\nWhatsApp continued to have connection problems for at least some people.\n\nThe outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.\n\nShares of Facebook, which has nearly 2 billion daily active users, opened lower after the whistleblower report and slipped further to trade down 5.3% in afternoon trading on Monday. They were on track for their worst day in nearly a year, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks.\n\nSecurity experts said the disruption could be the result of an internal mistake, though sabotage by an insider would be theoretically possible.\n\n\u201cFacebook basically locked its keys in its car,\u201d tweeted Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\n\nThe Independent of London explained what could have gone wrong:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s problems appeared to be related to the domain name system, or DNS. That is often referred to as the phone book of the internet, taking the URL a person types into their browser \u2013 such as Facebook.com \u2013 and turning it into a numerical address that can then be asked for the data that makes up the website being accessed.\n\n\u201cThe company runs its own DNS, unlike many other smaller firms. As such, it is at liberty to make changes itself \u2013 and to remove those records, too, which was what seemed to have happened at some point on Monday.\n\n\u201cWithout the correct DNS configurations, browsers were unable to access the Facebook website, and apps could not properly call the servers needed to fill up Instagram with new posts or WhatsApp with new messages.\n\n\u201cIn all, a vast array of Facebook of services went down. They included not just its large apps but virtual reality platform Oculus, and office social network Workplace\u201d.\n\nToday\u2019s outage is also not the worst or the longest in the company\u2019s history.\n\nIn 2019, that record was set by a technical issue that lasted for more than 24 hours, and about which Facebook was largely cryptic in its explanations.",

The wind was so forceful that it swept rain water into houses and shops and it even blew off roofs of houses.\u201d\n\nAnother resident Deborah Bamidele who spoke to this medium explained that the extent of the damage was not known until the rain subsided.\n\nIn her words, \u201cUntil we came out after the rainfall, we never knew the extent of the damage. Roofs were blown away. Shops were pulled down.\n\n\u201cThere is even a case of roof blown out and deposited on an electricity line. We were scared initially that it may affect power supply to our area but we were able to remove the roof from the affected power line without recording any mishap.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the community development associations, Adekunle Adeogun said residents have always surmounted the challenges brfough by such rainfall.\n\nAdeogun explained that after the rain, the youths in the community were mobilised to clear most of the debris as a result of the wind and were able to remove the roof that was blown onto the electricity line.\n\nHe also said the elders in the community had been up and doing but still needed government intervention as there was a limit to what they could achieve.\n\n\u201cWe still need government intervention in the area is locating a health centre, primary school and other in our community.\n\nWe have sent delegations and written several letters on these developments and on many occasions they have promised to intervene but no concrete action in ground yet.\n\n\u201cThe roads are had and with had drainage system in the community, whenever it rained, flooding is always a menace but we are lucky that we are on an elevated plain so flood water doesn\u2019t disturb most houses but our roads have been made worse for it.\u201d",

Biobelemoye Josiah, National Chairman, JOHESU which was addressed to Dr. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, said, it reached the decision for the postponement after due consultation of the National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nThe letter partly reads, \u201cWe find it imperative to intimate your office of the fundamental resolution adopted at the expanded NEC meeting of Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) and Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations (AHPA) which reviewed the ultimatum for a strike action expected to commence by midnight of Monday, October 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cAfter our usual very critical appraisal during consultations and meetings, the NEC resolved to put on hold the strike action. This decision was hinged on the forthcoming engagement with the Federal Government on Wednesday, October 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to avoid an endless circus show, the leadership of JOHESU needs to make it unambiguously clear that the meeting with the Federal Government on Wednesday, October 6, 2021, will be the ultimate litmus test to evaluate the seriousness of the Federal Government to resolve once and for all, the tortuous subject matter of adjustment of CONHESS which has lingered since January 2, 2014 (almost 8 years) now and also determine the depth of industrial harmony in the Health Sector.\n\n\u201cFinally, Honourable Minister, the JOHESU family appreciates some of the gains in our current negotiations but has resolved albeit very strongly, that the Federal Government must show more commitment in reasonable time to ward off the reality of a strike we have continued to maturely and consistently refuse to embrace in the public interest.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, necessary to encourage the Minister to catalyse the efforts of the Federal Government that is geared to permanently ameliorate the demands of JOHESU, particularly the High-Level Body.\n\n\u201cWe wish the Hon. Minister and other key players in the Federal Government team well as we tackle these seemingly unending challenges.\u201d",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "Dangote Cement has awarded multi-million naira educational scholarships to over 115 students, while training 30 others on skill acquisition in tailoring and fashion designing in 15 host communities of its Ibese cement plant in Ogun State.\n\nThe students in various institutions received cheques as bursaries in the company\u2019s annual scholarship award programme, as the skill acquisition programme will be coordinated by Industrial Trust Fund (ITF).\n\nThe move was in furtherance of the company\u2019s contributions to the socio-economic development of its host communities in health, education and infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking at the training programme, plant director, Dangote Cement Ibese, Azad Nawabuddin, Dangote Cement is committed to building the capacity of the people and institutions in the communities, particularly youths by identifying skill gaps and partnering to sharpen their skills and make them self-reliant.\n\nAccording to Nawabuddin, \u201c215 youths across the 16 host communities who constitute Dangote\u2019s key stakeholders have so far, been trained and empowered in different skills since the commencement of operations in Ibese with significant impact on the local economy.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with the ITF started in 2019 with the training and empowerment of 15 youths from the host communities on catering and event management, while 50 youths benefitted from the scheme in the specialised area of Acutherapy (alternative medicine) in 2020. This time, we are gathered to declare open, the 2021 training and empowerment programme on tailoring and fashion designing for 30 youths who have been carefully selected from our host communities\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Dangote Cement boss pointed out that the commencement of the training coincided with the flag-off of the 2021 Dangote sustainability week at the Ibese plant, with the theme \u201cBuilding a sustainable future \u2013 the Dangote Way\u201d noting that \u201cthe sustainability activity is an employee volunteering programme, and I am pleased to announce that the focus for this year is also our local communities. All these are evidence of our passion for the standard of living and well-being of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nHe then urged the beneficiaries of the training programme to make good use of the opportunity by paying attention to details in class and asking questions from your facilitators whenever in doubt.\n\nAlso the Area Manager, ITF in Ogun state, Funmi Coker, lauded Dangote Cement for the gesture to train the youths promising that the beneficiaries would get the best of training in tailoring and fashion designing which would serve as a source of livelihood for them.\n\nShe stated that in line with the ITF strategy, the trainees would not just be trained and be left alone, \u201cthey are going to get necessary materials for startup after the completion of training. we are going to training them for three months and each of them will get a startup pack, after the training, we are going to give them sewing machine.\u201d\n\nShe said the year 2021 has been declared as a Year of Skill Escalation for Prosperity because the ITF management has realised that accelerated skill acquisition is the only way to stem the rampant unemployment especially among the youths because skill acquisition will alleviate poverty, youth restiveness, create jobs and wealth in the economy and country.\n\nCoker therefore commended Dangote cement efforts by keying into the programme towards the developments of its immediate society. She then tasked other corporate organisations to emulate the good work of Dangote Cement in this regard.\n\nExpressing the happiness of the communities with Dangote Cement in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the vice-chairman of Ewekoro local government, Olabode Sunkanmi thanked the management of Dangote Cement for the empowerment programme, saying it would go a long way in sustain the youths and reduce unemployment.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

          "text": "TikTok in Europe has seen an increase of 545 percent to $170.8 million in revenue last year as advertisers upped their spending on the platform, according to a filing with the U.K.\u2019s company registry on Monday.\n\nThe data shows how TikTok has invested heavily in scaling up its European business as it looks to take on rivals like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snap.\n\nLosses at the Chinese-owned firm soared from $118.7 million in 2019 to $644.3 million in 2020.\n\nAccording to a TikTok spokesperson the results \u201creflect an exciting period of growth for the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw revenue increase significantly as our community grew, and we\u2019ve continued to invest aggressively in building a solid foundation for the long-term success of the platform\u201d.\n\nStaff has been one of TikTok\u2019s biggest expenses. The company\u2019s headcount in Europe rose by over 1,000 people last year, going from 208 in 2019 to 1,294 in 2020.\n\nBeyond staff, TikTok also spent $344.9 million on selling and marketing expenses in 2020, up from $110.3 million in 2019, according to the filing.\n\nTikTok\u2019s popularity has boomed in the last three years and last week it announced that it has 1 billion monthly active users on its platform, up 45% on July 2020.\n\nTikTok said it had about 55 million global users by Jan. 2018. That number grew to more than 271 million by Dec. 2018 and 507 million by Dec. 2019. The company reported nearly 700 million monthly active users last summer.\n\nBut TikTok is aware that the growth may not last forever. The company, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, noted under a \u201cbusiness risk\u201d section that it \u201cfaces competition from internet companies that operate content-based social platforms.\u201d Indeed, Facebook and Snap are among TikTok\u2019s biggest competitors and they\u2019re all fighting for advertising dollars.\n\nThe size of these social media companies has led them to come under increasing levels of scrutiny from regulators in recent years. Under a \u201ccompliance risk\u201d section of the filing, TikTok noted that it is \u201csubject to a range of new and existing laws in a regulatory landscape that can change.\u201d\n\nThe company has faced a number of setbacks, including a possible U.S. ban after the former Trump administration deemed its data storage and security a national security risk.\n\nTikTok was to be sold to an American company if it wanted to keep operating widely, with Oracle later being named as its \u201ctrusted technology provider.\u201d\n\nHowever, President Joe Biden\u2019s ascension to the White House allowed the company to continue operating as normal. In February, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Oracle deal had been \u201cshelved indefinitely.\u201d Biden this summer also signed an executive order that sets criteria for the government to evaluate the risk of apps connected to foreign adversaries.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
