          "text": "A former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has replied Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State over the latter\u2019s criticism of his resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nObi, while faulting Wike for questioning his loyalty and integrity to the PDP, stated that integrity was about prudent management of public resources and not membership of a political party.\n\nWike had on Thursday taken a swipe at Obi for quitting the PDP few days to the presidential primary of the opposition party.\n\nWike, who is running for president on the platform of the PDP where Obi was also an aspirant, had said the ex-Anambra governor had not won an election since he left the All Progressives Grand Alliance.\n\nWike had said, \u201cIt is not surprising to me. Peter Obi leaving the party is not surprising to me. I know and he knows that there was no way he would have won the presidential primary. The issue is that there must be integrity, there must be character. How can a man who had gone to all the states to tell them how he had been a trader, how his family has been trading, how everybody should support him, how he wore one (pair of) shoe(s), how he did not allow anybody to carry his bag, and all those things\u2026three days to the primaries, he said he had left the party. Integrity\u2026character is very important in whatever you are doing.\u201d\n\nReplying Wike on the same programme on Friday, Obi, who had earlier dodged a question seeking his reaction, said nobody could question his loyalty to the PDP while in the party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that one came in but I think when we talk about integrity, we are talking about integrity in management of public resources. That is what we should be talking about in this country. And when such things are mentioned about me, I feel maybe there is something missing somehow. Go and check my records as a governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have moved on to where the process might allow me,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Ondo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party says indication have emerged that the ruling All Progressives Congress would lose the general elections in the state, given how rancorous the APC primaries in the state were.\n\nThe opposition party said the primaries so far conducted by the ruling party had shown that the APC would have a tragic outing in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by the Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Kennedy Peretei, on Friday, in Akure, the state capital.\n\nAccording to Ondo PDP, APC primaries have been marred by irregularities.\n\nThe opposition party said, \u201cThe next couple of days will be very interesting. The APC would have finally extinguished itself. In Ondo State, for example, one does not need the prophetic exactitude of a Jewish prophet to know that the Rotimi Akeredolu-led APC will have a tragic outing in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWhereas, the PDP held credible, transparent and peaceful party primaries across Nigeria, for state Houses of Assembly and National Assembly, the APC keeps adjusting and readjusting the timetable for screening presidential aspirants and party primaries, all with the intention to foist an anointed presidential candidate through an arm-twisting process called consensus.\n\n\u201cIf General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.) was able to put up with this kind of anomaly during the heavily compromised APC national convention in \u2018selecting\u2019 national officers for the party, it may not be a tea party for choosing who becomes the standard bearer for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cNot many supporters and faithful of the APC in Ondo State could come to terms with the audacity and high-handedness with which the state leaders of the party distributed party tickets to individuals that they consider as loyal party members. All the 26 House of Assembly candidates were handpicked. Those who insisted on party primaries were blackmailed and intimidated to withdraw.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen members of his party complained, an official statement was issued by his media handlers to muscle up dissenting voices, dismissing them as not appreciating the trouble Akeredolu takes in holding the party together.\n\n\u201cOn the appointed date for the primaries, delegates were shocked as designated venues were desolate. Needless to say that all aggrieved persons are waiting to participate in the final burial rites of the APC.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged Governor Rotimi Akededolu and other APC to shun actions that could consign internal democracy to the dustbin, saying \u201cIt is \u2018unlawyerly\u2019 and primitive to think people can be taken for a ride in this crude manner.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi against the Rivers State Government on the Justice George Omereji Judicial Commission of Inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court in dismissing the appeal pronounced that the function of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry was mere investigative, that nobody, neither Amaechi nor anyone else, was on trial before the panel.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court ruling clearly vindicates the former Governor of Rivers State. The apex court was categorical and clear that Amaechi was not on trial.\n\nThe implication of this is that any indictment from the Commission is null and void and cannot stand.\n\n\u201cWith this judgment, Amaechi has been vindicated and cleared of all purported or alleged indictment by the Governor Wike\u2019s Commission.\n\n\u201cIt has been further settled that the decisions/recommendations of the commission of inquiry and subsequent White Paper issued by the State Government is not a conviction or indictment and cannot stand.\n\n\u201cFrom the onset, it was obvious to any discerning mind that the Commission was set up to embarrass, denigrate and humiliate Amaechi.\n\n\u201cThe apex court\u2019s judgment today further buttressed this stance. A commission purportedly set up to investigate past financial transactions was actually a commission to personally witch-hunt Amaechi,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWike had, shortly after assuming office in 2015 constituted the Justice George Omeregi-led judicial commission of inquiry to probe the alleged sale of state assets by the immediate past administration led by Amaechi.\n\nAmaechi challenged the decision of the governor at the High Court of Rivers State in a suit marked: PHC/187/15.\n\nIn a judgment on August 20, 2015, Justice Simeon Amadi held, among others, that the judicial commission of inquiry was not established to investigate the personal activities of the former governor, but set up to investigate the previous actions of the government as they affect the people of Rivers State.\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal also expressed a similar view, which was also reflected in the judgment of the Supreme Court on Friday.",

          "text": "Two big contests should currently be taking place in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory ( FCT). Public attention is on the historic presidential primaries of the two major political parties-the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP).\n\nBetween today and tomorrow, or by Monday, the two platforms should be presenting their candidates for next year\u2019s poll to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the electorate.\n\nEither of the two flagbearers will succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, whose tenure expires on May 29, 2023. But, while PDP is forging ahead, there is no sign of readiness on the part of the ruling party.\n\nIf PDP produces a candidate tomorrow and the APC candidate is nowhere to be found, it would mean that the APC forced the hand of the electoral commission to amend the electoral timetable.\n\nMany factors will shape the contests. They include the credentials of aspirants, their structures, cross-regional support, experience and may be, capability. However, delegates are not captivated by the manifestos or programmes of action reeled out by aspirants. This should have been the core issue in a nation-state of despair. But, their preoccupation is money. It may therefore, be assumed that the greatest factor is the deep purse of the aspirants.\n\nIf one of the deciding factors at the primaries will not be manifestos echoed by last minute speeches of aspirants at the nomination convention, then, Nigeria will not be witnessing primaries of quality. The state of affairs underscores the level of political culture, the level of national development and the immaturity of the political system. The delegates have no independent opinion. The distribution is as follows in PDP: Northwest 193, Southwest 143, Northcentral 130, Southsouth 129, Northeast 116 and Southeast 100. It is curious that the Southeast, which has the least number of delegates, has the highest number of aspirants.\n\nIn APC, the Southwest has the highest number of contenders. They all belong to one political family. It means the region lacks a coordinated agenda. But, of the six from the Southwest, it appears only their leader has the chance of getting the ticket, if there will be no surprises.\n\nSpecifically, zoning remains a factor, but it depends on the relative capacity of contenders to manipulate ethnicity and religion, or frontally insist on the previous tradition of rotation that is being threatened by lack of consistency, insincerity and new strategy. The annulment of zoning was tantamount to a disregard for diversity, equity and justice. The result may be a fierce competition between the North and the South.\n\nRead Also; APC and plot to draft Jonathan into presidential race\n\nIn the ruling party, the preference of the president may be a factor that will either make or mar the rocess. President Buhari once hinted about a preferred choice. His media adviser, Femi Adesina, also confirmed it. It is a big hurdle for the Commander-In-Chief and party leader, who may directly polarise his party and ultimately become a divisive factor at the primary. It appears the mood of the majority, including governors who are controllers of delegates from their states, may not favour consensus candidacy.\n\nThose said to be banking on presidential endorsement are about eight. This has sparked a sort of sibling rivalry. The endorsement of any of them translates into preferential treatment, and ultimate rejection of other contenders who also claim to be loyal to the president.\n\nToday\u2019s exercise is a wide departure from past contests. It may be the most democratic primaries. All the delegates were elected in APC and PDP. Special delegates, commonly referred to as statutory delegates, will not participate, following the President\u2019s refusal to sign the Electoral Act. Again, it worths repeating that the commoner-delegates, though democratically elected or selected, are in the pocket of the governors. The number of delegates has decreased considerately. The exercises may be manageable. There may be no waste of time.\n\nThe alpha and omega of the parties, including the president, former president, their deputies, governors, ministers, party officers and presidential aspirants, are not eligible to vote. The beautiful brides are the adhoc delegates from 774 local governments.\n\nWhat was worrisome and confusing to many APC stakeholders during the week was the insinuation that three paper-weight aspirants had entered the race again through the back door. Nomination forms were obtained for former President Goodluck Jonathan, who repudiated the activities of certain overzealous supporters, who bought the form for him; Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele, who despite being rated as a political neophyte, promised to shock the nation, and African Development Bank (AFDB) President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who ran back while gazing at the furnace from afar.\n\nIf they ever submitted the forms, it was without public knowledge, because the party had told reporters in Abuja that only 25 aspirants returned the forms. If they participate at the primary, then, the exercise will be controversial. It is a crowded race in APC. The aspirants know their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNo APC aspirant has campaigned more than the great leader and mobiliser,\n\nAsiwaju Bola Tinubu, national leader of APC. He has forged ahead with courage, resilience and determination. Ordinarily, he should have an edge as an experienced stalwart and one of the founding fathers of the party.\n\nTinubu has been traversing the chapters, selling himself. He started early. Delegates believe their national leader. His structure is solid and formidable. He has the name and recognition, having established himself as a bridge builder. Party men have a lot of testimonies to give about Tinubu\u2019s sense of accommodation, tolerance, forgiving spirit and generosity. Many Nigerians remember with fondness the Tinubu years in Lagos State. As governor, he was a model. Therefore, he flaunts his credentials as a tested and trusted administrator, a visionary, a financial surgeon and man of mega capabilities. The eminent politician comes from the Southwest, which is the cradle and stronghold of the ruling party he had laboured to build along with President Buhari and other compatriots across the six zones. While he is expected to win resoundingly in his zone, he is also loved in the North. Despite his labours and fidelity to the APC, Tinubu may still have to work on few powerful, vested interests, who are against him without justification. Observers contend that the choice of a standard bearer will predict how far the APC can go in next year\u2019s election. If the cabal tries to edge out a candidate that may easily garner popular votes, what magic can they perform on poll day? It will be useless to dump a popular candidate through intra-party manipulation, only for the manipulators to turn around again to seek for an inexplicable reconciliation after the primary, for the purpose of persuading the same aspirant they ignored at the shadow poll to lead the election campaign.\n\nOne of Tinubu\u2019s opponents is Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a professor of law he nominated in 2015, and who had served under his leadership as Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice. He has continually drew attention to being in the number two position in the last seven years, thereby gaining much experience. He has also acted as president.\n\nBut, Osinbajo\u2019s structure is not strong. His political experience is not deep. In fact, the pursuit of presidential ambition marked his foray into partisan politics. The vice president is banking on being anointed by his boss. If he gets the ticket, he will need to work very hard to win the election. One thing that cannot be taken away from Osinbajo is his verbal facility. The vice president is vocal.\n\nMinister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi may not be as vocal as Osinbajo, but he is more politically experienced than the number two citizen. He has served as Speaker for eight years and governor for another eight year\u2019s. A member of the second generation of leaders thrown up by the Fourth Republic, he is acknowledged in the APC as a rich chieftain, who made financial contributions to the 2015 campaigns.\n\nHowever, Amaechi does not have base. He has failed to lead his his party to victory in Rivers. Thus, his succession plan failed in 2015 and 2019. Governor Nyesom Wike is trying to torment him by making some allegations about turbine. There is also a case in court.\n\nBe that as it may, Amaechi can go to sleep over two ststes-Rivers and Plateau. It is risky for other aspirants to ignore him. He is too clever.\n\nThe entry of Senate President Ahmed Lawan into the race was a surprise. He is credited with a great deal of legislative experience spanning two decades. He may be relying on few who are projecting him. But, so far, Lawan has shown decorum, judging by his not-a-do-or-die style.\n\nSome people are neck-deep in geo-political calculus. But, the underlying reason is devoid of logic. If the schemers say APC must pick a Northerner as presidential candidate because PDP may pick a Northerner, does that not mean that they are treating Southerners as fools? How can they justify the possibility of retaining the highest office in the North for 16 years?\n\nThe second Northern aspirant is Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello, who has toiled for the party during the membership registration. His style is different. The young politician is campaigning as if he is preparing for a general election. He is also very popular in the media. Bello is reaching out to youths and women, who he described as the segments with greater numerical strength. Will they deliver him at the primary? Will be garner enormous political capital?\n\nSince Senator Ibikunle Amosu declared for president at Abuja, much has not been heard about him. He was present when Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi unfolded his plans at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Fayemi returned the visit when the former governor unfolded his ambition.\n\nWhile Fayemi, war scholar and former Steel and Solid Minerals Minister, has been visiting some chapters, former House of Representatives Speaker Dimeji Bankole has not been visible on campaign ground. Is he in the race for relevance?\n\nAlso, Emeka Nwajiuba, the only minister who had the courage to resign and earned the praise of Buhari, who booted others out for failing to toe the same line, is not involved in any effective campaign or delegate targeting.\n\nEbonyi State Governor Dave Umahi will surely pull more votes from delegates from his state than elderstatesman Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu. But, there ends the story.\n\nThe same applies to his Cross River counterpart, Senator Prof. Ben Ayade, a reluctant contestant who appeared to have applied for the job of campaign manager for Jonathan.\n\nUp to the time of writing this piece, APC was still dillydallying about its presidential primary. There was no sign of an impending event at Eagle Square, Abuja. The planning committee and sub-committees were not in place. All preparations paled into day dreaming, except the planning can be done within 24 hours.\n\nIn PDP, there are 15 contenders. Eyes are on about four or five-former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, and governors of Sokoto, Bauchi and Rivers-Aminu Tambuwal, Senator Bala Mohammed and Nyesom Wike.\n\nIf the PDP governors agree to work together, it will be the end of the road for Atiku. But, their lack of agreement is to the advantage of the experienced politician and veteran presidential aspirant. At 76, it is believed that the contest may be his last chance. Therefore, the political warhorse is putting everything into it.\n\nAtiku\u2019s structure is not doubtful. He is a household name in Nigeria. He has networks, financial arsenal and wide connection. Majority of founding fathers and elders flock with Atiku. At a time, his former boss, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, devoted chapters to him in his book, calling him all sorts of name. He poured venom on his former ally. Four years later, OBJ started projecting him.\n\nHowever, this time around, Atiku does not appear to be the candidate of the Generals, including Evil Genius Ibrahim Babangida, Abdulsalami Abubakar and Gusau. It appears they are tilting towards Saraki, Waziri of Ilorin.\n\nSome analysts believe that Saraki cannot be underrated as a political warrior. He has contested twice. He had positioned himself very well in the period of crisis. As leader of the PDP reconciliation team, he used the opportunity to build structures and sell himself to the various chapters.\n\nWill he attain the highest seat, which his illustrious father, Dr. Olusola Saraki, failed to attain? Time will tell. Ahead of the primary, Peter Obi crashed himself out. He had expected the party to stick to zoning. The neglect of rotation was infuriating to him. Therefore, he quit both the race and the party.\n\nObi is a man of reputation; frugal, morally clean as it were, and a wordsmith. But, he may have over-exergerrated his political worth and stature. Many expressed concern about his exit from the race, not because he can win the ticket, but because he is perceived as a good man. His absence may be a plus for Wike, who may now get the attention of Anambra delegates.\n\nIn fact, the Rivers governor has proved that he can rub shoulders with any contestant in PDP. He is very aggressive. A trend is emerging. The likelihood exists that governors of Rivers are potential presidential aspirants. Why? It is a rich state and the governors can flex muscles with the quantum of resources, to the envy of less-endowed states. Indeed, when observers paint a picture of naira and dollar war that may characterise the process, they have in mind the former vice president and governor of the oil-rich state.\n\nIn this electioneering, Wike is flaunting his score card as governor. Generally, it is believed that he has performed. He is also an experienced actor, having served as council chairman, chief of staff and minister.\n\nApart from his likely impressive showing in Benue, where his friend, Sam Ortom, calls the shots, Wike has tentacles in the Southwest, Southsouth and Southeast. But for his free use of words, he would have attracted more alliances. He is bold and brave. But, he is misunderstood as a political aggressor.\n\nWhile Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom will cart away delegate votes from his state, aspirants like Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, former Senate President Pius Anyim, publisher Dele Momodu and Sam Ohunabunwa may end up as venerable spectators at the primary.\n\nPDP is ready. But, APC does not appear to be ready.",
          "summary": "If PDP produces a candidate tomorrow and the APC candidate is nowhere to be found, it would mean that the APC forced the hand of the electoral commission to amend the electoral timetable.\nAll the delegates were elected in APC and PDP.\nNo APC aspirant has campaigned more than the great leader and mobiliser,Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, national leader of APC.\nHe was present when Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi unfolded his plans at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\nEbonyi State Governor Dave Umahi will surely pull more votes from delegates from his state than elderstatesman Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu.",

          "title": "APC, PDP presidential primaries: How the aspirants stand \u2013 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "SPECIAL REPORTS\n\nFrom our reporters\n\nLike a heavily pregnant woman gripped with apprehension over her fate until she is delivered, Nigerians have been anxious over the two aspirants out of the about 38 that will fly the presidential flags of the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 election.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSuch anxiety ends between this weekend and Monday next week, as the two parties hold their presidential primaries to choose their candidates.\n\nReligious and ethnic sentiments; personalities, influence and money will shape the outcome of the party primaries. From our reporters across the country, six aspirants are top runners in the PDP. They are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; ex-Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike and Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed.\n\nIn APC, there are also six front runners: Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo; APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu; former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi.\n\nBreaking!!!

We have always hit the bull\u2019s eye in the past with our reports.\n\nBarring any consensus arrangement, this report represents the outcome of these primary elections.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nPDP: How delegates will vote\n\nEnugu: Wike tops, others follow\n\nEnugu being a PDP state, it is expected that the leader of the party and governor, as usual in such cases will direct how the PDP delegates vote. If the body language of Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi should be taken seriously, then it might be safe to say that the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike will carry Enugu State\u2019s votes. Observers say Gov. Ugwuanyi has not identified with any other aspirant, than Wike.\n\nWith Peter Obi out of the race, having pulled of of the PDP, it appears to be Wike\u201d\u2019s game. However, the Ike Ekweremadu factor cannot be ruled out. Since the former Deputy Senate President is not working with Ugwuanyi, having lost out in the governorship primary, it is expected that Bukola Saraki stands a chance in Enugu. It was Saraki that supported Ekweremadu to be Deputy Senate President in 2015, even when APC senators dominated the Assembly. Now is pay back time. It is expected that delegates sympathetic to Ekweremadu will support Saraki. Anyim cannot also be written off.\n\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, however, Wike may get more votes than others in Enugu.\n\nImo: It\u2019s dicey\n\nIn Imo State, it is going to be a tough decision for the delegates of the PDP to make. If he had not dumped the PDP, former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi might have won more votes than the other aspirants. Abubakar Saraki, Governors Nyesom Wike and Aminu Tambuwal as well as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will share the votes.\n\nKwara: Saraki all the way\n\nHere, the home-zone advantage for Saraki is 100 per cent. It\u2019s a no contest state. So other PDP candidates should not expect much from here.\n\nOyo: Delegates expected to follow Makinde\n\nThe sitting governor, Seyi Makinde, according to investigation, will really influence the presidential aspirant that all the 33 delegates from the state will queue behind. It is one delegate per each of the 33 local government areas of the state. Makinde is close to Wike and Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom.\n\nAkwa Ibom: It\u2019s Emmanuel 100%\n\nThe state governor, Udom Emmanuel will gather 31 votes from the delegates. Only Mr. Peter Obi and the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar went there to consult the party\u2019s delegates. However, each of the delegates would not have a mind of their own, but do the bidding of the governor to either vote for him or whom he would align with.\n\nNiger: It\u2019s Atiku, Saraki and Bala Mohammed\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar is expected to garner most of the votes, even though about eight aspirants visited the 98 delegates. Saraki and Bala Mohammed are also visible here.\n\nRivers: it\u2019s Wike\u2019s turf\n\nThe state governor, Nyesom Wike and presidential aspirant will ride on the party\u2019s one family and loyalty. The party in Rivers State has remained a unified body and with the governor\u2019s grip of the party\u2019s structure, there is no doubt he would get bulk vote.\n\nKebbi: Delegates undecided\n\nDelegates voting patterns will be the decision of leaders of the party. Atiku and Saraki might get most of the votes here.\n\nKogi: Saraki, Atiku on top\n\nAbout 80 per cent of the delegates votes will be shared between Saraki and Atiku.\n\nEbonyi: It\u2019s Anyim all the way\n\nThis is the state of the former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim. Delegates have also pledged to vote for him during the convention.\n\nOgun: Atiku, Saraki to slug it out\n\nThe Ogun State chapter of PDP is still enmeshed in intra-party squabbles. The reconciliation of the late Senator Buruji Kashamu and Ladi Adebutu factions seems to be just a window dressing. As at present, the party has two factional candidates in almost every elective position, with each faction claiming legitimacy.\n\nHowever, the state delegates loyal to Adebutu may likely go for Atiku Abubakar, while the second faction may prefer former Senate President, Bukola Saraki.\n\nPlateau: Ex-Gov Jang to influence votes\n\nIn Plateau State, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike because of his affiliation with the party leader and former governor, Jonah David Jang, and his support to the PDP in Plateau State, might make strong show here. However, some of the party faithful are working round the delegates to woo support for Atiku, Saraki and Bala Mohammed.\n\nAbia: Wike expected to take majority, Anyim follows\n\nAbia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu is rooting for his Rivers counterpart. And Wike is expected to get majority of the delegates\u2019 votes, especially since Peter Obi is no longer in contention. Anyim, being the other major South East candidate, hopes to get something.\n\nKano: Northern elders to decide\n\nThere are various litigations in the court between the Aminu Wali faction and the Shagagi led state executive. This situation has left a trail of confusion in the party. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure where the pendulum will swing. A very credible source told Saturday Sun that a lot would depend on the choice of the Northern Elders, stressing that Northern delegates have always been well guided about who to vote for on occasions like this, which has huge implications on who governs Nigeria and in the interests of the North. Saraki and Bala Mohammed are northern consensus aspirants, selected nu Northern Elders.\n\nNasarawa: It\u2019s Saraki, Wike and Atiku\n\nIt is crystal clear that the votes of delegates from the Nasarawa State could be shared among Saraki, Atiku and Wike, with the former Senate president having an upper hand because it is his zone; that is the North Central.\n\nSaraki, once the chairman of National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee (NRSC), played a major role in fostering unity and cohesion in the state chapter of the party. This could be an avenue to repay his good gesture at the convention.\n\nThe former Senate president also enjoys the support of some critical stakeholders of the party like Senator Suleiman Adokwe, Senator Phillip Gyunka and Senator Solomon Ewuga; all would help in gathering delegates votes for him.\n\nMeanwhile in the last few months, Governor Wike had also made tremendous efforts in swinging delegates through his close associate, Hon. David Ombugadu, while Atiku hopes for a surprise.\n\nOndo: Atiku, Saraki, Wike ahead\n\nThe cold war between the former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and the governorship candidate of the party in the last election, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede is one major factor affecting the choice of presidential aspirants. To this end, the state chapter of the party may have their votes divided, as loyalists of Mimiko and Jegede who make the list of delegates will vote for the preferred choice of their leaders. It was said that Jegede was supporting former Vice -President,Atiku Abubakar, while Mimiko is supporting Governor Wike. Saraki is banking on his goodwill.\n\nDelta: Saraki is on ground\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, the Delta State Government House, Asaba, has become a political Mecca of sorts, playing host to an array of presidential aspirants on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP). But Dr. Bukola Saraki seems to be the leading presidential aspirant among ad-hoc delegates of the PDP in state. Besides, Okowa\u2019s secret ambition to run as vice president to a northern candidate appears to have found more favour with the Saraki candidacy. Although, other aspirants might get a share of the delegates\u2019 votes from Delta, their score would be insignificant to swing the pendulum. However, for Atiku, it is believed that his relationship with former governor, James Ibori, would swing a surprise, but most delegates appear not to be too comfortable with his age.\n\nBenue: Aspirants might share votes\n\nThe relationship between the state governor, Samuel Ortom and the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, as well as that between former governor, Gabriel Suswam and Akwa Ibom governor, Emmanuel Udom, will determine the voting pattern. Also, Ortom said a lot of good things about Saraki when the former Senate President met Benue delegates.\n\nOsun: It\u2019s Saraki, Atiku\n\nThe two factions of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have agreed to share the slots of delegates for the presidential primary. The two factions reached an agreement due to the intervention of the reconciliation committee. There is no doubt that the faction of the governorship candidate of PDP, Senator Ademola Adeleke, would be supporting Senator Bukola Saraki, because of his close relationship with the family. Adeleke openly endorsed Saraki when the latter met the state\u2019s delegates.\n\nThe faction of Prince Dotun Babayemi is likely to support Atiku Abubakar because the former governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who belongs to this faction, is likely to play a major role in the determination of the choice of candidate for this faction.\n\nEdo: Atiku, Wike, Saraki to share\n\nThere are two factions in the party in Edo \u2013 the state governor\u2019s faction and the faction of the South-South National Vice Chairmanship of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, following from the crisis rocking the party in the state. Obaseki\u2019s faction is said to backing Atiku Abubakar while Orbih\u2019s faction is supporting Wike. Saraki is banking on his goodwill.\n\nKaduna: Still open\n\nFor Kaduna PDP national delegates, it appears they will pull their weights behind the most appealing aspirant. Recent receptions accorded various presidential aspirants that came canvassing for their votes for the primaries showed the direction they would take. Nothing is given yet, but it is believed that Saraki, Atiku and Bala Mohammed might share the spoils.\n\nBorno: It\u2019s Atiku and Bala Mohammed\n\nThe PDP delegates are working on regional loyalty for Atiku Abubakar and Bala Mohammed, who are from the same North-East Zone. Sources also said money has huge influence on the preference of Atiku, who allegedly released funds to support the party in the state.\n\nAnambra: It\u2019s Saraki and Anyim\n\nWith Obi out, Anambra is for Saraki. It was gathered that most of the delegates are from the structure of a former governorship aspirant who recently rejoined the party and has sympathy for Saraki. Anyim may reap from Obi\u2019s absence being the other South-East candidate in reckoning.\n\nCross River: It\u2019s Wike, Emmanuel, but Atiku may get something\n\nWike is said to be a household name in Cross River PDP, as he has been the pillar behind the party and its leadership. It was learnt that Wike has been the financial backbone of the party since the defection of Governor Ben Ayade to APC since last year. He\u2019s likely to get most of the votes here. However, Gov Emmanuel and Atiku will also get some votes. Atiku has close relationship with former governor Liyel Imoke, who is the party leader.\n\nBayelsa: All eyes on Gov Diri\n\nGovernor Douye Diri will ultimately determine where the national delegates from Bayelsa State would vote. He is somehow close to practically all the northern aspirants \u2013 Bala Mohammed, Aminu Tambuwal, Atiku Abubakar and Saraki. The same way he enjoys a robust relationship with Governor Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom.\n\nLagos: Between Saraki, Atiku\n\nPDP delegates in Lagos will likely pitch their tents for Saraki and Atiku .\n\nSokoto: Tambuwal\u2019s exclusive zone\n\nSokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who is also a presidential aspirant will pick all the votes from the delegates.\n\nAdamawa: All for Atiku\n\nThis is the state of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. No ticket will fall for any other aspirant.\n\nGombe: Atiku, Mohammed share votes\n\nDelegates will share their votes between Atiku Abubakar and Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed.\n\nYobe: Atiku is comfortable\n\nAtiku Abubakar will maintain a comfortable lead, but Mohammed, Saraki will scratch some votes.\n\nJigawa: Tambuwal, Atiku, Mohammed\n\nAminu Tambuwal, Atiku Abubakar and Bala Mohammed will share votes.\n\nTaraba: Atiku in control\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAtiku Abubakar is in control here\n\nZamara : Tambuwal holds the ace\n\nSokoto governor, Tambuwal has no one to contend with.\n\nKatsina: Atiku is on ground\n\nAtiku Abubakar is ahead of others here.\n\nAPC: How aspirants stand\n\nEnugu: State party leaders to decide.\n\nIt is expected that the direction the delegates will follow will be decided by the state leaders of the party. Though the leadership and delegates of both parties have been receiving presidential aspirants, there is nothing to show where the interests of the delegates lie.\n\nImo: Lawan holds the ace\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an easy ride for Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, as the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodimma has not hidden his support for him. It is expected that the governor would apply all the machineries of government and strong support he is having from above to push Lawan to the finishing line.\n\nKwara: For Tinubu, Lawan, Osinbajo\n\nTinubu might get a large chunk of the votes from the state. The governor and leader of the party, Mallam AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq glowingly spoke of his efforts in the Otoge struggle, which assisted the party to win the 2019 elections. Some delegates might also go for Lawan and Vice President Osinbajo.\n\nOyo: Osinbajo, Tinubu, Fayemi will share votes\n\nThe votes of all the delegates from the pace setter state may be divided majorly among three of the presidential aspirants \u2013 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Ekiti State governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.\n\nAkwa Ibom: Akpabio\u2019s fortress\n\nThe votes will go to Godswill Akpabio, who is considered the leader of the party in the state. Apart from vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, no other APC aspirant has bothered to come to the state for consultation, thus leaving the field for Akpabio as the net beneficiary of votes from the state.\n\nNiger: Lawan, Osinbajo, Tinubu to share votes\n\nNo fewer than six presidential aspirants on the platform of the party have met with the delegates in Minna, the state capital. The votes of the Niger State delegates might be shared among Lawan, Osinbajo and Tinubu.\n\nRivers: Amaechi, Tinubu battle for votes\n\nThe APC in Rivers State has since been factionalized between Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe. The latter\u2019s loyalists will most likely cast their votes for Bola Tinubu. So, the voting strength of Rivers delegates at the presidential primaries is likely to be shared between Amaechi and Tinubu.\n\nKebbi: The governor to decide\n\nDespite the few presidential aspirants that have been in contact with the delegates and party chieftains, many people still believed that who the delegates will cast their votes for would be finally decided by the state governor. The main reason is that the delegates are loyalists of the governor.\n\nKogi: Bello\u2019s turf\n\nSince the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello is one of the aspirants; it is likely that he corners the votes of his state.\n\nEbonyi: Umahi all the way and Onu\n\nThe state governor, David Umahi is an aspirant. It is expected that he will get the votes here. Former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, is also from the state. With the factionalization of APC in the state, the votes will be split between Umahi and Onu.\n\nPlateau: Amaechi on top\n\nDelegates from the APC will likely cast their votes for Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi because of his relationship with Governor Simon Lalong, the APC party leader in Plateau.\n\nLalong had declared the support of Plateau delegates to Amaechi when he stormed Jos last week to interface with the delegates to woo their votes.\n\nOgun: Osinbajo, Tinubu to share votes\n\nThe party delegates were carefully and strategically \u2018elected\u2019 to ensure those loyal to the incumbent governor, Dapo Abiodun, made the delegates list. This step, according to a source within the party, was to ensure party members loyal to the immediate past governor did not make the list of the party faithful that will produce the presidential candidate of the party. Governor Abiodun made it clear when the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo visited Ogun that the state would give him maximum support at the convention. However, Tinubu cannot be ruled out as some of his political associates had hand in making Abiodun governor.\n\nAbia: Lawan, the man to beat\n\nWhile it is not totally clear who among the presidential aspirants the state delegates would vote for, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan could be the sure candidate. This is as a result of the tacit support the Senate President has been getting from the Senate Chief Whip and former governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu since he declared interest in the presidential race.\n\nKano: Gov might\n\nThe delegates are very loyal to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and most certainly, would vote for whosoever he chooses. From all indications, his vote is for Bola Ahmed Tinubu and they would vote in the same direction.\n\nNasarawa: Tinubu on ground\n\nDelegates that would attend the convention from Nasarawa State are loyalists of the former governor, Tanko Almakura. Almakura is a strong ally of Bola Ahmed Tinubu who recently visited the state in continuation of his meeting with delegates at the Government House, Lafia It is very clear that all delegates\u2019 votes may all go to the former governor of Lagos State.\n\nOndo: Delegates yet to decide\n\nThere is no clear indication yet on the presidential aspirant delegates from Ondo State will support, as the leader of the party in the state, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu was said to have remained quiet in giving direction to the party members across the state.\n\nDelta: Cose to call between Lawan, Amaechi, Osinbajo\n\nAmaechi\u2019s loyalists in Delta State will vote for him, while loyalists of the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who is the leader of the party in the state, will go for Lawan. Osinbajo hopes to reap from goodwill.\n\nBenue: Delegates still waiting for order\n\nThe leader of the party, Senator George Akume has not shown any preference for any presidential aspirant, and that is making it difficult for the party to take a position.\n\nOsun: Tinubu is it\n\nThe delegates are substantially for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. They did not hide this during the meeting with the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, as some of them put on caps with the inscription of Tinubu\u2019s logo.\n\nEdo: Tinubu gets lion\u2019s share, while Osinbajo picks the rest\n\nBola Tinubu looks good to get the support of most party delegates. The backing of former governor of the state and ex-National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and other strong political leaders in the state, would come handy to make this possible. Vice President Osinbajo who also has the backing of another former governor of the state, Prof. Osarheimen Osunbo, is likely to be runner-up to Tinubu.\n\nKaduna: Tinubu, Amaechi, Osinbajo share votes\n\nWhen Vice President Osinbajo, Bola Tinubu and Rotimi Amaechi visited the delegates at different times in Kaduna, the delegates pledged to vote for each of them. As it stands, the three aspirants would share the votes from this state.\n\nBorno: Lawan, Osinbajo, Tinubu to grab the votes\n\nThe 81 delegates votes will be shared among Lawan, Osinbajo and Tinubu. However, Amaechi may get very few \u2018compensatory\u2019 votes.\n\nAnambra: Lawan, Umahi\u2019s citadel\n\nThe delegates shall be voting for Lawan with Andy Ubah as strong factor. The links of Senator Orji Kalu in the state will also swing it for Lawan. However Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi, will get some votes as people of the South East believe that 2023 is their time to produce the country\u2019s president and would do everything within their powers to make it happen.\n\nEkiti: Fayemi all the way\n\nGov Fayemi will no doubt get most of the votes here. A few might be left for Tinubu and Osinbajo to share\n\nCross River: Lawan on ground\n\nGovernor Ben Ayade, the leader of the party, seems disposed to be working for Sen. Ahmad Lawan, who was said to have tacitly supported Ayade in his struggle to ensure that Senator Steven Odey was not thrown out of the senate chambers.\n\nDuring Lawan\u2019s visit to Cross River, the governor assured the Lawan team of at least 80 per cent of the delegates votes.\n\nHowever, Amaechi and Osinbajo would battle for the remaining votes.\n\nBayelsa: Unsure\n\nIn Bayelsa, with the Minister of State for Petroleum and former governor of the state, Chief Timipre Sylva dropping out of the Presidential race, the delegates of Bayelsa are up for any of the presidential aspirants.\n\nHowever, there is no love lost between Sylva and Amaechi so it is very certain that Sylva would do everything including ensuring that Bayelsa delegates do not vote for Amaechi to stop his presidential aspiration.\n\nLagos: Tinubu fully on ground\n\nIt goes without saying that Tinubu will get all the votes of the delegates\n\nSokoto: Lawan is ahead\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan is very comfortable\n\nYobe: 100% votes for Lawan\n\nThis is the state of the senate president. No vote will fall for any other aspirant.\n\nGombe: Lawan, Osinbajo share votes\n\nDelegates will share their votes between the senate president and the vice president\n\nAdamawa: Lawal is comfortable\n\nLawal will maintain a comfortable lead, but Osinbajo, Saraki will scratch some votes.\n\nJigawa: Lawal, Osinbajo, Tinubu shear votes\n\nThe senate president, vice president and leader of the party will share votes.\n\nTaraba: Lawan is in control\n\nThe senate president is absolutely in control\n\nZamfara: Survival of the fittest\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nAs correctly predicted by The Sun on its online platform last night, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may have bowed to pressures from political parties to extend the deadline for the conduct of primaries, shifting it by one week.\n\nInter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) had made a fresh appeal to the commission for the extension by one week, pleading that it will enable them to conclude all logistics concerning the primaries.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nIPAC chairman, Sani Yabagi, in his request during an emergency meeting with the commission in Abuja on Friday, claimed that \u201cif we are given more time, we will be able to deliver on the promise of having a free and fair elections as we conduct our primaries.\n\nWhile strengthening the request, the national chairman of Zenith Labour Party, Dan Nwanyanwu, specifically requested for an extension to June 9.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman before you respond, this was our position and this meeting was at our instance because of how we have overworked ourselves.\n\nBreaking!!!

Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election released on Saturday February 26, 2022.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the six-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\n\u201cThe commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\n\u201cThe commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cHowever, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries,\u201d the commission noted in the statement.\n\nGiving more information about INEC candidates nomination portal, the statement read: \u201cAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the commission, based on past experience, has decided to train the political party officials to make efficient and effective use of the portal. The Commission will train four officials from each of the 18 political parties, making a total of 72 in all.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report\n\nNigeria\u2019s low crude oil production means the country is barely able to cover the cost of imported petrol from its oil and gas revenue, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed said yesterday.\n\n\n\nAhmed, who said this in an interview with Reuters, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said she hoped Nigerian oil production would average 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from around 1.5 million bpd in the first quarter.\n\n\n\nThe government had budgeted 1.8 million bpd of production, Ahmed said, blaming crude theft and attacks on oil infrastructure for the shortfall.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing the revenues that we had planned for,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWhen the production is low it means we\u2019re \u2026 barely able to cover the volumes that are required for the (petrol) that we need to import.\u201d\n\n\n\nNigeria exports crude oil and imports refined petrol, suffering intermittent fuel shortages. It faces double-digit inflation and low growth, amid a shrinking labour market and mounting insecurity.\n\n\n\nA plan to abolish its petrol subsidy was scrapped ahead of national elections in February 2023 and recently, President Muhammadu Buhari got the National Assembly to approve N4 trillion for subsidies in 2022, up from the N400 billion initially projected for the purpose, putting pressure on the budget.\n\n\n\nNigeria raised $1.25 billion via a Eurobond sale in March at a premium rate and had planned to issue another bond.\n\nBut Ahmed said the government had \u201cnot seen a good opportunity to go in.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s deficit is set to rise to 4.5 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product this year due to the fuel subsidy, up from an original estimate of 3.42 per cent in the budget.\n\n\n\nAfter holding the Monetary Policy Rate constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the MPC on Tuesday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world. Inflation in Nigeria rose to 16.82 per cent in April, the highest in eight months.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the interest rate hike, Ahmed said the central bank move was necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, including a 50 basis-point rise earlier this month, alongside Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and coronavirus lockdowns in China have prompted a move from riskier emerging markets to safe havens.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are certainly very, very concerned,\u201d Ahmed said of the Fed\u2019s policy tightening. \u201cThe actions that the Fed or the central bank in Europe take will affect us.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari Talks Free Polls, Jonathan Attacks National Assembly, Faults Section 84 of New Electoral Act",
          "text": "\n\n*Declares lawmakers legislating to target particular persons, groups\n\n*Insists quality of delegates disgraceful, monetisation of process unacceptable\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to free, fair, and credible general election in 2023. Buhari also expressed his commitment to ensuring that only honest and reliable candidates won in the polls.\n\n\n\nThe assurances came just as in a rare public outburst yesterday, former President Goodluck Jonathan took a swipe at the National Assembly over the controversy surrounding section 84 of the Electoral Act, describing it as a mess.\n\nThis was just as divergent views emanated from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) barely 72 hours to its national convention, with members expressing fears over lack of activities in the party and indication of unpreparedness for the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\n\n\nAlso, yesterday, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command said it had put in place a robust security arrangement ahead of the presidential primary of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scheduled to hold May 28 and 29 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.\n\n\n\nBuhari spoke while playing host to an APC Kano Central senatorial aspirant, Senator Basheer Lado, at the State House, Abuja. Lado\u2019s meeting with the president came a day before the senatorial primary of the party holding today.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after the meeting, Lado said the President declared his commitment to credible elections that would ensure the emergence of candidates with integrity.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cAfter my briefing, Mr. President reiterated his commitment to credible and peaceful elections and also his desire to see candidates with integrity prevail at the polls all across Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Kano State is the largest producer of votes in Nigeria. It is the decider of who becomes the next president in the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust like my governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has done in the past, I respectfully informed and reassured Mr President that the APC is still the party to beat in Kano, despite recent defections.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, according to the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections released by APC, the screening of the presidential aspirants was supposed to take place last Monday. But as at yesterday, the screening committee that would assess the presidential aspirants was yet to be constituted. Accreditation of those that would be attending the convention was also yet to commence, while Eagle Square, venue of the convention, remained empty and deserted.\n\n\n\nDirector of Media, Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Ms. Yemi Kolapo, said she was not worried about the lack of activities in the party a few days to the primary election. Kolapo believed the party was only being strategic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so; they (APC) are only being strategic,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAsked if the failure of the party to constitute a screening committee was part of the strategy, Kolapo added, \u201cIt has been constituted since. They can\u2019t constitute for others and not constitute for presidential.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Osinbajo Support Group also said there was no need to worry, stressing that activities would commence at Eagle Square on Saturday. Convener of the group, Badmus Olawale, said, \u201cScreening can still happen 24 hours to the primary day. No worries whatsoever. You will see activities at the Eagle Square ground from Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Support Group (AATSG) wondered the kind of example APC was setting as a ruling party. National Publicity Secretary of the group, Hon. Sampson Oburu, said the ruling party ought to be doing everything right at all times.\n\n\n\nOburu said, \u201cLess than 72 hours to the primaries, no screening of aspirants, and possible debates between aspirants is zero. I wonder what kind of example we, as the ruling party, is setting after we promised Nigerians change.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe moved to the next level, one would have thought that we would move from doing things anyhow to doing the right things, the first time all the time, which to a large extent would muster unity within the party, raise the status of the party, and usher in a new era of hope.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important to sustain and in our own case now, restore confidence in the party by the electorate and public, because as it is, Nigerians are fast losing confidence in our ability to lead the country to the much needed next level.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are rancour and strife in almost all the states controlled by our party, multiple factions, poor internal democratic processes, where the electoral processes are hijacked by one or a few individuals against the collective strength of the majority.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn its part, the APC Rebirth Group expressed concerns about the lack of activities in the party. Its Convener, Mr. Aliyu Audu, stated, \u201cWhile we are concerned about the lack of activities to show that plans are in place for the special convention, we want to believe that everyone involved is aware of the implications of not having a duly elected presidential candidate by the 3rd of June 2022. So, there are probably plans in place that are unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, all appears set for the PDP presidential primary, with the Nigeria Police promising a strong security arrangement.\n\nThe event would involve a high influx of people into the nation\u2019s capital, and the FCT police say they have taken charge.\n\n\n\nThe FCT command said in a statement, \u201cConsequent upon the above and in a bid to ensure a hitch-free event, the FCT Police Command has designed a robust security arrangement defined by a generous deployment within and without the election ground and to every nook and cranny of the territory.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe deployment prioritises the protection of lives and properties of all and sundry by emplacing counter-insurgency measures, maintenance of clear road access, robust stop and search at strategic points around the suburbs and city centre, effective crowd control, and intelligence gathering.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe command asserted that the Commissioner of Police, FCT Police Command, CP Babaji Sunday, while briefing the divisional police officers, heads of the various tactical and intelligence units of the command scheduled for the operation, charged them to be effective in discharging their duties with utmost respect for fundamental human rights.\n\n\n\nSunday told FCT residents to go about their lawful duties without fear of harassment or molestation of any kind, urging them, also, to remain vigilant and report any suspicious or abnormal occurrence to the police.\n\nEx-President Jonathan Attacks National Assembly Over Section 84 of New Electoral Act\n\nMeanwhile, a usually measured and reticent Jonathan yesterday accused the federal lawmakers of making laws to target individuals and groups, rather than observing the long-held maxim that like judges, legislators must be \u201cblind\u201d in the process of law-making, instead of dishing out self-serving legislations.\n\n\n\nThe former president was speaking in Abuja at the presentation of a book titled: \u201cPolitical Party Governance,\u201d authored by a former Minister of State for Power, Dr. Mohammed Wakil.\n\n\n\nSome Nigerians recently expressed concerns that the National Assembly\u2019s amendment of some portions of the Electoral Act, 2022, especially Section 84 was designed to boost the chances of certain persons in the electoral race.\n\n\n\nJonathan, who rated the current primaries as a total failure insisted that if it was to be rated, the process would not have a pass mark and would be scored less than 25 per cent.\n\n\n\nPicking Bayelsa as a case study, the former Nigerian leader characterised the process as \u201chorrible,\u201d stating that for instance, certain people who did some \u201cmagic\u201d created just two wards in a particular state constituency where six elected delegates were to determine the fate of six aspirants in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to advise the National Assembly that laws must be designed to solve problems, not to create problems and that laws must be made assuming that those who are making the law are blind, just like the judges.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is so that they cannot be able to target an individual or a group of individuals and when you go into the system of making laws (like it is being done), you will make this terrible mistake that has really messed up the whole primaries that are going on.\n\n\n\n\u201c If you have not been involved in the process of primaries, you will be happy or you may not be happy, but for those of us who have been involved, it is terrible,\u201d he maintained.\n\n\n\nJonathan stressed that those who are current delegates could easily be bought over, decrying how low the standards have fallen such that aspirants are now openly retrieving monies paid to the delegates.\n\n\u201cTake my local government for example. My local government by divine providence has me as a former president, we have former governors, former deputy governors, former senators and all the rest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen only one elected delegate that you don\u2019t even know where it is coming from, will come to Abuja to select who becomes the presidential candidate. Is that the kind of democracy that we want to practice?\u201d he queried.\n\nThe former president alleged that the lawmakers had succeeded in strangulating the electoral system by going as far as determining the mode of primaries, arguing that every political party has its peculiarities.\n\n\n\nWhile contending that laws must not be made at the whims of individuals, Jonathan picked holes on the argument of those accusing Buhari of not immediately signing the amended sections sent to him by the lawmakers, saying that assent to bills must go through a thorough process.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis controversial Section 84, to me, if you read through that law, 80 per cent or more of that section has nothing to do with it and should be expunged from the Electoral Act because the National Assembly cannot make laws and lump up all the political parties together.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey must have the leverage to do things differently. Political parties have different reasons for being set up,\u201d he said, giving the instances of parties in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo parties cannot do things the same way. Creating a situation whereby every party must have the same way of doing things as to who will represent them is nonsense. It doesn\u2019t help the practice of democracy. We must allow the parties the leverage,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that since the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was already regulating the parties, they must be allowed to choose the method they would adopt in selecting candidates, as documented in their constitutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cParties are not parastatals of the government. And the national assembly cannot make laws to strangle the political parties and that is my thinking on this issue that is quite controversial,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe further called for the institutionalisation of democracy, instead of the current ad hoc practice by the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe have to institutionalise democracy. What is the quality of delegates where some people are even going back to delegates to ask for refund when they fail election? This is extremely disgraceful,\u201d he declared.\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cIn some countries, you cannot give a gift to the voter like what we normally do here where bags of rice and salt are shared. You are inducing the electorate and that\u2019s a criminal offence and the National Assembly should be able to criminalise this.\n\n\n\nAs it is now, Jonathan argued that any criminal can now aspire to the highest office of the land as far as the person has the money even if he\u2019s an armed robber.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I tell you the kind of people that are coming up to pick the people that will represent us, you will feel sad. So the National Assembly must have to wake up.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome people are even blaming the president that he did not sign this, he did not sign that and that is another area that the national assembly must wake up to. You cannot wake up the president and say come and sign a bill, whether a new bill or an alteration of an existing one.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this matter, the president can\u2019t be blamed. Before the president signs any bill into law, it passes through different processes after the national assembly and their committees finish their work,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him each member of the National Assembly has at least five aides who are expected to be involved in vetting any bill passed to the president, accusing the lawmakers of not doing their jobs properly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Speaker has more and the Senate President has more. What is their duty? Is it just to be following the speaker and the senate president like a troop of monkeys or a bevy of birds?\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are meant to read before it goes to the clerk of the national assembly that also has his own aides that will also read through that draft before it goes to the president and that\u2019s bureaucracy at the government level so that the president is not meant to make silly mistakes.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo nobody should expect the president to just wake up and say come sign this bill because it must go through a process and people must do their work in this country.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou cannot just be taking money and be sleeping and for the national assembly this is a good wake-up call because they have various aides who are employed to do this work.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd their laws must not target individuals or group of individuals. They must be laws that will improve governance and not be made for certain people to have an advantage over others.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, the whole of this primary that is going on is a mess. If you know the standard practice, you will ask teachers here to score this primaries and it cannot get more than 25 per cent and you cannot use that process to elect the president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe process is already failed and it is not good for this country. Yes , we will manage and move on and I pray that good people should emerge, but we hope that what has happened this 2022 will not happen again in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

This licensing follows a visit to Nigeria by the company\u2019s team in May last year to discuss the possibility of obtaining a licence. Starlink which currently operates in 36 countries has over 400,000 subscribers around the world.\n\n\u201cThe company received two licenses, which include the International Gateway license and Internet Service Provider (ISP) license, and will be trading as Starlink Internet Services Nigeria Ltd. According to NCC, the International Gateway license has a 10-year tenure while the ISP license is to last for five years. Both licenses take effect from May 2022 and may be renewed after the expiration,\u201d per Nairametrics.\n\nStarlink approved by Nigeria \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec & Mozambique \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddffhttps://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2022\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas. It is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nStarlink enters a Nigerian Internet service provider space that is dominated by telcos like MTN and Airtel, as well as individual ISPs such as Spectranet, SMILE and others.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink is a more expensive option costing $599 (~\u20a6330,000) for a full kit, including a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, then a $110 (~\u20a660,500) for preorder and monthly subscription. Its premium service costs about $2,500 (~\u20a61.375 million) for the full kit and $500 (~\u20a6275,000) monthly.\n\nThis price range is deemed expensive for the average Nigerian, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nShare this article",

It\u2019s also the ideal time to bill that tech bro or sis.\n\nThis type of weekend only occurs once a month. If you miss it this month, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to wait. Just kidding. No, I\u2019m not .\n\nBy the way, today is Children\u2019s Day in Nigeria. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to fulfil that promise to take them out or buy that ice cream. \ud83d\ude09 I mean, make a child happy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m also following my advice and billing you. Just kidding. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do this weekend, but I know it will be fun.\n\nEnjoy your weekend however you can. You know I\u2019m always concerned with your overall health and wellbeing. Take care of yourself during this short break!!!\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to talk about two stories:\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\nProducts for people with disabilities\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that Jumia is one of the dominant players in the African eCommerce market. In Nigeria, the company made $33 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with a $14.6 million increase in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted it a Payment Service Solution Provider (PSSP) licence.\n\nThe licence will enable it to process payments for Nigerian third-party businesses. This development pits it directly against Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita.\n\nIt also provides an additional revenue stream when the company desperately needs to increase revenue.\n\nInterestingly, the company is testing a healthtech play through a partnership with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collaboration will provide users with access to doctors for a $1 monthly subscription fee.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim thinks it\u2019s a fantastic move that will allow Jumia to leverage its existing customer base and infrastructure.\n\nI do not think we have enough doctors in this country, though. I mean, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one doctor for every 600 people in a country.\n\nHowever, in a country with one doctor for every 5,000 people, the WHO\u2019s recommendation appears a long way off.\n\nFurther, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria.\n\nIn his article, Chimgozirim discusses what the collaboration could mean for healthtech startups. You can find it here: Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!\n\nKenya\u2019s digital products for people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report, approximately 40% of Africa\u2019s population is disabled, including 10-15% of school-age children. This implies that there are over 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.\n\nEven though people with disabilities are often referred to as the world\u2019s largest minority, in Africa, they face exclusion, discrimination, and barriers to exercising their fundamental rights and participating in development.\n\nHowever, Kenya, an African country, is changing the narrative.\n\nHow? Kenya has developed a standard for digital accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nThis means that people with disabilities, and older people who are largely disconnected from most e-government services and business-owned digital platforms, will be connected, supported, and empowered by digital products to increase their digital inclusion.\n\nHow? It will be accomplished by providing computer assistive technology to the blind and visually impaired. Also, public and private sector digital products and services (like websites and mobile applications) will be more accessible and usable by all Kenyan citizens.\n\nThis follows the announcement by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of a partnership with inABLE to develop a national information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility standard.\n\nThis is similar to EnableMe Kenya, an online platform, aimed at providing community-oriented technological support and increasing digital inclusion for people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to Bernard Njiraini, KEBS Managing Director, \u201cTo accommodate all people in the society, inclusive design and universal design principles should be integrated into digital products and services.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer.

          "title": "Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Abdullahi Fawale\n\nShort answer? Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

          "title": "INEC extends deadline for primaries by one week",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended the June 3 deadline for the conduct of primary election by political parties for about one week, shifting the new date to June 9, 2022.\n\nFestus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee announced this in statement on Friday after earlier meeting with the political where the request was made.\n\nOkoye said the Commission did not schedule any specific activity during the period between June 3 and 9, hence the request was granted the political parties.\n\nThe full statement read:\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met with the leadership of political parties today Friday 27th May 2022. Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 General Election released on Saturday 26th February 2022.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The Commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the 6-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal. The Commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\u201d\n\n*The INEC Candidates Nomination Portal*\n\n\u201cAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the Commission, based on past experience, has decided to train the political party officials to make efficient and effective use of the portal. The Commission will train four officials from each of the 18 political parties, making a total of 72 in all.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some of the political parties are still yet to submit their nominees for the training. The Commission hereby reminds such parties to do so immediately. The Commission wishes to reiterate that only electronically submitted nominations will be processed.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are therefore advised to ensure that their primaries are free of rancour in order to meet the timelines for the remaining activities embodied in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the meeting, Yabagi Sani, chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) appealed for a little adjustment in the timelines for election to enable the political parties conduct seamless primary election for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 polls.\n\nSani said IPAC had written a letter to INEC immediately after an interactive session with the Commission and requested that it should take a second look at the timetable which is tight considering that the Electoral Act 2022 will be used for the first time, and there are bound to be mistakes.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe feel that if we are given more time, we\u2019ll be able to deliver on the promise of having a free and fair elections as we conduct our primaries.\n\n\u201cThis meeting is coming on the heels of the meeting which the leaders of political parties had, where we unanimously considered it very important to seek review\u2026we are asking you to consider and give us a little adjustment in the timetable to enable carry out this very important assignment.\u201d\n\nAlso, Dan Nwanyanwu, National Chairman of the Zenith Labour Party specifically requested that political parties should be given the window between June 3 and 9 to put their house in order.\n\nNwanyanwu said: \u201cThe window he (Sani) is talking about which we want to put before you to consider and plead with you has to do with what happens between the June 3 when primaries would have ended and up to June 9 that we will start uploading what we got from the primaries.\n\n\u201cWhat we are pleading for is nothing but to allow the parties window because during this time nothing is happening, is just for the parties to start preparing their documentation. So if it please the Commission allow us between 3rd and 9th so that the political parties can put their house together.\n\n\u201cWe asked for 30 days you refused us, we asked for two months, you refused us. All the things we asked you refused us. I think this one will not affect the timetable. It will not shift the date of election. It will not do anything. We just need this window so that those things we have not done, we can technically take them up to that time when we are preparing our documentation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before the meeting went into closed door, Mahmood Yakubu INEC Chairman said IPAC\u2019s current request was different from the earlier ones so the Commission would meet after the interface and issued a statement conveying its decision.\n\nYakubu said: We just heard from the chairman of IPAC who on behalf of the political parties has once again requested for a review of our election timelines.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the proposition this time around is different from the request made earlier for which the Commission has responded emphatically.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, the request the last time was for an extension of between 37 and 60 days. On these, the position of the Commission has not changed. Such a request will not be entertained in view of the overlapping activities contained in the timeline and schedule of activities already released and published.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the parties have now presented a more defined request for what the chairman calls a little adjustment. We will now discuss further to understand the basis for requesting this little adjustment and thereafter, the Commission will meet and a statement will be issued.\u201d",

In line with this, Enageed developed this initiative with the objective to improve the capacity of local community contractors and ensure their businesses continue to grow,\u201d Menkiti said\n\nSpeaking on the local capacity development initiative, the company Head of Supply Chain Management, Mr. Frank Emerua, said Enageed has put in extra efforts to properly engage with the community to facilitate their social license to ensure the safety of people and facilities, improve production and promote the sustainable development of all host communities thereby fostering economic growth.\n\nHe also stated that Enageed developed this initiative with the objective to improve the capacity of local community contractors and ensure their businesses continue to grow.\n\nEmerua explained that the theme \u201cConnecting our Communities to Endless Opportunities\u201d assumes significance, as Enageed believes that building human and social capital is a never-ending act and is integral to strategic community investments.\n\n\u201cEnageed is aware millions of people around the country still live in abject poverty without access to basic amenities, employment, health care, and education, Enageed is deliberate about the development of our communities. Enageed has gathered a rich combination of speakers who would be providing key lessons on fundamental 21st-century skills. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is critical in all sectors of the world\u2019s economy and is changing the way we live, work and do business.\n\n\u201cTo ensure community contractors have the right skills for an increasingly digital and globalized world, the ICT session which is a key component of this training would bridge that gap.\n\n\u201cAnother key component of the training is financial literacy which matters across many levels of our world economy. As such, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of financial literacy and inclusion. This session would ensure our contractors are more knowledgeable about finance in a way that is relevant to their business.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that the company\u2019s commitment to promoting healthy environment, has also led to the medical check-up which is being conducted for members of the community as safety and health is at the heart of its operation.\n\n\u201cEnageed is hopeful that this session will enlighten the community on how to stay healthy and will provide relief for people requiring eyeglasses and other basic health needs like hypertension, blood sugar and other health issues.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to ensure continuous development in the communities we operate in, and believe the skills learned and knowledge gained will better equip community contractors to improve the efficiency of their operations and grow their businesses. We therefore look forward to the future outcome of this training that will foster innovation and better economic development in the Ajoki Community,\u201d he declared.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Secretary General of Ajoki Community, Scott Omesan, thanked Sahara Group for coming up with the initiative to foster better relationship between it and the host Community.\n\nOmesan promised that as a Community, \u201cwe shall do everything possible to protect the company\u2019s facilities in our domain.\u201d\n\nHe also added: \u201cWe also expect cooperation with the company for it to follow local content policy and best practices. There are some job the community can do. We are not going to struggle for jobs we cannot do.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s programme has given us the opportunity to learn more about ICT. Also, the medical outreach has afforded a lot of our people the opportunity to know their health statuses in the area of eye problem and others. Even the contractors among us, the programme will afford them the opportunity to know more as growing contractors and not to depend on the bigger contractors. So having such thing in Ajoki Community, I think the relationship between us and the company will continue to be cordial.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

It commences from Apama Road, stretches through the hilly terrains of Edo State, and terminates at Okpekpe (Auchi).\n\n\u201cThe Okpekpe 10km International Road Race does not only give indigenous sportsmen the opportunity to participate in a race of international standards, but it also affords them long-distance endurance and high-altitude training needed to compete in prominent events on the global stage,\u201d said Tobiloba Obawede, Brand Manager, Amstel Malta Ultra.\n\n\u201cAsides from the immense benefits to the sports community, the Okpekpe community which serves as the host reaps economic benefits as well.

The Commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the 6-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal. The Commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cHowever, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries.\n\n\u201cAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the Commission, based on past experience, has decided to train the political party officials to make efficient and effective use of the portal. The Commission will train four officials from each of the 18 political parties, making a total of 72 in all.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some of the political parties are still yet to submit their nominees for the training. The Commission hereby reminds such parties to do so immediately. The Commission wishes to reiterate that only electronically submitted nominations will be processed.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are therefore advised to ensure that their primaries are free of rancour in order to meet the timelines for the remaining activities embodied in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election.\u201d",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has eventually agreed to extend the deadline given for various political parties to conduct primaries ahead of 2023 general elections.\n\nA press statement by the commission\u2019s Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, on Saturday said the political parties now has between June 4 and 9, 2022 to conduct and conclude primaries.\n\nRead the full statement\n\n\n\nINDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nPARTY PRIMARIES AND SUBMISSION OF LIST OF NOMINATED CANDIDATES\n\nParty Primaries\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met with the leadership of political parties today Friday 27th May 2022. Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 General Election released on Saturday 26th February 2022.\n\nEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The Commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\nHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the six-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal. The Commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\nThe Commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct. However, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries.\n\nThe INEC Candidates Nomination Portal\n\nAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\nIn addition, the Commission, based on past experience, has decided to train the political party officials to make efficient and effective use of the portal. The Commission will train four officials from each of the 18 political parties, making a total of 72 in all.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the political parties are still yet to submit their nominees for the training. The Commission hereby reminds such parties to do so immediately. The Commission wishes to reiterate that only electronically submitted nominations will be processed.\n\nPolitical parties are therefore advised to ensure that their primaries are free of rancour in order to meet the timelines for the remaining activities embodied in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election.\n\nFestus Okoye\n\nChairman, Information and Voter Education Committee\n\nFriday 27th May 2022\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026APC May 29 special convention shaky\u2019 \u2026NWC members still in the dark \u2013 Source \u2026Pro-Tinubu women warn on imposition\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa state capital, has ruled that former President Goodluck Jonathan was eligible to run for president in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nThe presiding judge, Justice Isa Hamma Dashen, gave the judgement on Friday.\n\nHe also held that Jonathan\u2019s right to vie for the office of president again \u201ccannot be stopped by any retroactive law.\u201d\n\nLagos lawyer Femi Falana had declared that Jonathan was ineligible to run for another term having been sworn in twice and served out the remaining term of the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, but the Law and Order Group disagreed over the eligibility of Jonathan to run for president in 2023.\n\nWhile Falana insisted that Jonathan cannot run by virtue of Section 137 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, the Law and Order Group disputed Falana\u2019s assertion.\n\nFalana, in a statement, said the former President has been disqualified by virtue of Section 137 (3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIt has been confirmed that former President Goodluck Jonathan has decided to join the APC for the purpose of contesting the 2023 presidential election. However, the former president is disqualified from contesting the election by virtue of Section 137 (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, which provides as follows:\n\n\u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\n\n\u201cSome people have said that the amendment is not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Dr. Jonathan. Assuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than two terms of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years. In Marwa v. Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.1296) 199 at 387 the Supreme Court stated that Section 180 (1) and (2)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has prescribed a single term of 4 years and if a second term, another period of 4 years and not a day longer.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Governor Ladoja v INEC (2008)40 WRN 1 the Supreme Court rejected the prayer of Governor Ladoja for 11 months\u2019 extension to cover the period he was kept out of office through illegal impeachment. The Supreme Court rejected the prayer on the ground that a governor is entitled to spend a maximum period of eight years or less and not more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umoru Yar\u2019Adua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent five years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. The reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of four years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years.\u201d\n\nBut the Law and Order Group, in a statement by its coordinator, Aliyu Mohammed, said: \u201cWe wish to categorically state that the said statement is erroneous and misconceived. In the first place, the 4th Alteration to the Constitution which introduced Section 137(3) was signed into law as part of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) by President Muhammadu Buhari on June 7, 2018.\n\n\u201cThe said Section 137 (3) contains a commencement date which is the date it was signed into law. Thus, the provisions of Section 137(3) of the 1999 Constitution (4th Alteration) became operative on June 7, 2018, and not any time before that date.\n\n\u201cThe law is settled beyond controversy or dispute that a law does not take effect retroactively. Again, it is the law that, where a piece of legislation sets out a specific commencement date, as in the case of Section 137 (3), all rights, duties, obligations, and interests created or intended to be created or imposed by that law will not be applicable to rights, events or duties which accrued or occurred before then. The case of Modu vs. FRN (2015) LPELR 4047 is very apt.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, Jonathan left office in 2015. The oaths of office that he took were taken prior to the enactment of Section 137(3). In a case decided by the Court of Appeal in 2015, the court rightly held that the oath of office sworn to by Jonathan on May 6, 2010, cannot be taken into account in the interpretation of Section 137(1) of the Constitution. It follows, therefore, that the only oath of office sworn by Jonathan is the one he took on May 29, 2011.\n\n\u201cAgain, it is not in dispute that Jonathan contested the presidential election in 2015 on the basis of the right which accrued to him. It follows, therefore, that Jonathan has the right to contest the forthcoming presidential election on the platform of any of the registered political parties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny contrary position will be manifestly inconsistent with the provision of the Constitution which grants him the right to contest for any elective office in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThere were, however, speculations in various quarters that the party might be considering a former President Goodluck Jonathan as its flag-bearer.\n\nA Fulani group had obtained nomination forms for the former President, but Jonathan through a statement by his spokesman described the move as \u201can insult\u201d to him.\n\nIn a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president disowned the group that bought the forms for him and urged members of the public to disregard them.\n\nThe statement had read in part, \u201cIt has come to our notice that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the name of former President Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n\u201cWe wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. We want to state that if the former President wanted to contest an election, he would make his intentions clear to the public and would not enter through the back door.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 Presidential election, we wish to state that he has not in any way committed himself to this request. \u201cBuying a presidential aspiration form in the name Dr. Jonathan without his consent, knowing the position he had held in this country, is considered an insult to his person. The general public is, therefore, advised to disregard it.\u201d\n\nAlthough an online media (not Blueprint) reported that the former President properly submitted the nomination forms bought for him secretly, it was not, however, clear whether the Bayelsa state-born politician had even joined the ruling party or not.\n\nShaky presidential primary\n\nMeanwhile, there is palpable confusion on whether or not the special convention slated for May 29 to elect the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the 2023 general elections will still be held.\n\nBlueprint reported Friday on the lack of preparations towards the said Sunday Convention of the ruling party.\n\nIt was further gathered that the lack of information and the body language of the presidency was responsible for the slow nature of the preparations to elect the party\u2019s flag-bearer.\n\nA reliable source in the party\u2019s national secretariat told our correspondent that \u201ceven the national officers (NWC members) cannot tell you the true position of things for now, because they too don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTinubu support group\u2019s appeals\n\nIn a related development, a group of women who are supporters of one of the presidential aspirants, Bola Tinubu, has appealed to the national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, to ensure transparency and allow party delegates to choose a candidate of their choice at the forthcoming primary without any form of intimidation.\n\nThe group, under the aegis of Ondo state Women for Tinubu, also called on all APC delegates to ensure they elect the person of their choice as the presidential candidate without any harassment.\n\nThe leader of the group, Mrs. Bola Ige, in a statement issued Friday, said although there was a provision for a consensus candidate in the constitution, it should be a true consensus whereby all the aspirants would sign a written document \u201cto show they all agree to it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, there was a need to ensure transparency and allow party members to choose a candidate of their choice at the primary.\n\nThe group, while condemning what it termed \u201can attempt in some quarters to compel the delegates to vote for a particular candidate,\u201d urged the party leaders to desist from such an act and give all aspirants a level-playing ground.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of justice, equity and fair play, our great party should allow all the presidential aspirants to go for the primary. Let the people determine who will be their president,\u201d Ige said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

That was why my campaign set sail on a democratic journey that took us to all the nooks and crannies of our dear state.\u201d\n\nBelow are Abaribe\u2019s letters conveying his resignation from the PDP as well as the Senate Minority Leader\u2019s post:",

Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 General Election released on Saturday 26th February 2022.\n\nEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The Commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\nHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the 6-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal. The Commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\nThe Commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct. However, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries.\n\nThe INEC Candidates Nomination Portal\n\nAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.",

David Mark, Chairman of the PDP Special Convention, Anyim lamented that he had gone through the list of delegates from other states and the FCT but could not find that of Ebonyi State delegates.\n\nSen.

Goodfellas will always be my favourite movie.\u201d\n\nBatman regret\n\nBy the 90s, Liotta was starring in Unlawful Entry, Cop Land and Corrina, Corrina with Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nLast year he starred in the Sopranos prequel film The Many Saints Of Newark,having turned down a role in the original series.\n\nThe New Jersey-born actor said in 2016 that he regretted turning down the chance to audition for Tim Burton\u2019s Batman film.\n\n\u201cWhen I did my first movie, Tim Burton was getting ready to do Batman and he was interested in me because he wanted it to be edgy and real.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Batman? That\u2019s a stupid idea\u2019, even though he had just done one of my favourite movies of all time, Beetlejuice. So yes, I regret not auditioning for that\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe also played lawyer Jay Marotta in the critically acclaimed 2019 film Marriage Story, which starred Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a couple whose relationship was breaking up. Laura Dern won a best supporting actress Oscar for playing a lawyer in the film.\n\nThe actor had recently finished working on the 2023 film The Cocaine Bear, directed by Elizabeth Banks\n\nLiotta also narrated documentary series The Making Of The Mob, and appeared in several music videos including David Guetta\u2019s song Lovers On The Sun.",
