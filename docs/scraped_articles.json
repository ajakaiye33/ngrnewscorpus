          "text": "The presidential flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Monday, left the country for France.\n\nTinubu departed Nigeria shortly after he held a closed-door meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, in the morning.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by Tinubu\u2019s Spokesman, Tunde Rahman, in Abuja.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cHe is off to Paris, France to hold some important meetings. The APC standard-bearer is expected back in the country shortly.\u201d\n\nThe development is coming in the wake of Tinubu\u2019s statement on Sunday that he was still searching for his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAlthough Rahman did not state how long the former Lagos State Governor would be away, there were insinuations that his travel must have something to do with the consultation for his running mate.\n\nThe development is coming in the wake of controversy over Tinubu\u2019s claims that he lost his academic certificates in his submission to the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nThe national leader of the APC stated that he was still studying how the House of Representatives Speaker, Hakeem Gbajabiamila and the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, had been working harmoniously, in his search for a running mate.\n\nHe said this at the presentation of a book titled \u2018Mr Speaker: The Legislative Life, Service and Resilience of Femi Gbajabiamila and the unveiling of a Legislative Mentorship Initiative to mark the senator\u2019s 60th birthday.\n\nThe PUNCH reported that the northern governors of the APC from the North-West and North-East were divided over the choice of a suitable running mate for the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Tinubu.\n\nA party chieftain, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The PUNCH that the delay in settling for an acceptable candidate among the governors spurred the party to temporarily opt for a placeholder.\n\nThe APC had submitted the name of a party chieftain in Katsina State, Ibrahim Masari, to the Independent National Electoral Commission as its surrogate running mate.\n\nMasari is a serving board member of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies in Kuru, Plateau State.\n\nThe source told one of our correspondents that nine days after Masari\u2019s name was submitted to the INEC, the APC had yet to settle for a candidate.",

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) Peter Obi has come under criticism over his aspiration to win the presidency.\n\nMany have argued that Obi, who is faced with too many hurdles, lacks the alliance formation across political divides and standard political structures across Nigeria.\n\nSome others mocked Obi and his army of independent volunteers \u2013 \u2018Obi-dient Movement\u2019 for leading in various polls on social media and online platforms instead of creating physical presence in remote areas of the country especially the north.\n\nIn all of these criticisms, some prominent persons in the country\u2019s political circle have said the former Anambra Governor would never be president of the country in 2023.\n\nObi, seen as an \u2018underdog\u2019, will slug it out with candidates of the two major parties: Asiwaju Bola Tinubu (All Progressives Congress) and Atiku Abubakar (Peoples Democratic Party).\n\nOthers are: Dumebi Kachikwu (African Democratic Congress); Prince Malik Ado-Ibrahim (Young Progressives Party); Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (New Nigeria Peoples\u2019 Party), Prince Adewole Adeboye (Social Democratic Party (SDP); Omoyele Sowore (African Action Congress); Kola Abiola (Peoples\u2019 Redemption Party); Peter Umeadi (All Progressives Grand Alliance); Dan Nwanyanwu (Zenith Labour Party); Christopher Imumolen (Accord Party) and Maj. Hamza Mustapha (Action Alliance).\n\nTo many other observers, Obi\u2019s supporters are also jeopardising his aspiration because of their hateful comments, and always hurling abusive and insulting words at anyone who campaigns for their candidate.\n\nThese are prominent individuals who have spoken against Obi\u2019s candidacy:\n\nBabangida Aliyu\n\nFormer Niger Governor Babangida Aliyu said Obi is a good candidate but 2023 would be too early for him to make it.\n\nAliyu said: \u201cPeter Obi is my good friend and a former member of my former Governors forum. A very excellent person.\n\n\u201cHis candidature, in terms of the Presidency, \u2013 I think he will make some name now. But he may be able to make it only in 2027, 2031. But 2023? Too early.\n\n\u201cEven though the young people might go for him, the name is not dropping everywhere else. I doubt if Nigerians are ready for him now as a presidential person.\n\n\u201cI would have loved him as a Vice President. Many of us were rooting for him to be Vice President to Atiku again.\u201d\n\nNed Nwoko\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Delta North, Prince Ned Nwoko declared Obi cannot win the 2023 presidency.\n\nHe advised the former Anambra Governor to return to the PDP and pick a ministerial appointment.\n\nThe former House of Representatives member said Peter Obi\u2019s current party lacks the structure to produce the presidency despite his seemingly large support base.\n\nHe eulogised Obi, describing him as a very \u2018frugal and conservative\u2019 in his dealings while he was Governor.\n\n\u201cPeople Obi is a good man, I\u2019ve known him for many years. When I did my Paris club refund for Anambra State, he impressed me.\n\n\u201cHe impressed me because he will actually pick the phone to arrange my flight. He will pick his phone to book my hotel. And he was the governor.\n\n\u201cHe actually came to London and didn\u2019t come like other governors that came to see me, to give me instructions. He came alone, carrying his bag.\n\n\u201cWe will like him back in the PDP. I would want to be one of those that\u2019ll encourage him to come back to PDP. We can have him.\u201d\n\nFather Mbaka\n\nFiery Catholic Priest, Ejike Mbaka, had said the former Anambra Governor will never be President in 2023 or anytime later.\n\nMbaka said the Labour Party (LB) presidential candidate is a \u201cstingy man\u201d and that it was better to have an \u201cold generous man\u201d as president than a \u201cstingy young man\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is now that Atiku (Abubakar) is contesting for president. Now that he is contesting without Peter Obi, it is now that he is serious. We want somebody that is serious. Unless Peter Obi comes here to kneel, if he becomes President, I will close down this ministry. He is going nowhere,\u201d Mbaka said\n\nMany Nigerians, including the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, criticised him over his comment.\n\nAlthough Rev. Mbaka has backtracked and apologised to Obi, and his supporters for the comment, his initial scathing remarks about Obi appears timely and will be in the public domain for long.\n\nIke Ekweremadu\n\nFormer Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu said that people from the South-East will not vote for Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi.\n\nThe lawmaker from Enugu state acknowledged that Peter Obi is a credible candidate but that the South-East needs to be dynamic and should not waste their votes on Peter Obi because he can\u2019t win the presidential election.\n\nDavid Umahi\n\nEbonyi Governor David Umahi asked indigenes of the State to obtain their Permanent Voters Card (PVC) and vote for the Presidential Flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu.\n\nUmahi told the residents not to vote for Obi.\n\n\u201cOur party is APC and not the Labour Party. We will not vote for the Labour Party. We will vote for APC.\n\n\u201cThe States that the Labour Party has helped should vote for them.\n\n\u201cThe agenda of God for Ebonyi state is Ebonyi state agenda and that is what you should be telling them when they come to ask you, will you vote for. Tell them not to look for our votes, our votes belong to APC\u201d, he added.\n\nChukwuma Soludo\n\nAnambra Governor Chukwuma Soludo has said those dreaming to win the 2023 general elections under new parties are jokers.\n\nHe specifically said those who joined the Labour Party (LP) like its presidential candidate, Peter Obi, will just labour in vain in 2023.\n\nThe Governor said a party without a councillor has nothing to offer.",

This seeming silence they quipped, does not in any way reassure Nigerians that the government is on top of the situation.\n\nIn a release signed by the President of the association, Very Rev. Fr.

Christopher Odia of Auchi Dioceses and Bitrus Borigo of Kaduna Archdiocese, including the killing of over 40 worshippers at Owo, Ondo State, respectively, the group wondered why the bandits have suddenly picked interest in harassing, and killing harmless clergy and innocent worshippers who pose no danger or obstacle to anyone, rather than their desire to draw nearer their creator.\n\nThey implored the security agencies at the federal and state levels and across all formations to intensify efforts to bring the killers to book, while also intensifying efforts to safeguard the lives of the citizens.\n\nSIGNIS Nigeria equally challenged the legislative arm of government across all levels to explore the possibility of enacting a law that would enable Nigerians to own arms to defend themselves and their families against arbitrary attacks by gunmen as is now being championed by the Zamfara State government.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Desmond Mgboh, Kano and Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nWeeks after Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former Lagos State governor emerged as presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), intrigues and infightings within the party has stalled efforts to select his substantive running mate.\n\nTinubu had chosen a placeholder, Kabiru Masari, in order to beat the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). However, the choice of a substantive running mate has proved Herculean given mounting pressure by northern governors under the party platform to have him cede the position to one of them.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that though President Muhammadu Buhari had instructed the leadership of the party, led by its national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to steer clear and allow Tinubu the free hand to select his running mate, the governors are unwilling to concede that right to the presidential flag bearer.\n\nIt was also learnt that Tinubu\u2019s headache is further compounded by the growing opposition to his planned Muslim-Muslim ticket by Northern Christians and the leaderships of various churches in Nigeria. The APC presidential flag bearer, it was learnt, has however narrowed his option to the North East and North West.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the development, however, said Tinubu in recent weeks has been having a running battle with northern governors, believed to have worked for him during the presidential primary, who are insisting he must honour the gentleman agreement to pick one of them as running mate.\n\nA source said Tinubu was in a dilemma that the governors may work against him if he failed to honour the agreement reached with them ahead of the primary to pick one of them as his substantive running mate.\n\nOne of the sources who hails from the North East and who doesn\u2019t want to be named because he\u2019s not authorised to speak, said there is also the dilemma of choosing between the North West and North East which also explains why the party candidate is yet to name his vice.\n\nHe said beside the governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, the other two APC governors from the North East, are unwilling to risk their second term tickets for the position.\n\n\u201cTinubu has been given the free hands to pick a running mate. From what we\u2019ve seen, he will possibly settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Many party leaders are against this option, including President Buhari. But since Buhari has also instructed that Tinubu should be allowed to pick his running mate, he has no choice, but to respect his choice. But governors from the North who are APC members, are not willing to give up that position. They\u2019re insisting that a running mate should be produced by them.\n\n\u201cIf Tinubu must win in the North, he needs these governors. If he ignores them and picks someone outside their circle, there will be trouble. But the issues are beyond that. North West has six APC governors and the highest in the party. The geopolitical zone also has the highest number of registered voters. That gives them the bargaining power.\n\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re dictating and pushing that a governor from the geopolitical zone be picked. But North Central is equally important. But it appears that Tinubu isn\u2019t unwilling to gamble with votes from the North West and that\u2019s part of the reasons why the party has no substantive running mate right now,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source lamented that the leadership of APC that should have handled this critical assignment had been completely sidelined.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t recommend or decide; it has become a toothless bulldog. I\u2019m aware that Tinubu has given a deadline within which governors and other leaders from the North will recommend at least three names to him. Tinubu is then expected to pick from these names. Whether or not the governors will shift their selfish positions and carry others along, time will tell,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022I\u2019m still searching \u2013Tinubu\n\nTinubu, yesterday, said he was still searching for a running mate. The former Lagos State governor, who spoke at the public presentation of the book: \u201cMr Speaker\u201d in honour of Femi Gbajabiamila, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, however, did not say to what extent he had gone in the search.\n\nDirector of Media and Communications, Bola Ahmed Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Mr. Bayo Onanuga, in a chat with Daily Sun, confirmed that Tinubu is still consulting.\n\nHe said the APC presidential candidate cannott do the selection alone.\n\n\u201cTinubu isn\u2019t having any issues with Northern APC governors or in any fix. He\u2019s consulting with the party and will decide soon. So, there\u2019s no problem at all,\u201d he said.\n\nAPC spokesman, Felix Morka, did not respond to calls or a message from our correspondent on the issue.\n\n\u2022It\u2019ll be suicidal to pick Christian running mate \u2013Yakasai\n\nElder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, has warned that it would be politically suicidal for Tinubu to pick a Christian as running mate.\n\nLending his voice to the push for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, Yakasai said If Tinubu should pick a Christian, whether from the North or South, majority of voters in the Muslim North may move their support for Atiku.\n\nHe said a Muslim northerner would strengthen Tunibu\u2019s hold on votes of Muslims.\n\nYakasai implored Tinubu to pick a credible Muslim from the North East arguing that the zone has had the least presence in the corridor of power compared to the North Central and North West.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that by the time he completes his own tenure, it would naturally pave the way for the North-East to produce the next president,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued that despite the opposition by some Christians, including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the idea of a Muslim-Muslim ticket was not new in Nigeria, saying it has been deployed in the past with considerable success.\n\nYakasai recalled that MKO Abiola appointed Babagana Kingibe, a fellow Muslim as his running mate in the1993 presidential elections and were well received by Nigerians, who voted massively for them at the polls.\n\n\u2022Lalong: I\u2019m not desperate\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has dismissed reports of abandoning the state to lobby for the vice presidential slot in Lagos.\n\nHis media aide, Makut Macham, said he had never been desperate for any elective or political position.\n\n\u201cIf God says he will be the next vice president Nigeria, nobody can stop it. It is up to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the APC family to decide. Lalong together with his colleagues have done their part in insisting that power goes to the South. Let everyone remember that it is God who gives power to whomsoever he pleases. No amount of paid propaganda can change anything. Head or tail, Lalong wins,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also refuted the claim that the governor was spending billions of the state\u2019s funds for the said endeavour.\n\nHe said the story was \u201canchored completely on a fathom anonymous source that provided wonderfully packaged fiction and lies claiming that Governor Simon Lalong abandoned governance in Plateau State and relocated to Lagos in search of being nominated as Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\u201d\n\nHe said Lalong has not been to Lagos in the last couple of months, the last, being the inauguration of the Dangote Fertilizer Plant and new Murtala Mohammed International Airport Terminal by President Muhammadu Buhari and attended by many governors.\n\n\u201cWe wonder where the so-called \u201csource\u201d got his imagination from about Governor Lalong relocating to Lagos, but could not provide the date, time, mode of movement or address where he allegedly relocated to in Lagos. Of course, he cannot provide such details because they do not exist even in his fictional contraption.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Don\u2019t sell fuel above N165/litre, IPMAN, ADITOP warn members, appoint consultants to recover debts\n\n\u2022Nigeria\u2019s problem is distribution, not supply, PENGASSAN declares\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Emma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nAs petrol scarcity in Lagos, Abuja, and other cities persists, petroleum products marketers under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) have said the most viable solution to the supply and distribution challenges is full deregulation of the downstream oil and gas sector.\n\nThe suggestion came as the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) and the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), yesterday, warned their members against selling petrol above the government approved price of N165 per litre.\n\nThe oil marketers made the remark a day after President Muhammadu Buhari said his government suspended the petrol subsidy removal because it was not in the country\u2019s best interest. Buhari, who said this in an interview on Bloomberg, stressed that while removing subsidy looked good on paper, the human consequences could not be ignored. Although his administration was on the verge of removing petrol subsidy last year, Buhari said it became inadvisable after inputs from industry experts and other economic factors were considered. He said issues around petrol subsidy would be resolved through on-going efforts at boosting local refining, especially through private sector involvement.\n\nNevertheless, National President of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), Mr. Festus Osifo, yesterday, insisted that Nigeria had enough stock of petrol, despite the scarcity in various parts of the country. Osifo, who spoke on a national television programme, maintained that Nigeria\u2019s major problem was with the distribution of petroleum products. He said the tanker drivers were not loading as much products as they should because of pending issues around the \u201cbridging fund.\u201d\n\nAnalysts had warned that the federal government\u2019s inability to take the tough decision on the subsidy issue was bound to have massive consequences for the overall implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The implementation of the PIA, which requires the removal of petrol subsidy, ought to have commenced in February 2022, but it was shifted to July 2022.\n\nHowever, due to pressure and threats of protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the decision on subsidy removal was suspended to next year. There are concerns that due to political considerations, it might not be implemented till 2023.\n\nBut in a statement yesterday, MOMAN stressed that urgent and full implementation of the PIA 2021, as regards full deregulation of the downstream sector to allow market forces determine the prices of products, especially petrol, was the way out of the frequent product shortages and attendant hardships on Nigerians.\n\nThe MOMAN statement was issued in Lagos at the end of its virtual press conference, which was jointly signed by its Chairman, Mr. Olumide Adeosun, and Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Clement Isong.\n\n\u201cThe full deregulation of the petroleum downstream sector and full implementation of the PIA 2021 clearly remains the most viable long-term solution to the country\u2019s supply and distribution challenges,\u201d it added.\n\nThe association also empathised with customers of its member companies, as it continued to grapple with recurrent scarcity of petrol in various parts of the country. It said the current scarcity of petrol was occasioned by two main reasons, namely, supply inadequacy in the last few weeks, and distribution challenges created by the unavailability and continuous surge in international prices of diesel.\n\nMOMAN said its members were working with the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited through its marketing arm, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), the National Association of Road Transport Operators (NARTO), and other industry stakeholders to make petrol available at the pumps and eliminate the queues as quickly as possible.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cMOMAN, as an association, fears that the current supply framework cannot guarantee steady and consistent supplies to the country, given the current state of government finances and unpredictable international supply shortages.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, recommend a gradual price deregulation with targeted palliatives (eg. transport and agricultural subsidies) to the public to ease implementation.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the interim, MOMAN recommends: the current single supplier strategy be reviewed; the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and other relevant MDAs, should set up a taskforce to immediately focus on increasing diesel supply through accelerated initiatives to increase local modular refining capacity.\u201d\n\nThe marketers\u2019 union noted that the suggestions proffered would tackle the supply and distribution challenges, adding that the phased rehabilitation of existing NNPC refineries would hasten supply of middle distillates: diesel and aviation fuel.\n\nThe statement further said, \u201cMOMAN recognises and closely associates with the need to ease challenges with respect to high energy and transportation costs occasioned by extraneous circumstances.\n\n\u201cMOMAN shall continually do its best to distribute petrol to its customers across the country and keep exploring opportunities to partner with industry stakeholders, the Authority, and the Government to ensure the sustainability and institutionalisation of a viable petroleum downstream sector in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Sell Fuel Above N165/litre, IPMAN, ADITOP Warn Members\n\nADITOP and IPMAN warned their members against selling petrol above the government-approved price of N165 per litre. The bodies gave the warning in Abuja, following reports that IPMAN in Lagos State had directed their members to start selling fuel at N180 per litre.\n\nIPMAN National President, Chinedu Okoronkwo, told journalists in Abuja that his members had earlier briefed him on why they wanted a price hike. Okoronkwo said the federal government had released enough fuel from its depot, which would enable them \u201cto maintain the status quo antebellum\u201d.\n\nOkoronkwo also said the unions had engaged the services of Benham Group to recover money owed them for the supply of petroleum products. He expressed the hope that the partnership would help in ending fuel scarcity at the filling station.\n\nOkoronkwo said, \u201cOur business requires technology, that is why we brought a seasoned financial expert and we\u2019ve been able to recover a lot of funds in other countries and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe incessant mishaps and destruction of trucks on the road, banditry and kidnapping is the reason we are bringing the insurance company to help us.\n\n\u201cLeaving the risk for the owner of the truck to bear will affect our businesses.\u201d\n\nOkoronkwo maintained that petrol must be sold at N165 per litre since the federal government had released fuel from the depot.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur members in Lagos were getting the fuel at N170 -N173 that\u2019s why they wanted price increased.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the Nigerian National Petroleum Company that is importing the product.\n\n\u201cThe cost of doing business had changed, so it becomes difficult to sell at N165 per litre.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are thanking the NNPC for bringing the product to N143. So, our members must sell the product at N165, which is the government-approved price.\u201d\n\nNational President, Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products in Nigeria (ADITOP), Alhaji Mohammed Danzaki, also said Nigerians had suffered a lot from fuel scarcity because of the problems the association faced.\n\nDanzaki said, \u201cADITOP and IPMAN are the ones suffering, since we need return for our investment.\n\n\u201cNNPC has done a lot to import the product but the main issue is the transportation. We have not been getting our payments. That\u2019s why we engaged a financial expert, Benham Group, to recoup our money for Nigerians to get regular supplies in the fuel stations.\u201d\n\nThe chief consultant and chairman of Benham Group, Dr. Maurice Ibe, said the collaboration was to ensure stabilisation of fuel supply at the filling stations.\n\nIbe said they were doing everything in their powers to stabilise activities in the downstream sector and ensure that products were transported to every nook and cranny of the country.\n\nHe said the fuel scarcity was affecting the country\u2019s economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cYou can\u2019t hold a businessman\u2019s money and expect the business to flourish. So, rescue our members so that they can function very well.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, IPMAN proposed dialogue between government and oil marketers in an effort to solve the recurrent fuel scarcity.\n\nNational Operations Controller, IPMAN, Mike Osatuyi, said the fuel scarcity would continue if the government failed to consider dialogue as a key solution.\n\nAccording to him, a meeting with the government, stakeholders, and security agents is needed to settle the crucial issues.\n\nOsatuyi, who spoke yesterday on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, lamented the reoccurring queues at petrol stations. He advised that meetings should be held bi-quarterly to review situation, even when products sold at the official price, instead of waiting till there was a problem.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOnce you don\u2019t give us the product and we buy from a third party, then there is no way things can go right. We need to go back to the drawing board, revise the template, and put all cards on the table.\n\n\u201cIf it involves increasing the pump price officially, why not, if the figures are right.\u201d\n\nOsatuyi further explained that in Nigeria, half a billion naira of subsidy every month was incurred, when gotten at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) rate of about N420 per litre.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey should call a meeting to discuss and solve the problem at once. I believe there\u2019s no problem that doesn\u2019t have a solution. There\u2019s no point going back and forth and we can\u2019t keep pretending things are okay because they are not.\n\n\u201cYou can have three million litres of fuel in your reserve but are you giving it to the right people at the right time and at the official price? The answer is no. So having these conversations everyday is not fair on Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOsatuyi, however, admitted that little was being done in terms of production, saying it does not go round. But he expressed optimism that at the commencement of production in the first quarter of next year, there would be enough fuel in the country.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Problem is Distribution, Not Supply, Says PENGASSAN\n\nNational President of PENGASSAN, Mr. Festus Osifo, said yesterday that there was enough stock of petrol in Nigeria, despite the scarcity in various parts of the country. Osifo spoke on a national television programme.\n\nHe maintained that Nigeria had a distribution problem, since the tanker drivers were not loading as much as they should because of unresolved issues around the \u201cbridging fund.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the PENGASSAN leader stated that private depots were selling their products above the N148 official ex-depot price because of some inbuilt logistics, making it impossible for retailers to sell at the official N165 per litre.\n\nOsifo stated, \u201cThe ex-depot price of this product is N148 as of today and there are some costs that are built into it. And one of the costs is the bridging fund, which NNPC would collect and remit to the NMDPRA.\n\n\u201cSo now at a particular time, they agreed with the truck drivers that bridging fund will be N10 per litre, depending on the destination you are going all over the country. At the time they agreed, the cost of diesel was about N250.\n\n\u201cBut today the cost of diesel is over N700, it has tripled. So the expectation from the tanker drivers is that since the cost of diesel has gone up, instead of paying N10 you have to multiply by three.\u201d\n\nOsifo stressed that the tanker drivers were not charity organisations, but were in business to make money, saying that even though Nigeria has close to two billion litres available in terms of petrol stock, it has been difficult getting the fuel to the filling stations.\n\n\u201cSo the problem is not the stock, we have the stock all over depots. The truck drivers, most of them are not willing to lift this product,\u201d he added.\n\nNNPC is the sole importer of petrol.\n\nOsifo stated that while it was possible for the national oil firm to sell at N148 at NNPC depots, private depots could not sell at the same price to retailers because of extra costs they bore to take the products to their depots.\n\nHe explained, \u201cSo they sell at a premium. And at the end of the day, they sell between N150 to N160. In some cases, they sell at N162 and if they sell at that amount, it will now be difficult for the retailer to go and sell about N165.\n\n\u201cThis is because you cannot buy products at up to N163, then pay some other transportation costs, plus your cost of operation and you are being asked to sell for N165.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, he explained, some retailers had declined to buy the products, leading to many petrol stations being closed for not having supply.\n\nOsifo added that Lagos had been free from supply issues before now because until recently, the retailers were okay with how much they were getting the product and selling to retailers.\n\nBut he said, \u201cThere\u2019s problem along the distribution line.\u201d\n\nTo resolve the problem, Osifo insisted that the federal government must define the short, medium and long-term approach to tackling it.\n\nIn the short term, he stated that there were already on-going discussions between the government and the tanker drivers, with a deal in sight to increase the bridging fund from about N10.4 to over N20.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo if they do that, although the tanker drivers are still pushing to add something to that, what is going to happen is that drivers will start loading and once they start loading, you are going to have petrol all over the country.\u201d\n\nOsifo also urged the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) to visit the private depot owners and discuss with them with a view to enforcing and implementing the approved price regime.\n\nIn the long term, Osifo maintained that Nigeria must begin to refine its products in-country, which had been the yearning of the trade unions. He said the cost of fuel was generally higher in countries that did not produce or refine their products.\n\nHe said if subsidy were removed today, Nigerians would be buying petrol for between N400 to N500, stressing that while the subsidy is meant to pay for the difference between the price it is imported and when it gets to the depots, it doesn\u2019t necessarily take care of bridging costs.\n\nOsifo stated, \u201cYou remember when the subsidy of N4 trillion was agreed and when the calculation was done, the landing cost was around N300 to N350. It wasn\u2019t what it is today. So now there is more pressure. If we go by the data we have today, I can tell you that we will not be spending N4 trillion; we may be spending upwards of about N4.5 to N5 trillion in subsidy.\n\n\u201cSo the major bulk of that subsidy goes to ameliorate or to cater for the difference between the amount of money that the PMS is bought in to the amount of money that NNPC supplies to the retailers.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Senators list conditions to halt action\n\n\u2022Two more lawmakers quit their parties\n\n\u202222 others planning to defect soon, Fani-Kayode raises the alarm\n\n\u2022PDP may soon form majority in upper chamber, Aduda boasts\n\n\u2022INEC has powers to reject Lawan, Akpabio, Falana declares\n\nSunday Aborisade and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\nNational Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, met with senators elected on the platform of the ruling party behind closed doors, yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the meeting with the APC caucus in the senate, Adamu said the party was worried by the gale of defections among senators. He however, said it was a usual occurrence in election periods and not peculiar to the ruling party.\n\nTwo senators from Bauchi and Imo states resigned their membership of APC and PDP, yesterday, further compounding the woes of their parties.\n\nThat was as other senators from the ruling party, who were said to have planned their defection for next week gave conditions under which they would halt the trend. They said only justice could reverse the gale of defections currently rocking the party.\n\nA chieftain of the APC and former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, hinted that no fewer than 22 more APC senators might dump the party for the main opposition PDP soon.\n\nSimilarly, the new Senate Minority Leader, Senator Philip Aduda, yesterday, boasted that the opposition PDP would soon form majority in the senate if the gale of defection by APC senators was sustained.\n\nIn a related development, Lagos-based lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, insisted that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was empowered by both constitutional and electoral provisions to reject the names of candidates from political parties that ought not to be on the ballot in any election.\n\nSpeaking after addressing the senators yesterday, Adamu said, \u201cThe meeting with the senators was most fruitful. The issue of defection is an unfortunate development, when it happens, but this is a season where there are all sorts of behaviours in the political space and ours is not an exception. In every election year, this kind of thing gives cause for stakeholders to sneeze and Nigeria is not an exception, so is the APC not an exception.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about what is happening in other parties, my focus is on the APC. But we all know that the occurrence is not only happening in the APC; it\u2019s happening across other political parties, too. And because we are the ruling party, our problems are exaggerated before the public.\u201d\n\nThe APC chairman said he did not know if the problem of defection was surmountable.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere is no responsible leader that would not be worried, when he loses one member, not to talk of two. At the moment, we are faced with the stark reality of our problems.\n\n\u201cI have committed my colleagues at the National Assembly to face the problem squarely and see the problem as solvable. We are in politics, I don\u2019t know what would happen tomorrow, and nobody does.\u201d\n\nSenators Lists Conditions to Halt Defection\n\nTHISDAY learnt from some senators, who attended the meeting that Adamu, that he cited intelligence reports available to the party leadership as reason for convening the parley.\n\nA senator from the North-west told THISDAY, on the condition of anonymity, that the APC national chairman said he learnt that some APC lawmakers were planning massive defections on the floor of the two chambers next week.\n\nBut he said his colleagues told Adamu that only justice could reverse the gale of defections rocking the party, noting that they sought the immediate intervention of the APC leadership to stem the tide.\n\nThe senator said, \u201cThe national chairman said the essence of his meeting with us was to find out the reasons APC senators were defecting. Adamu said he had intelligence reports that many senators were planning massive defections next week and he came to find out what could be done to halt the action.\n\n\u201cSome senators actually stood up to give different scenarios of the type of injustices they suffered in the hands of their governors. Adamu, after listening to them, promised that the National Working Committee of the APC and the leadership of the senate would meet soon to address the lawmakers\u2019 grievances.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than eight APC senators, including the Majority Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, had so far dumped the ruling party on the floor of the red chamber.\n\nTwo More Senators Quit Their Parties\n\nTwo senators from Bauchi and Imo states resigned their membership of both the APC and the PDP. Senator Dauda Jika, represents Bauchi Central and was elected on the platform of APC, while Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi, representing Imo East Senatorial District, was elected on the platform of the PDP.\n\nJika and Onyewuchi stated their decisions in separate letters addressed to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, where they gave reasons for resigning their membership of APC and PDP, to join the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Labour Party (LP), respectively.\n\nJika said, \u201cI hereby wish to notify you of my defection from the APC to the NNPP, whose ideals are in line with my political aspirations.\u201d\n\nOnyewuchi, on his part, said, \u201cI wish to inform Mr. President and the distinguished senators of my defection from the PDP to the Labour Party. This is after due consultation with my family, constituents and supporters. This will enable me participate fully in the movement for a new Nigeria.\u201d\n\nYesterday\u2019s defection brought the number of APC senators to 61, with members of the minority parties standing at 48.\n\nThe minority parties in the senate were five as at yesterday, Wednesday, June 22. They are the PDP, Young Peoples Party (YPP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), NNPP, and Labour Party.\n\nFani-Kayode: 22 More APC Senators Planning to Defect to PDP\n\nExcept there is a quick intervention, some 22 APC senators might leave the party soon for the PDP, a chieftain of the APC and former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, alerted.\n\nIn a post on his verified Twitter handle, yesterday, Fani-Kayode claimed the senators were threatening to defect to the PDP, because they had been denied the tickets to return to the Senate.\n\n\u201cThis is serious and something must be done to prevent it. Many are concerned and we urge our able Nat. Chairman and the National Secretary to reach them. We cannot afford to lose them,\u201d Fani-Kayode tweeted.\n\nWhen THISDAY contacted him on what informed his Tweet, Fani-Kayode said the lawmakers were very unhappy and had concluded plans to defect en mass soon.\n\nHe said this was why he raised the alarm so that those concerned in the party hierarchy might try to save the situation before it got out of hand.\n\nFani-Kayode claimed the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and National Secretary of the party, Iyiola Omisore, and himself had started to engaged with some of the senators.\n\nAduda: PDP May Soon Form Majority in Senate\n\nThe new Senate Minority Leader, Philip Aduda, boasted that PDP might soon form the majority in the Senate, with the number of senators defecting to his party.\n\nAduda stated this while addressing journalists in Abuja. He said as the new Minority Leader, there would surely be challenges, expressing hope, however, that those challenges would be surmounted.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere are a lot of challenges as 2023 approaches; we will manage them. This is the season you have aggrieved members from all sides, various defection by those who are aggrieved and those who got their parties\u2019 tickets. I can assure you that we will ensure we give meaningful leadership to the minority in the Senate.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the support that Mr Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), was getting from some PDP members, Aduda said he wasn\u2019t perturbed.\n\nAduda said, \u201cMake no mistake about it, grassroots politics is different from Internet politics. You can have a lot of followership on the Internet but when you go to the grassroots, it is not so.\n\n\u201cThe hype is not what is in the grassroots. It doesn\u2019t matter if Peter Obi is gathering followership, because in politics, we lose some and gain some.\u201d\n\nFalana: INEC Has Powers to Reject Lawan, Akpabio\n\nLagos-based lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, stated that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was empowered by both constitutional and electoral provisions to reject the names of candidates from political parties that ought not to be on the ballot in any election.\n\nFalana\u2019s remarks was in reaction to a statement attributed to a National Commissioner of INEC, Mr Mohammed Haruna, to the effect that the commission\u2019s responsibility did not include rejection of names submitted to it for an election by political parties.\n\nHaruna spoke against the backdrop of the submission of the names of Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, and former Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, as senatorial candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\nBoth Lawan and Akpabio contested the presidential primary of APC, while Akpabio later stepped down, Lawan lost to Senator Bola Tinubu, who won the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nYet, APC sent the names of Lawan and Akpabio as Yobe and Akwa Ibom states\u2019 senatorial candidates, respectively. Though, both men never bought the expression of interest and nomination forms of their party for the position of senator, and they were neither screened nor did they participate in the primary elections for such position.\n\nWhile the Akwa Ibom Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Mike Igini, had faulted the action of APC, Haruna, on the other hand, claimed that the electoral umpire had no power to reject names sent to it by political parties. In justifying his position, he maintained that primaries were the sole prerogatives of parties, adding that INEC\u2019s responsibility is merely to monitor the primaries and make sure they abide by their own regulations, the Electoral Act and the Constitution.\n\nBut Falana faulted Haruna based on the provisions of the Electoral Act, stressing, \u201cSection 84 (1) clearly states that a political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Act shall hold primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission. The monitoring by INEC is mandatory. To that extent, any primary of a political party not monitored by officials of INEC is illegal.\n\n\u201cContrary to the views credited to Mr. Haruna, the powers of INEC have gone beyond \u2018merely to monitor\u2019 party primaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Section: 84 (13) unequivocally provides that, \u2018where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said the legal implication of the provision is that INEC shall not include the candidate for the particular election.\n\nFalana stated further, \u201cFurthermore, Section 29 (1) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which provides for the submission of lists of candidates and their affidavits by political parties, states that, \u2018Every political party shall, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this Act, submit to the commission, in the prescribed forms, the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, Section 29(1) has imposed a duty on political parties to ensure that the candidates whose names are submitted to INEC have emerged from valid primaries.\n\nHe said this position was quite different from the provision in Section 31 of the repealed Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), which provided that INEC could not reject the name of any candidate submitted by the parties for any reason whatsoever.\n\nFalana said, \u201cThus, in the present law, the parties can only submit for the commission\u2019s acceptance, the names of candidates who emerged from valid primaries conducted by the parties and monitored by INEC.\n\n\u201cThis position is clearly fortified by Section 84(13). Thus, INEC having sent a team of monitors across its 36 states offices and the Federal Capital Territory, to monitor the primaries, is legally obligated to check the names submitted to it and ensure they are confirmed by the various reports compiled by its officials.\n\n\u201cIf the candidates, whose names are submitted to INEC have not emerged from the primaries, the commission will reject such names in exercise of its power under Section 84(13) of the Electoral Act 2022. That was what INEC did in Zamfara State, when that power was not even expressly provided for.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, most shocking to read in the social media statements attributed to some INEC National Commissioners to the effect that INEC is bound to accept the names of candidates, who did not participate in valid party primaries.\n\n\u201cWith respect, the statement that INEC does not have power to reject names of persons submitted by political parties that did not emerge from valid primaries is grossly misleading. In fact, the embarrassing statement amounts to abdication of statutory duty under the above quoted provision of the Electoral Act aimed at sanitising the process of nomination of candidates for national elections in Nigeria.\u201d",

It is this diversity that gives Nigeria its strength. That is why Nigeria\u2019s enemies seek to destroy it, by putting us against one another. We will not let them. The nation will not be distracted or divided by these obviously planned and politically motivated criminal outrages.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators are cowards; weak and wicked men with guns murdering, in cold blood, unarmed women and children at their places of worship.\u201d\n\nHaving noted the starkness of the contrast between the actions of those hateful cowards and those of true Nigerians in the aftermath of the Owo killing, the president observed that,\u201cseeing the crowd of Nigerians voluntarily rushing to donate blood after the attack, thronging the local hospitals, even in the midst of mourning, I was proud of my country. I was filled with hope.\n\n\u201cAs for the cowards, they will be punished for their crimes. We will bring them to justice. Rest assured that the full might of Nigeria\u2019s formidable security and intelligence forces are involved in that endeavour.\n\n\u201cFor now, I urge all Nigerians to come together in prayer \u2013 whether Christian, Muslim or any of our great faiths \u2013 let us hold the victims and their families in our hearts and minds.\n\n\u201cLet us show the cowards, who seek to divide us along religious lines that we will not be divided. Let us show them that Nigerians will continue to cherish what we share while respecting each other\u2019s differences. Let us show them that Nigerians will never be bullied by cowards, extremists or terrorists,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "Sunday Aborisade\n\n\n\nThe Senate yesterday constituted an Ad-Hoc Committee to investigate Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) over non-compliance with the Petroleum Industry Act and breach of the Joint Venture Agreement entered into with the federal government.\n\nThe Ad-Hoc committee was mandated to probe the oil mining lease granted to SPDC between 1959 to 1989, and 1989 to 2019 under the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture agreement.\n\nThe Ad-Hoc Committee which was constituted by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi as its Chairman.\n\nOther members on the panel include Senators George Thompson Sekibo, Abdullahi Yahaya, Bassey Albert Akpan, Olamilekan Solomon Adeola, Smart Adeyemi and Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed.\n\nAccordingly, the chamber demanded a refund of $200 million (USD) or any amount short of what was paid by SPDC, including penalties and interests under the said lease agreements to the coffers of the federal government.\n\nThe resolution was reached by the chamber after it considered a motion sponsored by Senator George Thompson Sekibo (PDP, Rivers East).\n\nThe motion was entitled, \u201cNon-payment of the sum of $200,000,000 accruals from the Oil Mining Lease (OML), by Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited under the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture Agreement and, illegal and unlawful renewal of Oil Mining Leases by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) contrary to the provision of paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to the Petroleum Act 1969 (now Section 86(1) and 86(6) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2022.\u201d\n\nSekibo, in a presentation observed that the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture (JV) agreement, in alleged contravention of the provisions of the Petroleum Act 1969, by the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, granted to the SPDC/NNPC a 30-year OML from 1959 to 1989.\n\nHe observed that doing so constituted an illegal extension of the OML by 10 years in the first instance, instead of the prescribed term of 20 years, without recourse to the provisions of the Petroleum Act 1969 in paragraph 10 of the First Schedule.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, \u201cupon the expiration of the initial OML in 1989, SPDC/NNPC JV, was granted another 30-year OML again from 1st July 1989 to 30th June, 2019, by the Ministry of Petroleum Resource/DPR instead of the 20 years lease period prescribed by the Petroleum Act, which is contrary to paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to the said Act.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in the initial additional 10 years OML of 1969 to 1989, allegedly granted illegally to the SPDC/NNPC JV by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/DPR, the federal government lost from fees, taxes, rents and royalties the sum of $120, 000, 000.\n\nHe stated that in the second instance of the extra 10 years the federal government also lost a further sum of $80,000,000, making total of $200,000,000.\n\nHe noted that a loss of $200,000,000, which was equivalent to N83, 130, 000, 000 billion, could have been of great value to the economy of the nation.\n\nHe observed that the illegal action by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/DPR as regards the SPDC/NNPC JV may not be the only non-compliant grant as details of other Joint Venture agreements with: Chevron Nigeria Limited, ENI Joint Venture, EXXON Mobil Upstream JV, Total E & P Nigeria Limited JV, need to be ascertained through a thorough investigation to verify compliance with the provisions of the extant law.\n\nHe expressed worry that the trend of illegal extension of Joint Venture (JV) period from 20 years to 30 years lease period without recourse to the Petroleum Act may have also applied to other Joint Venture agreements with the International Oil Companies (IOCs) and need to be investigated.\n\nSekibo informed the chamber that SPDC went to Court on the clarity of the lease period and the judgment was not in their favour as regards the additional 10 years lease period in the two instances.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the court failed to order the SPDC to pay the arrears the 20 years lease period to the tune of $200,000,000 to the federal government for the illegal extensions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker further disclosed that a whistle-blower had petitioned the EFCC on the need to recover the sum of $200,000,000 from SPDC for the illegal extensions by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources/DPR and to further investigate all other Joint Venture agreements that involved the aforementioned IOCs.\n\nHe noted that the power to make laws for the Federation as vested in the National Assembly by the Constitution also encompasses the power to make laws for the promotion of national prosperity and a dynamic self-reliant economy as provided in section 16(1)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.\n\nHe emphasised that the Constitution also gives power to each House of the National Assembly to carry out appropriate investigation on observed misapplication of the laws enacted by the National Assembly, as provided in Section 88 of the Constitution.\n\nHe stated further that Section 89 of the same Constitution provides the process on how such investigation should be carried out.\n\nAccordingly, the Senate resolved to constitute an Ad-Hoc Committee to investigate the non-compliance with the Petroleum Act and the Oil Mining Lease granted to SPDC between 1959 to 1989, and 1989 to 2019 under the SPDC/NNPC Joint Venture Agreement; and compel SPDC to refund to the Federal Government the sum of $200,000,000 or any amount short of what was paid, including penalties and interests under the said lease agreement.",

The price is fixed and the ex-depot price is known. The pump price remains at N165. So we continue to urge Nigerians to keep within these operating rules,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, in the next three days, the Authority would focus its energy in making sure that the marine stock would be translated into inland stock to get petroleum products across the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cWithin a very short while, we will see the fuel queues pale out. So that is what our focus in the Authority and for the next few days we urge every operator and indeed even assure the public that whatever glitches and supply gaps that have been observed will disappear shortly.\n\n\u201cSo we do not encourage any panic buying. We urge Nigerians to be calm as these things will be resolved very easily.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Executive Director, NNPC, Adeyemi Adetunji, said over two billion litres of PMS that would last for the next 34 days was in country, adding that there was enough stock to meet the nation\u2019s demand. He assured that NNPC was working with the entire operators and stakeholders in the downstream sector to ensure that petroleum products get to distribution channels and filling stations across the country.\n\n\u201cWith all the apparatuses put in place, we can assure that all the fuel queues will disappear in the next few days. Nigerians will continue to enjoy the free flow of petroleum products,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director, Petroleum Pipeline Marketing Company (PPMC), Isiaku Abdullahi, said all hands were on the deck to support its marketers and transporters to ensure that petroleum products get to where they are needed.\n\nHe said there were about three vessels in the Apapa jetty waiting to offload more than 60 million metric tonnes, adding that in due course, the potential and imagined fuel crisis in Lagos would be over.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director, NIPCO Plc, Suresh Kumar, said his company was receiving 18 million litres of the 90,000 metric tonnes waiting to be offloaded at the Apapa jetty.\n\n\u201cI am happy to announce that we have another 32 million to be received from the vessels which are coming. So, with that in picture, you know, the supply gap or the supply logistic challenges which was there has been addressed.\n\n\u201cSo, the products are there with us, we can see that the trucks have started coming up. The Authority has given us the first approval to see that these products of about 30 to 40 million litres should be dispensed on a 24-hour basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, what I can categorically assure all Nigerians is that the product is there and it is going to flow into the trucks and they are going to move from here to the stations. So, they have to be rest assured they should not panic, panic is a problem, it will create high demand.\n\n\u201cSo without panic and if this normal situation functions, then everybody should be getting product in the next couple of days,\u201d he averred.\n\nDepot Owners Lament Unsustainable N165 Per Litre Petrol Pump Price\n\nHowever, DAPPMAN, in a statement issued last night, said the on-going Russian/Ukraine War had adversely affected the whole world, including the downstream oil and gas sector in Nigeria, impacting negatively on global and local fuel and food supply.\n\nIt said the international prices of these items had risen astronomically and had more than doubled their old rates since the beginning of the war, thereby causing extreme increases in local prices.\n\nBy extension, DAPPMAN said the local running costs of operating their various fuel depots had gone up astronomically, adding that the petrol they supply was sourced, solely from Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited\u2019s marketing subsidiary, Petroleum Products Marketing Company Limited (PPMC) for sale to the public at the regulated price of N165 per litre. It explained that this purchase was made by depot operators with funds sourced with high bank interest charges, alongside increased costs of hiring vessels, with which they deliver the fuel cargoes to their depots.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThese costs have doubled within the period of this Russian/Ukraine war.\n\nAdded to this is the scarcity of bunkers (ship\u2019s fuel). We also experienced astronomical increases in the cost of diesel used to power equipment and machinery in our various depots and our retail outlets.\n\n\u201cDepot Owners and the government have continued to struggle over time to sustain supply of PMS at the current pump price of N165 per litre despite the huge subsidy cost to government and abysmal margins to the Depot owners.\u201d\n\nThe marketers\u2019 association observed that if not for its suspension, the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 would have provided an ideal enabling environment by creating the free market in which demand and supply would affect fuel pump price.\n\n\u201cWe hereby assure the public that Depot Owners, working in concert with NNPC Limited, through its marketing subsidiary, will continue to work hard to ensure availability of products nationwide,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHouse Summons NNPC, NMDPRA, Marketers over Fuel Scarcity, Soaring Diesel, Gas Prices\n\nThe House of Representatives has summoned stakeholders in the Nigerian downstream oil and gas sector to appear before it today over the resurgence of petrol scarcity and queues in some parts of the country and the galloping rise in the prices of diesel and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n\nThe lawmakers in a letter signed by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Joint Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) Hon. Mahmud Gaya, invited the heads of the stakeholder organisations and institutions in the Nigerian downstream petroleum sector.\n\nThose invited, in the letter seen by THISDAY, yesterday, included the Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) and that of the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC), two subsidiaries of NNPC Limited.\n\nOthers were the Chairman of the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAM), President of IPMAN and Chairman of DAPPMAN.\n\n\u201cYour various Memoranda should be forwarded to the Committee\u2019s secretariat in 60 print copies and a soft copy at the House of Representatives Complex on or before Wednesday 22 June, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs we look forward to receiving you, please accept the warmest assurances of the Joint Committee\u2019s highest esteem.\u201d, the concluding page of the letter read.\n\nFor the past few months, Nigerians have been going through difficulties to get petrol, diesel and cooking gas due to the scarcity and astronomical increase in the prices of the products, which are all imported.\n\nThe hike in the prices of the petroleum products, just like other commodities, has been blamed on the ongoing oil price rally, exacerbated by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the resultant trade sanctions against Russia, a major global supplier of refined petroleum products.\n\nA litre of diesel in Nigerian is currently selling for above N800 while a 12.5 kilogram of cooking gas is being sold for over N10,000 in some locations. This has pushed many users of the two products into using alternative sources like petrol generators, solar, inverters, firewood and charcoal.\n\nHowever, petrol that is still selling cheaper despite the global hike in prices, owing to the huge subsidy the country is spending to keep the pump price at N165 per litre, far less than the actual landing cost, is now becoming scarce and unavailable in some states including Lagos, Oyo, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nThe Chairman of IPMAN, Lagos Satellite Depot, Mr. Akin Akinrinade, had lamented the shortage of petrol in their depot, stated that since December 2021, not a litre of petrol had been lifted at the NNPC satellite depots at Ejigbo.\n\nThis, he noted, had left independent marketers at the mercy of private depots, whom he accused of hiking their ex- depot prices to a level no longer sustainable to sell petrol at N165.\n\nThe IPMAN chairman said based on current economic realities, the sustainable pump price for petrol in in the country should be at N180 per litre.",
          "summary": "The statement by the NMDPRA that insisted on N165 per litre for pump price, came on the heels of the recent agitation by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) that PMS sold at N165 was no longer sustainable.\nThe pump price remains at N165.\nHe assured that NNPC was working with the entire operators and stakeholders in the downstream sector to ensure that petroleum products get to distribution channels and filling stations across the country.\nNigerians will continue to enjoy the free flow of petroleum products,\u201d he added.\nThe IPMAN chairman said based on current economic realities, the sustainable pump price for petrol in in the country should be at N180 per litre.",

          "title": "INSIGHT: How security situation in south-east degenerated in one year",
          "text": "For many years, south-east Nigeria was considered the safest geopolitical zone in the country. The five states \u2014 Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo \u2014 that form the zone had recorded the least spate of violent attacks in comparison with other parts of the country.\n\nFor instance, in its 2019 report, Nigeria Mourns said the south-east recorded the least number of reported killings with 94 deaths, while the south-west recorded 157 deaths, followed by south-south with 341 deaths. North-central recorded 469 deaths and the north-east had 1009 while north-west had the highest with 1,118 deaths.\n\nHowever, with renewed secessionist agitations by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which have turned radical and violent, as well as the government\u2019s countermeasures, security in the region has deteriorated.\n\nAmid growing concerns about the violence and kidnappings associated with bandits and rogue herders, IPOB\u2019s leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who is now facing criminal charges, said the group needed to protect the south-east and launched a security outfit named the Eastern Security Network (ESN) on December 13, 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Powerful, IPOB\u2019s spokesman, had said the objective of the network is to protect the south-east from \u201ccriminal activity\u201d, adding that ESN is a replica of Amotekun, a security outfit established by the governors of the south-west to curb insecurity in that geopolitical zone. But ESN has been blamed for escalating attacks on civilians and government facilities and security personnel in the south-east.\n\nDespite the launch of ESN purportedly to ensure security, recent data from Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and media reports show that killings in the south-east rose by 555.7 percent between 2020 and 2021.\n\nMedia reports of violent attacks collated by CFR and other media platforms were analysed to ascertain the number of killings in the south-east. The analysis was from January 1, 2020, to December 12, 2021. Reported killings associated with domestic violence and mob justice were excluded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the data obtained, the south-east recorded 97 deaths in reported violent attacks between January 1, 2020 and December 12, 2020, while 636 deaths were recorded in reported violent attacks between December 13, 2020, and December 12, 2021.\n\nIMO STATE \u2014 EPICENTRE OF KILLINGS IN SOUTH-EAST\n\nImo state recorded the highest number of fatalities with 208 deaths, representing 32.7 percent of the total figure within one year. Imo was followed by Anambra with 187 deaths, Ebonyi recorded 103 deaths, followed by Abia with 70 deaths, and Enugu recorded 68 deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImo has been the scene of some of the most audacious attacks targeting state security facilities and personnel in the region. On April 5, 2021, gunmen attacked the Imo police headquarters and correctional service. According to authorities, the gunmen freed at least 1,844 inmates during the attack and also looted the police armoury.\n\nReacting to the incident, Mohammed Adamu, the then inspector-general of police, had accused IPOB\u2019s armed unit \u2013 ESN \u2013 of being culpable. Some hours after the attack, Kanu, IPOB\u2019s leader, posted a tweet saying nobody deserves to be in a prison in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf Miyetti Allah terror herdsmen & other murderous #Fulani groups, including Boko Haram insurgents, can be arrested, freed and rehabilitated by this neo-colonial Fulanised @NGRPresident, then no single soul deserves to be in any prison in Nigeria. If you know you know! #UGM,\u201d Kanu tweeted, appearing to declare his approval for the coordinated attacks.\n\nHowever, IPOB denied involvement in the incident, saying it is not in the group\u2019s mandate to attack security personnel and prisons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnknown gunmen are different people which we don\u2019t know and they are not IPOB or ESN security outfit,\u201d IPOB spokesperson had said. Gunmen unleashing deadly attacks in the region are described as \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d in the media and public discourses. But many believe the so-called unknown gunmen are ESN/IPOB operatives, drawn from dissatisfied youth in the zone where unemployment and feelings of marginalisation are widespread.\n\n46 STATIONS ATTACKED, 103 OFFICERS KILLED IN ONE YEAR\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spate of violent attacks on police officers and their facilities also skyrocketed in the period under review. In 2020, not less than 11 police officers were reported to have been killed in the south-east. Majority of the attacks occurred during the violence that trailed the October 20, 2020 #EndSARS protest.\n\nSubsequently, 46 police stations and eight police checkpoints were reported to have been attacked in the geopolitical zone in 2021. Within that period, 103 police officers were reported to have been murdered in a series of violent attacks. Offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other government assets were also attacked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018USE OF FORCE COMPLICATED THE SITUATION\u2019\n\nFreedom Onuorah, a security expert, blames the \u201cdramatic deterioration of security in the south-east\u201d on the activities of IPOB/ESN.\n\nHe said ESN was set up to combat activities of \u201cherdsmen\u201d allegedly responsible for the attacks on rural communities \u2014 but the use of force against the outfit by security operatives and designation of IPOB as a terrorist group complicated the situation.\n\nHe said the attack on the Imo prison triggered the regrouping of former criminals.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) of the IPOB is implicated in the raiding of some forest to confront some Fulani herdsmen allegedly responsible for the attacks on rural communities in the south-east,\u201d Onuorah said. \u201cHowever, the manner in which federal security forces went after the ESN complicated the situation as it became difficult to identify the ESN group and their command structure.\u201d\n\nThe security expert submitted that the continuation of the sit-at-home in the south-east despite its suspension by IPOB shows the group has \u201clost control\u201d of its men in the zone.\n\nHe suggested that the federal government should dialogue with IPOB and seek a \u201cnegotiated settlement\u201d for Kanu who is currently in the custody of the Department of State Security (DSS).\n\nHe further encouraged south-east governors to set up a \u201crobust regional\u201d security outfit that will prioritise the activation of community-driven early warning system, and enhanced identification of residents or visitors.\n\n\u2018INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN STRATEGY\u2019\n\nIkenga Tochukwu, the Anambra police spokesperson, agreed that the south-east, including Anambra, is experiencing rising insecurity.\n\nWhen presented with the data findings, Tochukwu said the security situation should not be \u201csensationalised\u201d, adding that the Anambra police command is addressing the insecurity with \u201ccommunity-driven intelligence\u201d.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let us be sensational about this. Yes, we have a security situation in the south-east, including Anambra state. We are addressing it and I can tell you that right now our strategies are intelligence-driven,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018FG CAUSED INSECURITY IN SOUTH-EAST\u2019\n\nPowerful, IPOB spokesperson, believes the federal government \u201csponsored\u201d criminal elements committing atrocities in the zone \u2014 a claim he was unable to back with evidence.\n\nHe argued that the mandate of ESN is to secure farmlands and forests, adding that the government was intimidated by the formation of the security outfit.\n\n\u201cWe observed the same skyrocketing of crime within the south-east no doubt and the answer is not far-fetched,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria government was perplexed and scared upon the unveiling of a few batches of ESN volunteers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and they immediately sponsored criminals, cultists to commit all manner of atrocities in the south-east.\n\n\u201cThe ESN that you hear of are not criminals, these are educated youths, most of whom are professionals in various fields, experts and authorities in their chosen professions, some are abroad, and some of them also resigned from this current government regime.\u201d\n\nThis report was produced under the 2022 Dataphyte fellowship.\n\nAdditional reporting from Ayodele Oluwafemi.",

We are addressing it and I can tell you that right now our strategies are intelligence-driven,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018FG CAUSED INSECURITY IN SOUTH-EAST\u2019\n\nPowerful, IPOB spokesperson, believes the federal government \u201csponsored\u201d criminal elements committing atrocities in the zone \u2014 a claim he was unable to back with evidence.\n\nHe argued that the mandate of ESN is to secure farmlands and forests, adding that the government was intimidated by the formation of the security outfit.\n\n\u201cWe observed the same skyrocketing of crime within the south-east no doubt and the answer is not far-fetched,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria government was perplexed and scared upon the unveiling of a few batches of ESN volunteers by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and they immediately sponsored criminals, cultists to commit all manner of atrocities in the south-east.\n\n\u201cThe ESN that you hear of are not criminals, these are educated youths, most of whom are professionals in various fields, experts and authorities in their chosen professions, some are abroad, and some of them also resigned from this current government regime.\u201d\n\nThis report was produced under the 2022 Dataphyte fellowship.\n\nAdditional reporting from Ayodele Oluwafemi.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

Kindly register your interests here.\n\nDevelopment agencies\u2014international and local non-governmental organisations\u2014are tasked with fostering the socio-economic development of different countries, but now more than ever they are realising that leveraging technology is a no-brainer.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC), the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the development of the private sector, might be more popular for financing roads, ports and other infrastructure across Africa but over the past 60 years has been it has invested about $10 billion in the private sector, working with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to create jobs and improve livelihoods. In 2020, it led the World Bank Group #GlobalTechChallenge initiative to match early-stage health tech innovators with healthcare providers in East Africa. Some of these health tech companies were also provided with funding.\n\nSource: Fikayo Idowu, TechCabal Insights.\n\nTo reduce the financing gap women entrepreneurs still face, in January the IFC launched the ScaleX program that incentivises accelerators to help women-led companies in emerging markets raise equity financing by awarding deserving accelerators up to $25,000. Three years after leading a $8.6 million Series A Investment in Africa\u2019s Talking, the IFC recently backed ride-hailing startup Gozem with $10 million to finance 6,000 vehicles in Togo and Benin.\n\nClosely related to this is the work the International Trade Centre does toward making global prosperity a reality by connecting small businesses in developing countries to international markets. This entails that it has projects in Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mali, Uganda, Zambia, and other African countries that focus on the creation of sustainable jobs in the digital technologies sector, and the modernisation of agribusiness through digital technologies.\n\nAdvisory services can play an important role in shaping the allocation of vast amounts of resources. In this vein, the AU-EU D4D Hub primarily aids African governments with strategy formulation and frameworks for digital transformation.\n\nIn the 2 years since it launched, the AU-EU D4D Hub has conducted feasibility studies in Uganda and Rwanda, as well as learning sessions with the Tanzanian government. Germany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) make-IT project develops and implements accelerator and funding programmes across 18 countries on the continent, according to a 2017-2019 impact report\n\nSource: Fikayo Idowu, TechCabal Insights.\n\nWith an estimated number of over 300 million French speakers across 5 continents, the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), which was created in 1970, is increasing its efforts to give francophone African startups more visibility and attract funding.\n\nSenegal\u2019s D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) since 2018 has been investing in the country\u2019s tech environment, granting about 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out and helping transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem.\n\nMany other African country governments like Mauritius, Congo, Tunisia, Ghana, and Rwanda have initiatives to spur the tech ecosystem in their country.\n\nIt can be challenging to quantify the impact of some of these projects and programmes\u2014training sessions or sponsorship of startups to conferences, for example\u2014but they sure lead to business leads and investment opportunities.\n\nThe attention that African startups are receiving from developmental and international agencies is a testament to the capability of these startups to spread innovation and produce tailor-made solutions for some of Africa\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nPartner Message\n\nApplications are now open for the Decentralized Umoja Algorand Bounty Hack III, by Algorand and Reach. The Africa-focused hackathon is an excellent opportunity for developers to learn & build blockchain projects\u2014prizes of up to $6,000 to be won, including a $1,000 participation prize. Applications are open here until 15th July 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBetter awareness of the different players and activities in the African tech ecosystem creates room for collaboration. For instance, during the European Development Days, I witnessed an intro conversation between representatives of the ITC and African European Digital Innovation Bridge (AEDIB) Initiative concerning their projects. The ITC is working on mapping the tech hubs in Africa, while the AEDIB is building digital innovation hubs\u2014a virtual cluster of innovation centres such as tech hubs, research institutes, universities and others in a community. Since they were working on solving a similar problem, at different levels, it created a perfect opportunity for a partnership.\n\nOne way to scale the impact of the investment activities of development agencies in the Africa tech ecosystem is to increase similar partnerships between them and other players such as tech hubs, universities, and research institutes.\n\nFrom the Cabal\n\nHave a great week.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Next Wave.

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Nigeria lost at least $1.8 billion yearly between 2010 and 2019 as a result of the federal government\u2019s protectionist measures, the World Bank has said.\n\nAccording to the Washington-based global financial institution, these protectionist policies have been central to the country\u2019s limited success in diversifying the economy and furthering the growth of the manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cNigeria lost $1.8 billion every year between 2010 and 2019 due to tariff evasion arising from protectionist measures,\u201d it said in the June edition of its Nigeria Development Update.\n\nThe World Bank noted that these policies, which restrict imports, have led to a loss in revenue, an increase in consumer prices, an increase in the cost of production, constraining domestic firms\u2019 competitiveness, and limiting their potential to export to regional and global markets.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s trade policy has moved in a heavily protectionist direction, with an escalation of import restrictions through higher tariffs and levies, import bans, foreign exchange limitations, and border closures,\u201d it said.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced restrictions on access to foreign exchange for the importation of certain products that could be produced locally, with the aim of bolstering foreign exchange reserves and supporting domestic industries.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, please note that these items are not banned, thus importers desirous of importing them shall do so using their own funds without any recourse to the Nigerian foreign exchange markets,\u201d the CBN said.\n\nThe items include rice, cement, margarine, fertiliser, milk and dairy products, maize/corn, palm kernel/palm oil products/vegetable oils, meat and processed meat products, vegetables/processed vegetable products, and poultry chicken.\n\nThe apex bank began the policy with 41 items in 2015, but the number has since reached 45.\n\nThe federal government closed the country\u2019s land borders in August 2019 in a bid to curb smuggling.\n\nThe border closure was accompanied by a significant rise in inflation, especially for food products that are affected by foreign exchange restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe closure only had a temporary effect in impeding the transit of illegal trade through Benin into Nigeria,\u201d World Bank said.\n\nThe World Bank noted that the price increases recorded between mid-2019 and 2020, following the border closure, meant that households needed to spend around 1.8 percent more to maintain the same level of welfare.\n\nThe World Bank said increased openness to trade could help Nigeria achieve longstanding policy goals of economic diversification and industrial development.\n\nRead also: CBN keeps printing cash to finance deficit, says EIU\n\nFranklyn Akinsoloye, president of Association of Business Development Professionals, told BusinessDay that the government needed to embark on bold and holistic reforms to revive the economy.\n\n\u201cWe need to embark on economic reforms that will restore our economy back to life. We must refine locally, ensure full deregulation to reap gains of global oil rise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe economic managers should look at how to improve exports. Once they increase exports, there will be more dollars and naira will strengthen.\u201d\n\nKen Ifedi, a consultant to the CBN and economics professor, said beyond the concerns of the World Bank, Nigeria must identify an area of competitive advantage and build on it.\n\n\u201cWe need to re-engineer our economy into productivity, riding on the digital economy. We need to do another rebasing of the economy to have a holistic view of where we can have strategic and appropriate interventions,\u201d Ifedi said.",

          "text": "Buhari gets the rebuke for saying Nigerians are better off today than in 2015\n\nIs Nigeria better off today than in 2015\n\nThere are two things politicians do not have control over \u2013 time and history. One day, whether they like it or not, their time in power will end. Secondly, the duty of writing their history belongs to others and not the politicians.\n\nWhen a politician seeks to write his own history, he only indulges in self-adulation. That may be exactly what President Muhammadu Buhari sought to do last week when in a written response to questions from Bloomberg, he posited that Nigerians are in a better place today than in 2015.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the rebuke against the president\u2019s comments was swift in coming. In the Bloomberg interview, Buhari had been asked how he will rate his performance in fulfilling his pledges to fight corruption, secure the country and fix the economy. \u201cWe leave Nigeria in a far better place than we found it,\u201d the president said.\n\nFinding Nigerians who say they are better off today is like looking for a needle in the bed of an ocean. The day after Buhari\u2019s assertion, leaders of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry and economists countered the claim made by the President.\n\nChairman of the Gas Group, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Mr Ola Adebayo, said Buhari\u2019s regime\u2019s policies have not translated into positive economy growth and real sector development, insisting \u201cwe only have very good policies on paper.\u201d\n\nDeputy-President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Gabriel Idahosa, said the reality was at variance with the claims, explaining, \u201cthe business community has been consistent in saying so. It\u2019s not a matter of disagreeing with him. It\u2019s a matter of looking at the facts.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, Nigeria\u2019s insecurity situation has worsened, spreading from the traditional theatre in the northwest down to the hitherto quiet part of the south where killings and kidnappings have become rampant.\n\nOn Sunday June 5, 68 worshippers at a Catholic church in the sleepy town of Owo, were mowed down in a hail of bullets by Islamic militants. Between January 2020 and June of 2022, a total of 2,079 Nigerians died in mass killings around the country according to a report by Punch newspaper.\n\nOn the economic front, the situation is even more dire. Since Buhari took power in 2015, Nigeria has suffered two debilitating economic contractions that. Continue to ripple through with disastrous consequences for the people. Poverty is rife compounded by an ever-rising inflation and Nigeria is approaching a fiscal cliff with a severe debt servicing that consumes virtually all government revenues.\n\nWith no end in sight to the double whammy of soaring petrol subsidy and plunging crude oil production, the World Bank warned a week ago that a fiscal time bomb could explode in Nigeria. \u201cDespite rising oil and gas revenues for the Federation, deductions for the petrol subsidy are causing stagnation in net oil and gas revenues transferred to the Federation Account. Many states are expected to see a drop in federation revenue transfers in 2022 despite growing expenditure needs,\u201d the bank said.\n\nPoverty is surging and the number of out of school children in Nigeria is now the highest in the world, with the country accounting for one in every five of the world\u2019s out of school children according to UNICEF data.\n\nIn the two years from 2018, the country dropped three places from 158 to 161 in the Global Human Development Index, HDI published by the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP and is a measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living.\n\nNigeria is in the throes of an inflation crisis which the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU recently said is being worsened by the country\u2019s central bank. According to the EIU, \u201cthe CBN has continued to print money for the federal government, whose overdraft facility with the CBN reached N19trn (US$46bn) in April 2022, up from N17.4trn at end-2021.\n\nThe CBN is also operating a range of direct lending schemes for the agricultural, manufacturing and energy sectors, currently totalling about N3.6trn (US$9bn).\u201d All these make nonsense of the apex bank\u2019s monetary tightening initiatives.\n\nIn the meantime, prices of commodities continue to gallop with annualized inflation in Nigeria surging from 9% in 2015 to today\u2019s 17.17%. Everyone is hurting and chunk of the country\u2019s middle class is being wiped out.\n\nA new report by SB Morgen, titled \u2018Nigeria\u2019s History of Inflation: A Tale of the Destruction of Value\u2019, identified the 2019 border closure by Buhari, high import tariffs, petrol subsidy, and the current exchange rate regime of the Central Bank of Nigeria as major factors stifling supply, thus fuelling a surge in prices of various commodities which leave the people poorer.\n\n\u201cAll of these these unorthodox policies have ensured that inflation remains firmly in the double-digit realm under the Buhari administration, while purchasing power has more than halved, wiping out large sections of the middle class,\u201d the report said.\n\nRead also: Numbers disprove Buhari\u2019s claim on better Nigeria\n\n\u201cThese policies have also seen to it that most of the institutional safeguards put in place after the return to democracy to foster responsible fiscal and monetary policy as well as put inflation in check have been disregarded and rendered redundant,\u201d the report added.\n\nThe country\u2019s fiscal deficit which stood at N800bn in the whole of 2015 climbed to N7.3trn in 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s electricity grid fails more often than it delivers power and cannot in truth be regarded as a grid anymore. Homes go without power for days in Nigeria including in the capital of Abuja and the rapid jump in diesel from N145/litre in 2015 to today\u2019s N800/litre ensures that even some of the middle class who have power generators can no longer keep their generators running.\n\nMany Nigerians laugh at claims that corruption has been dealt a blow by Buhari. Firstly, the annual corruption index ranking by Transparency International has seen Nigeria drop from the 136th position in 2015 to 154 in 2021, a drop of 18 under Buhari\u2019s watch.\n\nThe nation was greeted to an unsavory melodrama weeks ago when the country\u2019s accountant general was hauled into prison while being investigated for stealing a whooping N80bn.\n\nExperts say Buhari\u2019s failure has been exacerbated by the collapse of the economy. In 2014, Nigeria attracted $4.7bn in foreign direct investment. Last year, this figure slumped to a mere $669m on account of Buhari\u2019s policy options that have helped to create an unfriendly investment climate in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, Bloomberg which first published the president\u2019s comments said \u201cthe out-going president may be satisfied with his performance but it is unlikely that most Nigerians, millions of whom have slipped into poverty in recent years, are.\u201d According to Bloomberg, \u201cBuhari\u2019s policies such as import curbs have spurred inflation as they limit supplies of some goods, yet manufacturing is still inadequate.\n\nThe country produces way less power than it needs and imports gasoline despite being Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer. Debt repayments eat up almost all of government revenue and the naira has plummeted to repeated lows during Buhari\u2019s time in office.\n\nNigeria is home to more extremely poor people than any other country, according to a United Nations measure, and the unemployment rate has surged to among the world\u2019s highest.\u201d",

He said the street is always flooded every raining season leaving some residents with no choice than to seek shelter with their relatives elsewhere until the rainy season is over.\n\nAccording to Okonedo, \u201cWe have written several letter to the state government through the Commissioner for Works and all to no avail. All they keep telling us for the past seven years is that they will soon start work on the road.\n\nMadam Eseoghene , resident of Sokoh Estate Road,in Uwvie Local Government Area of the state lamented the deplorable condition of the road,saying\n\n\u201d This road has been like this for more than 4years. Two days ago ,it was God that saved my daughter,she was returning from work , around 9pm, you see that bad portion near the filling station, you must slow down before passing there, robbers were operating and she didn\u2019t know until she got do close .She quickly jumped out of her car and ran away.\n\n\u201cThis road is not only spoiling our cars, worst still, putting our lives at risk\u201d. She lamented.\n\nMr Francis Onos ,an Uber driver,while complaining bitterly about the road said, \u201d one would have expected the government to maintain road because ,this is a major road linking Jakpa road to Airport Road, if not for this community boys that help to patch the big potholes with broken blocks,the road would have long been abandoned\u201d. Okowa should do something!\u201d He enthused.\n\nAnother residents said, ,\u201dFor those of us who live and have stores here, we cannot do any business during this rainy season because the whole street is flooded. I am a tailor and I have my store here but because of the bad road customers no longer come because the whole place is flooded,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Kiesena Omoyibo who lives at 22 Ginuwa Road in Warri said that they have been experiencing flood in the street for over eight years, adding that on several occasions the flood entered their houses whenever it rains.\n\nHe said, \u201cthis road has been like this for so many years and government have refused to come and fix it for us. We have to fold our trousers and pull our shoes in our hands anytime we are going out and coming in.\n\n\u201cOkowa should please come to our aide because we are suffering. People call Okowa the Road Master but we are not feeling the impact of that name in this street. He should come and fix this road for us before he leaves office so that we can say he has done something for us,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral roads in the oil-rich city including the Effurun Roundabout, Sokoh Estate, First Marine Gate, Etuwewe, Uti among many others are in very bad shape and residents are calling on the state government under the leadership of Senator Ifeanyi Okowa to come to their aid.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

          "text": "Fitch Ratings has upgraded Fidelity Bank Plc\u2019s long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to \u2018B\u2019 from \u2018B-\u2019\n\nThe latest upgrade in Fidelity Bank\u2019s rating which was issued at the weekend reflects bank\u2019s improving business profile and resilient financial metrics, Fitch stated. The rating agency also upgraded Fidelity\u2019s National Long-Term Rating to \u2018A(nga)\u2019 from \u2018BBB+(nga)\u2019.\n\nAccording to the rating note, the upgrade reflected the bank\u2019s increased creditworthiness relative to other issuers in Nigeria. \u201cFidelity\u2019s Long- and Short-Term IDRs are driven by its standalone creditworthiness, as expressed by its Viability Rating (VR) of \u2018b\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe VR reflects healthy asset quality, good business profile and reasonable capitalisation and liquidity. These are balanced against high sensitivity to Nigeria\u2019s challenging operating environment as well as higher credit concentration as a percentage of equity and weaker profitability than larger domestic-rated peers,\u201d it said.\n\nOn the downside to operating conditions, the rating agency said: \u201crising global risks will weaken domestic operating conditions. Inflation is expected to remain stubbornly high, posing downside risks to our real GDP growth forecasts of 3.4 per cent in 2022 and 3.1 per cent in 2023. However, downside risks are somewhat mitigated by strong oil prices, which should also underpin growth in non-oil sectors and asset quality.\u201d\n\nFitch noted that being the sixth largest bank in Nigeria, representing about six per cent of banking system assets at end of 2021, Fidelity\u2019s \u201cstrong balance sheet growth in recent years has improved market shares, which should rise further but remain below the five largest banks.\u201d\n\nIt however pointed out the high credit concentrations of the bank, saying \u201csingle-borrower credit concentration is high, with the 20 largest customer loans representing 43 per cent of gross loans and 270 per cent of Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-2021. This exposes the bank to event risk. Exposure to the oil and gas sector is also high, representing 26 per cent of gross loans and 160 per cent of FCC.\n\n\u201cFidelity\u2019s stage 3 loans ratio at 2.8 per cent at end-1Q22, has been supported by strong lending growth and is below the banking sector average. Specific loan loss allowance coverage of impaired loans at 72 per cent at end-1Q22, is healthy in view of collateral coverage. We expect the bank\u2019s impaired loans ratio to remain at around three per cent in 2022-2023, supported by stable operating conditions.\n\n\u201cOperating returns on risk-weighted assets (RWA) have averaged 2.1 per cent over the past four full years. They improved to 2.5 per cent in 2021 from 2.1 per cent in 2020, supported by a significant reduction in impairment charges. We expect profitability to continue improving on the back of higher interest rates and stable credit performance.\n\n\u201cFidelity\u2019s FCC ratio at 18.6 per cent at end-1Q22, is higher than most Nigerian medium and small banks and is considered adequate in view of its risk profile. The ratio declined from 19.1 per cent at end-2020 as a result of strong loan growth and lower internal capital generation driven by mark-to-market losses of N5 billion or two per cent of equity.\n\n\u201cThe customer deposit base comprises a fairly high percentage of current and savings accounts, 75 per cent of total deposits at end-2021 and a moderate proportion of consumer deposits (26 per cent).\n\n\u201cAccordingly, single-depositor concentration is high. Non-deposit funding is high by domestic standards, around 30 per cent of total funding at end-2021), reflecting Eurobond issuance of $800 million and funds for on-lending raised mainly from the Central Bank of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s quest to attain self-sufficiency in sugar production remains Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc\u2019s major priority.\n\nThe company is helping Nigeria towards self-sufficiency in sugar production by moving from importation and refining to creating new plantations with their own refining facilities, close to major centres of demand, with a target to produce 1.5 to 2.0 million tonnes of refined sugar annually by 2024 from over 150,000 hectares of locally grown sugar cane.\n\nThe Nigerian Sugar Master Plan of 2012 is the starting point for backward integration in the sector. The plan\u2019s objective was to boost domestic production of sugar to attain self-sufficiency by 2020 and to contribute to the production of ethanol and the generation of electricity.\n\nHowever, analysts noted that, supply chain bottlenecks across the various producing states have hindered government attempts to meet the 2020 targets, saying that another challenge stifling sugar output is the government\u2019s poor protection of the local sugar industry.\n\nProduction of sugar in Nigeria has continually lagged domestic demand, and this creates a huge supply gap that is largely bridged with importation.\n\nSpeaking recently at its 16th annual general meeting (AGM) in Lagos, the chairman of the company, Aliko Dangote, said the goal of Dangote Sugar Backward Integration Projects Master plan remains the achievement of 1.5 million MT annually from locally grown sugarcane in support of the quest for sugar sufficiency in the country by the federal government of Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that this will be achieved in addition to the extended value chain benefits that will be derived from the projects including thousands of jobs that will be generated in the sector from these projects.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cduring the year 2021, we continued in the implementation of this strategic initiative despite the spill-over impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activities which continued to affect the project performance and timelines.\n\nAccording to Dangote, \u201cefforts were made by all stakeholders to provide support that would help in cushioning these challenges during the period under review. Several teams from the supervising agencies and federal ministries took tours of our sugar backward integration sites, which helped them access and appreciate the volume of investments that have been made so far, the level of work done, progresses made and the challenges we are faced with in the project\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nHe however said: \u201cin spite of the challenges faced in the year 2021, Dangote Sugar Numan Operations rehabilitation and expansion efforts of the factory and field are advancing. The community issues that came up were effectively managed, and we have continued to advance so far without any major disruptions. Our Stakeholder Management teams across the Group are leading our corporate efforts and relationship between the Company and host communities remains cordial.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the factory upgrade to 3,800TCD completed in 2020, is now being upgraded with an additional 6,000TCD, which is at an advanced stage. This will bring the total installed factory capacity at the Numan operations to 9,800TCD in readiness for processing of sugarcane from the sugar estate farms that are being newly developed.\u201d\n\nHe assured of the company\u2019s commitment to the achievement of Sugar Backward integration projects, which is the future of the industry in Nigeria, saying this will keep us on our sustained growth path and we will continue to deliver and improve our quality service while delivering value to all stakeholders.\n\nAlso, the group managing director/chief executive officer of Dangote Sugar, Mr. Ravindra Singhvi said: \u201cwe remained ahead of the pack in implementation of the National Sugar backward Integration Development Master Plan.\u201d He said achievement of the Dangote Sugar Master Plan remained paramount in our operations.\n\nHe explained that \u201csteady progress is now being made as we continue the rehabilitation and expansion project at Dangote Sugar, Numan; and development activities at the Nasarawa Sugar Company Limited, Tunga. The board and management remain resolute and commitment to ensuring a sustainable future for our business with the Dangote Sugar Master Plan.\u201d\n\nSinghvi added that the implementation of the sugar projects initiatives continue at a high tempo despite the challenges the company face, ranging from the inability to access the land acquired for the sugar projects, community unrests and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic negative impact on the economic activities.\n\nHe also said: \u201cwe recorded some wins with the peaceful resolution of most issues with the communities and the continued positive engagement with the States and Communities stakeholders that are evident in the successes being recorded at the project sites. We remain confident that the backward integration programme will deliver huge benefits and positive impacts on the country\u2019s economic land scape.\u201d\n\nDangote Sugar Refinery, the largest sugar refinery in sub-Saharan Africa and one of the largest in the world, with an installed sugar refining capacity of 1.44 MT/PA at the same location.

          "text": "Air Peace Airline, over the weekend, announced the gifting of free local and international flying tickets to the 1980 National Football team and 1976 Olympians.\n\nAir Peace spokesman, Stanley Olisa, in a statement, indicated the chairman of Air Peace, Barrister Allen Onyema, pledged to build a Wall of Fame for Nigeria\u2019s distinguished sports icons whose strides played a tremendous role in unifying the country, projecting her in a favourable light and representing the entire Black race positively.\n\nOnyema, who was represented by executive director, Air Peace, Nnenna Onyema, said Air Peace will sponsor the building of a \u201cWall of Fame where the names of our sports heroes of the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games and those of others who have won laurels for our dear nation, beginning with the then Green Eagles and our national football team that won the African Cup of Nations for Nigeria for the first time in our history, will be displayed.\u201d\n\nOnyema was honoured for his humanitarian act of rescuing Nigerians in South Africa amidst xenophobic attacks and his immense contributions to the Nigerian economy through job creation.\n\nHe said: \u201cwe cannot adequately promote FESTAC of Sports without, in one way or another, recognising and honouring our sports heroes and those who have made such huge sacrifices through sports for the good of Africa and the Black race in general.\n\n\u201cTo this end therefore, Air Peace shall sponsor the building of a Wall of Fame where the names of our sports heroes of the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games and those of others who have won laurels for our dear nation, beginning with the then Green Eagles and our national football team that won the African Cup of Nations for Nigeria for the first time in our history, will be displayed.\n\nThose that won sporting laurels in various sporting events like the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and subsequent African Cup of Nations will also be included in this Wall of Fame, he promised.\n\n\u201cFor the 1980 National Football team referred to above, Air Peace shall sponsor an event where they would be celebrated and honoured. The surviving members of that team are hereby made Special Ambassadors of Air Peace and are entitled, for the rest of their lives, to fly Air Peace free of charge, six times in every year on the domestic destinations and once a year to any foreign destination serviced by Air Peace.\n\n\u201cOn the night of celebrations in their honour, Air Peace shall equally give out certain financial rewards to all members of that team including the heirs or spouses of the deceased ones amongst them.\u201d\n\nNoting that sports have become a potent tool not only for national peace, unity, and cohesion but also a powerful channel for international relations and diplomacy.\n\nOnyema explained that these iconic past sportsmen and women are being honoured in recognition of the powerful tool that football has become in fostering unity in Nigeria.

Above all, my attributes as a unifier and bridge-builder will stand us in good stead in this era characterised by disunity and absence of inclusion,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to the former vice-president, \u201cOur opponents will want to confuse you with alternative facts as we progress and when the campaign starts in full. But I will urge you to always reman focused and remember that this is not why we are in the race.\n\n\u201cThe urgency of the job to get Nigeria back on her feet as ONE People, with One Future and ONE Country cannot give us the luxury of playing to the gallery.\n\n\u201cMy promise to you as we run this race together is that as your candidate, I shall ensure that we remain focused and disciplined. And I shall expect the same spirit of sportsmanship from you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former vice president said the 2023 election was neither about him nor any of the other candidates that he was contesting with or their agents, rather, he said, \u201cIt is about the pathway that our dear country, Nigeria, must chart into a brighter and more prosperous future.\u201d\n\nCommending the judgement, Atiku said, it was one of the ways to affirm the independence of the judiciary in Nigeria\n\nThe supreme court had struck out the suit challenging section 84(12) of Electoral Act.\n\nAbubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, on behalf of the federal government, had filed a suit challenging that section of the Electoral Act, 2022 on the grounds that it violated the rights of political appointees.\n\nThe section read: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nIn the judgment delivered on Friday, a seven-member pane of judges led by Musa Dattijo-Muhammad, dismissed the suit, describing it as an abuse of court process.\n\nIn his reaction, however, the former vice-president, said, \u201cthe ruling of the Supreme Court on Section 84 (12) is commendable.\n\n\u201cIt affirms my position of the independence of the judiciary and the other arms of government, namely the legislature and the executive, which is the bedrock for the development of any nation.\n\n\u2018Under no circumstance must one arm lord over another arm of government,\u201d Atiku wrote on his verified tweeter handle.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nExperts at a One-Day Interactive Workshop on Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN, have asserted the obvious fact that an effective service delivery in the sector was dependent on the quality of practitioners and their professional competence.\n\nIn the paper titled \u2018Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals\u2019 presented at the occasion, Alhaji Abdulmalik Hassan, an advocate for quality service, stated that excellent customer service delivered in the appropriate way, is a prerequisite for effective and efficient business management that guarantees customer satisfaction, patronage and retention.\n\nHassan said service delivery in the tourism and hospitality industry deserves much more than it has because, due to lapses in the manner and way personnel and staff of individual tourism and hospitality organizations conduct themselves with customers, they end up losing customer patronage and running down their businesses, noting that we take for granted the way the gateman and receptionist welcome guests, and that once the guest does not receive an amiable reception from the on-set at the entry point, the organization losses the ability to command customer satisfaction let alone retain customer patronage.\n\nIn his submission, the tourism expert advocated for more attention on training and equipping lower cadre staff with the necessary skills to deliver better customer service than the current trends in which most organizations spend huge resources training their top executives.\n\nAnother facilitator at the occasion, Capt. Emmanuel LordsGreat who delivered a paper on \u2018Re-Inventing Customer Experience for Tourism and Hospitality Industry\u2019 posited that businesses have changed from manufacturing dependence to providing timely and quality service, and that due to increase in technology and globalization, there has been a dramatic change in customer behaviour which service providers must understand and come to terms with.\n\nLordsGreat stressed that Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the need to get value for their money and will frown at poor quality service delivery from mediocre organizations. This therefore meant that hospitality and tourism organizations must work on customer satisfaction and retention efforts which were key to keeping them from running away.\n\n\u201d What drive customers away is rude and discourteous behaviour, inept, and incompetence dispositions of staff during service delivery,\u201d he added.\n\nHe alluded that knowing the obvious fact that customers are the most important people to an organization, and also that organizations depend on customers not the other way round and are in fact the lifeblood of an organization, taking measures to serve them to the best of their satisfaction was fundamental and should not be compromised.\n\nAlso the Director General of the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism, Nura Sani Kangiwa, who was the special Guest of Honour at the occasion, represented by Dr. Taiwo Famogbiyele, Director, General Studies, Research and Development, delivered the keynote address in which he affirmed that the success of harnessing the country\u2019s tourism potentials through effective service delivery was highly dependent on the quality of professionals and practitioners in the sector, noting that there was urgent need for adequate sensitization in terms of education and impacting of relevant training and skills to the personnel and drivers of the industry such as the one organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address, convener of the workshop and Chairman of the FCT Chapter of ITPN, Dr. Mrs. Ebikaboere Seimodei said a flourishing tourism industry can only be achieved via quality service delivery which the country stands to benefit from its economic values such as generating income, providing job opportunities, ensuring foreign exchange earnings, increase in internally generated revenue via taxation and the attendant multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, and when service delivery was poor, the result will be dwindling fortunes in the industry and low economic value to the national economy.\n\nSeimodei then called on practitioners in the industry to support efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN in capacity development for enhanced service delivery, particularly in this age of increased technological skills and changing visitor/consumer preferences as well as meet the expectations of tourists in conformity with global best practices.\n\nOther guests who gave goodwill messages at the occasion includes Chief Abiodun Odusanwo, National President of ITPN; Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, President of the National Association of Nigerian Travel Agents, NANTA and Barr. Funmi Kazeem, Hotel Owners Forum of Abuja, HOFA; who praised efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN by bringing to the front burner the issue of training and re-training of practitioners in the industry for better and quality service delivery by professionals in the sector.\n\nCertificates were later presented to participants at the workshop as testimony of attendance and acquisition of the requisite knowledge and skills in the ethics of customer service delivery as professionals in the travel tourism and hospitality industry.",

          "title": "APC, PDP Have Failed Nigerians, Not Fit for Governance, Says NNPP Candidate Kwankwaso",
          "text": "Former governor of Kano state and presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) for the 2023 election, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are no longer fit for governance, having allegedly failed the populace.\n\nThe former Defence Minister, urged Nigerians to reject the candidates of the two main parties in 2023 presidential election on the premise that their respective political parties had failed the nation woefully over the years.\n\nThe former governor argued that the parties had performed abysmally in delivering dividends of democracy to the people, saying this reflects in the level of insecurity, joblessness, economic deprivation and hardship that are pervading the land.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nKwankwaso, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, during a consultation visit to the state at the weekend, lamented the decayed infrastructure in the country, as manifested the deplorable Akure-Ado road.\n\nHe knocked the APC-led federal and state governments for abandoning the people to suffer on the road.\n\nCalling on the people to have trust in the NNPP to transform the country and place it on the right path to progress, he explained that the party had been experiencing surge in membership in the last few months since he joined the platform.\n\nHe stated that the rising cases of insecurity across the country and excruciating economic policies, which he said had resulted in poverty, unemployment, inflation were enough reasons for the people to reject the ruling party, adding, \u201cthe way we are going now is one way to disaster in the country.\u201d\n\nKwankwaso who represented Kano Central in the Eighth National Assembly said, \u201cThis our party was registered about 21 years ago but in the last four months when I joined the party, so many people have joined us and that is why we have structures everywhere across the country. Not only that so many people have even registered including in Ekiti state.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the performance of the APC and PDP and all of us believe that they have failed the country woefully and nobody should expect anything from them again. These people in the two parties have failed and failed woefully, they have nothing to offer.\n\n\u201cLook at the road from Akure to Ado-Ekiti, it is in a very terrible and deplorable situation. You go around any of these cities, Abuja and other areas, you hardly see anything happening, poverty is at the highest level in this country, insecurity also at its peak and we can\u2019t continue like that, because the way we are going now is one way to disaster in the country.\n\n\u201cSo, the only way to avert that disaster is for Nigerians to go and sell the ideas of NNPP, which is a progressive party and vote for the party come 2023.\u201d\n\nOn the speculations relating to alliance with the PDP ahead of the 2023 election, the former Kano state governor who denied the insinuations, alleged that the main opposition party has no clear-cut agenda for the nation, saying he would never return to his past.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget we have candidates across board now in NNPP ahead of the 2023 elections, so you will expect me to leave and join others in the PDP?\n\n\u201cIt is not going to happen. I was a foundation member of the two major parties and they have nothing to offer again, that is why I left them and I can\u2019t go back,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yakubu Ajaka, has said it was impossible for the former Governor of Kano State to become president of Nigeria with a sectional party like the NNPP.\n\nAjaka, who said Kwankwaso should return to the ruling party, which he helped to build and had great chance to ride on to becoming president, however, dismissed the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, as good customers to the APC during elections.\n\nSpeaking with journalists yesterday in Abuja, Ajaka, said it was not too late for Kwankwaso to retrace his steps, stressing that winning one or two states in the North West would not make him the president.\n\n\u201cKwankwaso knew about the formation of APC, he contributed immensely to its success in 2015 and our leaders hope to repay him at the appropriate time but he cannot be outside to be a beneficiary in the nearest future.\n\n\u201cSo, that is why I said it\u2019s not too late for him to return to the APC. That\u2019s where he naturally belongs and has an assurance of becoming a president one day, and not his current sectional NNPP.\n\n\u201cAlthough some people might be deceiving him by calling him Mr. President already, but just one or two states in the North West cannot make him a president. Kwankwaso needs a national party like APC to achieve his presidential ambition. So, I plead to him to do the needful before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Ajaka said.\n\nThe APC chieftain noted that the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, was only enjoying sectional sympathy at the moment, stressing that when campaign starts, Nigerians would differentiate between boys and men in politics.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cJust like Kwankwaso, Peter Obi is only enjoying sectional sympathy but a real presidential candidate needs to enjoy acceptability from all parts of the country. So, we believe that Peter Obi should enjoy his social media frenzy for now before the real campaign starts very soon.\u201d\n\nAjaka pointed out that he didn\u2019t see both the PDP and its presidential candidate as formidable opponent going into the 2023 elections\n\nHe noted that the opposition party would make all the noise without facts and enjoy its propaganda for a while, but Nigerian voters would eventually distinguish between PDP\u2019s lies and APC\u2019s record of achievements.\n\nHe further added that, the PDP and Atiku, were good customers to APC, who could not go beyond coming second at any election, stressing that, even that second position was threatened with the recent result Ekiti governorship election.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",

          "text": "Troops in Sri Lanka handed tokens on Monday to people queueing for petrol amid a severe fuel shortage in the nation battling its worst economic crisis in seven decades, while schools shut in Colombo and public employees were asked to work from home.\n\nWith its foreign exchange reserves at a record low, the island of 22 million is struggling to pay for essential imports of food, medicine and most critically, fuel.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cI have been in line for four days, I haven\u2019t slept or eaten properly during this time,\u201d said autorickshaw driver W.D. Shelton, 67, one of those who received a token meant to hold his place in the queue for when fuel becomes available.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t earn, we can\u2019t feed our families,\u201d added Shelton, who was 24th in line at a fuel station in the centre of Colombo, but set to stay there as he had no petrol for the journey to his home just 5 km (3 miles) away.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how far the government could stretch its fuel reserves.\n\nThe stockpiles stand at about 9,000 tonnes of diesel and 6,000 tonnes of petrol, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said on Sunday, but no fresh shipments are due.\n\nThe government has told employees to work from home until further notice, while schools have been shut for a week in the commercial capital of Colombo and surrounding areas.\n\nFuel station queues have grown rapidly since last week.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy, we don\u2019t know where this will end,\u201d Shelton said.\n\nPublic transport, power generation and medical services will get priority in fuel distribution, with some rationed to ports and airports.\n\nA team from the International Monetary Fund is visiting Sri Lanka to hold talks on a $3-billion bailout package.\n\nAlthough the Indian Ocean nation is hoping to reach a staff-level agreement before the visit ends on Thursday, that is unlikely to unlock any immediate funds.\n\nReuters",
