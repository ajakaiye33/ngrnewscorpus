          "text": "The Southern Kaduna Peoples Union on Thursday distributed various relief materials to natives of 36 Adara communities in the Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe natives were recently displaced by armed herdsmen attacks.\n\nItems distributed include bags of rice, beans, maize, gari, noodles, pasta, food seasoning, and salt.\n\nOther items are cartons of vegetable oil, bags of sugar, cartons of Vaseline and soaps including children\u2019s pampas. The materials are valued at N12.8 million.\n\nSOKAPU\u2019s National President, Hon Jonathan Asake, told the IDPs that they were people who cared much about their plight and had donated to their welfare.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am here with my team, to express our solidarity with you and to bring you goodwill from Governor Nyesom Wike of River State who came to Kaduna in April for campaigns and donated to the IDPs in the state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have followed the cruelty that you have had to face in the hands of marauding armed herdsmen and your subsequent displacements, which has also attracted the sympathy of Gov.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is more likely to spread in mass gatherings and when people do not adhere to preventive measures such as physical distancing, mask use, and hand hygiene.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate, we urge Nigerians to prevent the onset of a full-fledged fifth COVID-19 wave by remaining mindful of the high risk of spread of COVID-19 and acting in tandem by adhering to recommended public health safety measures.\u201d",

          "title": "Furore over \u2018missing\u2019 72 tractors in Niger State",
          "text": "By Wole Mosadomi, Minna\n\n\n\nNIGER State is particularly famous for the agricultural activities of its people. And this possibly explains why within a period of 15 years successive governments in the state had procured about 500 tractors to boost mechanised farming and open up rural roads within the state. For example, the immediate past administration under the leadership of Dr. Muazu Babangida Aliyu took delivery of 200 units of tractors to enhance mechanised farming and also to rehabilitate feeder roads within the 25 local government areas of the state under his tenure.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, his successor and present administration of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello in June 2018 took delivery of 130 tractors at a cost of N2.2billion which was distributed to \u201cgenuine\u201d farmers at 25 percent subsidy to boost food production not only in the state alone but in the country. The governor during the flagging off of the farming season in 2018 also revealed that \u201dadditional one hundred tractors are being expected through the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending, NIRSAL\u201d.\n\n\n\nOn July 2, 2018 during the flag-off of the construction/rehabilitation of rural roads under the second phase of the construction of 403 rural roads under the implementation of rural access mobility project-II (RAMP-2) at Kampani Bobi in Mariga local government area, the governor declared that opening up rural roads and boosting agriculture through mechanisation was going to be his priority, hence, the huge investment by his administration on the Tractors.\n\n\n\nGovernor Bello declared then that: \u201dIn the first phase of this project, we were able to record the rehabilitation of 176km rural roads. In addition, 20 river crossing bridges were also constructed which greatly facilitated linkage of several communities in the State. This further boosted the socio-economic activities in the benefiting rural communities. The administration is working out modalities for surface dressing of these roads due to traffic build up on the routes so as to increase their lifespan.\n\n\n\nThe governor regretted that local government councils in the state have not lived up to expectations in the construction of feeder roads despite the procurement of heavy duty earth-moving equipment few years ago. He directed them to resuscitate their various works departments in order to meet peoples\u2019 demand for capital projects, especially in the area of roads construction. According to him: \u201cSome of these heavy equipment can be used to constructs or grade most of our roads in the rural areas. The people are not asking for much, they need their roads to be graded and culvets provided in some place\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe therefore directed the local government chairmen to repair the over 25 earth-moving equipment abandoned at councils secretariats over the years pointing out that they should cultivate maintenance culture in order to avoid wastage of government funds.\n\nThis public declaration by the Governor actually raised the hope of the residents, who became expectant of more of the rehabilitation of their roads, while farmers looked forward to more tractors to boost their farming. That has however become history as the hopes of the people had been dashed. Indeed, there are agitations by members of the public who are eager to know what has become of the tractors purchased by previous administrations and the present one.\n\n\n\nJust last week, the state House of Assembly set up a seven-man committee to investigate the alleged disappearance of over 72 tractors belonging to the 25 local government areas of the state.\n\n\n\nThis followed a Matter of Urgent Public Importance moved at plenary on Tuesday, last week by Abdulmalik Madaki Bosso, member representing Bosso Constituency in the state House of Assembly.\n\nBosso had declared that on May 23, 2022, the Niger State chapter of Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, NULGE, wrote a letter informing the Speaker of the House of Assembly, complaining of the disappearance of over 72 tractors belonging to the state local governments.\n\n\n\nThe lawmaker further explained that on July 26, 2018, the Ministry for Local Government, via a letter with a reference No. MLGCO/N/569/1/3 with caption: \u201cProposal For Refurbishment of Local Government Tractors,\u201d mandated the 25 local government councils to submit the said over 72 tractors to one Messr Dangaroga Allah for refurbishment.\n\n\n\nBosso added that four years after the tractors were taken to Messr Dangaroga Allah for refurbishment, they are yet to be delivered back to the state for onward delivery to the respective local government areas and that no congent reason had been given why the tractors have not been returned.\n\nThe lawmaker thereby called on the House to as a matter of urgency and sincerity of purpose investigate the circumstances leading to the sudden disappearance of the tractors.\n\n\n\nIn a swift reaction, the state government declared that there are no missing tractors as being alleged in some quarters.\n\n\n\nCommissioner for Local Government, Community Development and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Kabiru Abbas Musa who disclosed this while briefing journalists at the Government House, Minna, said there was no record to show that the Ministry had entered into agreement with any contractor for the repairs of its tractors, 61 of which he said belong to the 25 local governments talk less of talking of disappearance.\n\n\n\nAccording to him: \u201dThe tractors are intact and available. Governance is a diligent process which has adherence to due process as such could not understand why someone is claiming N100m without any contract agreement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso at the briefing, the state Commissioner for Agricultural and Rural Development, Alhaji Yusuf Mohammed Gunu, said the ministry has auctioned out 103 of the tractors stressing thus: \u201cThe auction became necessary because most of them have outlived their lifespan and have turned to scrap as they have spent over 20 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn doing this, the Board of Surveyors followed due process in ensuring transparency during the auctioning and some of the tractors were sold between N2m to N2.5m. The unserviceable tractors met all the terms for auctioning and those that bought them are expected to further provide a social responsibility for their communities by making the tractors available for hiring to them,\u201d he declared. However, even with these explations from the state government, members of the public are not satisfied as the question continued to be asked in different quarters: \u201dWhere are our tractors? If they are available, we want to see them back in our different local government areas where they are needed\u201d.",
          "summary": "And this possibly explains why within a period of 15 years successive governments in the state had procured about 500 tractors to boost mechanised farming and open up rural roads within the state.\nJust last week, the state House of Assembly set up a seven-man committee to investigate the alleged disappearance of over 72 tractors belonging to the 25 local government areas of the state.\nThis followed a Matter of Urgent Public Importance moved at plenary on Tuesday, last week by Abdulmalik Madaki Bosso, member representing Bosso Constituency in the state House of Assembly.\nMLGCO/N/569/1/3 with caption: \u201cProposal For Refurbishment of Local Government Tractors,\u201d mandated the 25 local government councils to submit the said over 72 tractors to one Messr Dangaroga Allah for refurbishment.\nIn a swift reaction, the state government declared that there are no missing tractors as being alleged in some quarters.",

I\u2019m not the kind of prophet who gives or reveals what God says because of popularity or fame. Anyone God has not announced that announcing himself would become a tragedy. What I saw this morning was so scary to me. I saw an attack on Nigerian airports and it caused a lot of disarrays.\n\n\u201dIt looked like a bomb blast and people were running from pillar to post. It was as if the bombing was being shifted from one airport to another; from Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport to Kaduna airport and Muritala International Airport and it was very bloody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose at the helm of affairs should take note of this, particularly these three airports. They should know that there is a plan of an attack on Nigerian airports. I\u2019m not here to scare anyone, I\u2019m only saying the mind of God. God usually sends His prophet in order for things not to be in disarray. The incident will soon happen if care is not taken. Security agencies should take note of this.

          "text": "A socio-political group ,Abia North Peace Foundation, (ANPF) has lambasted Senator Mao Ohuabunwa for attempting to use insecurity in Abia State to score cheap political points.\n\nThe group said Ohuabunwa\u2019s attempt to campaign with insecurity in Abia North is shameful knowing that he achieved nothing for the 12 years he spent at the national assembly.\n\nThe group while reacting to Ohuabunwa\u2019s attack on Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, accused him of over heating the polity ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nChief Nnanna Ukaegbu, the group\u2019s National Coordinator in a statement on Thursday evening urged Ohuabunwa to be courageous enough to tell Abians that Governor Okezie Ikpeazu is the Chief Security Officer of the State.\n\n\u201cSo Ohuabunwa wants to win election with dirty propaganda? It won\u2019t work! Ohuabunwa should be bold enough to tell Abians that his friend, Okezie Ikpeazu is the Chief Security Officer of Abia State. He should also urge the deputy governoship candidate of the PDP, Okey Igwe \u2014 who is also the House of Assembly member representing Umunneochi to speak up for his people. What is the job of the Local Government Chairman there? What is he doing to tackle the insecurity in his area? Mao Ohuabunwa should be bold enough to call their names. Why is he channeling his energy on Senator Orji Uzor Kalu without even mentioning Nkeiruka Onyejeocha who is from Umunneochi Local Government Area?\n\nOhuabunwa is going to be politically retired in 2023; Senator Orji Uzor Kalu won\u2019t descend into the gutter with him. It is too early for him to start weeping now. It is better for him to save his tears ahead of the general election because the humiliation would be too much for him to handle.\n\n\u201cFrom Umunneochi down to Arochukwu, we shall humiliate him with our votes. We expected him to share his scorecard from 1999-2007 and 2015-2019 respectively.\n\n\u201cObviously, he has nothing to offer other than overheating the polity by using insecurity to incite the masses.

Why didn\u2019t Ohuabunwa attack Governor Okezie Ikpeazu who is the Chief Security Officer of Abia State in his statement?\n\n\u201cHis attack on Kalu clearly shows he has been rejected by all including his Arochukwu kinsmen.

          "text": "NARA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a divisive arch-conservative and one of his nation\u2019s most powerful and influential figures, has died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in western Japan, according to NHK public television.\n\nAbe, 67, was shot from behind minutes after he started his speech in Nara. He was airlifted to a hospital for emergency treatment but was not breathing and his heart had stopped. He was pronounced dead later at the hospital, NHK said.\n\nPolice arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of an attack that shocked many in Japan, which is one of the world\u2019s safest nations and has some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida and his Cabinet ministers hastily returned to Tokyo from campaign events around the country after the shooting, which he called \u201cdastardly and barbaric.\u201d\n\nAbe was Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader before stepping down in 2020.\n\nNHK aired a dramatic video of Abe giving a speech outside a train station in the western city of Nara. He is standing, dressed in a navy blue suit, raising his fist, when two gunshots are heard. The video then shows Abe collapsed on the street, with security guards running toward him. He holds his chest, his shirt smeared with blood.\n\nIn the next moment, security guards leap on top of a man in gray shirt who lies face down on the pavement. A double-barreled device that appeared to be a handmade gun is seen on the ground.\n\nNara prefectural police confirmed the arrest of Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, on suspicion of attempted murder. NHK reported that the suspect served in the Maritime Self-Defense Force for three years in the 2000s.\n\nOther videos from the scene showed campaign officials surrounding Abe. The former leader was still highly influential in the governing Liberal Democratic Party and headed its largest faction, Seiwakai. Elections for Japan\u2019s upper house, the less powerful chamber of its parliament, are Sunday.\n\n\u201cI use the harshest words to condemn (the act),\u201d Kishida said as he struggled to control his emotions. He said the government planned to review the security situation, but added that Abe had the highest protection.\n\nOpposition leaders condemned the attack as a challenge to Japan\u2019s democracy. In Tokyo, people stopped on the street to grab extra editions of newspapers or watch TV coverage of the shooting.\n\nWhen he resigned as prime minister, Abe said he had a recurrence of the ulcerative colitis he\u2019d had since he was a teenager.\n\nHe told reporters at the time that it was \u201cgut wrenching\u201d to leave many of his goals unfinished. He spoke of his failure to resolve the issue of Japanese abducted years ago by North Korea, a territorial dispute with Russia and a revision of Japan\u2019s war-renouncing constitution.\n\nThat last goal was a big reason he was such a divisive figure.\n\nHis ultra-nationalism riled the Koreas and China, and his push to create what he saw as a more normal defense posture angered many Japanese. Abe failed to achieve his cherished goal of formally rewriting the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution because of poor public support.\n\nLoyalists said that his legacy was a stronger U.S.-Japan relationship that was meant to bolster Japan\u2019s defense capability. But Abe made enemies by forcing his defense goals and other contentious issues through parliament, despite strong public opposition.\n\nAbe was a political blue blood who was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. His political rhetoric often focused on making Japan a \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d nation with a stronger military and bigger role in international affairs.\n\nMany foreign officials expressed shock over the shooting.\n\nAbe said he was proud of working while leader for a stronger Japan-U.S. security alliance and shepherding the first visit by a serving U.S. president to the atom-bombed city of Hiroshima. He also helped Tokyo gain the right to host the 2020 Olympics by pledging that a disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant was \u201cunder control\u201d when it was not.\n\nAbe became Japan\u2019s youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, but his overly nationalistic first stint abruptly ended a year later, also because of his health.\n\nThe end of Abe\u2019s scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of \u201crevolving door\u201d politics that lacked stability and long-term policies.\n\nWhen he returned to office in 2012, Abe vowed to revitalize the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his \u201cAbenomics\u201d formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms.\n\nHe won six national elections and built a rock-solid grip on power, bolstering Japan\u2019s defense role and capability and its security alliance with the U.S. He also stepped up patriotic education at schools and raised Japan\u2019s international profile.",

All the other personnel, staff and vehicles made it safely to Daura,\u201d Garba Shehu, a presidential spokesman had said in a statement.\n\nAlso on Tuesday night, terrorists attacked Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, the nation's capital, killing some of the inmates and an official of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).\n\nThe assailants freed hundreds of inmates including Boko Haram terrorists held at the prison facility.\n\nThe Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) on Wednesday claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack on the prison facility.\n\nIn a video, the terrorist group showed some of its men shooting their way into the facility.\n\nHowever, a source on Thursday told SaharaReporters that the President would be in Daura on Friday for the Eid-El-Kabir celebration despite the terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cBuhari will return to Daura tomorrow for Salah.

          "text": "A Northern youth group under the umbrella of Arewa Youths Progressive Alliance has dissociated itself from a statement by the presidential candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, that Northerners would not vote for Peter Obi of the Labour Party.\n\nKwankwaso had a few days ago said that voters from the North would not vote for the former Governor of Anambra State and presidential candidate of Labour Party, Obi or any candidate from the Southeast but rather vote for presidential candidates from the Northern region, when they have such an option.\n\nReacting to the statement, the group\u2019s spokesman, Alhaji Sambo Galadima, in a statement released in Kaduna on Thursday condemned Kwankwaso\u2019s comment, saying that \u201cthe North is neither anti-progress nor xenophobic against other Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to Galadima, the statement by Kwankwaso who is a former Governor of Kano State was not only disrespectful to the Northern region but also misrepresented the true characters of an average northern voter.\n\nThe group noted that Kwankwaso\u2019s utterances portrayed the North as retrogressive.\n\nThe spokesperson said, \u201cDr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso\u2019s utterances portray the North as retrogressive and the average northern voter as insensitive and unconcerned about the sufferings of Nigerians and the high rate of insecurity and economic woes bedevilling Nigeria, and rather concerned about having \u2018fellow northerner and fellow Muslim\u2019 perpetuate themselves in power.\n\n\u201cNothing can be farther from the truth. The northerner experiences the same level of frustration with the state of governance in the country that the average Nigerian from any part of Nigeria experiences and wishes like every Nigerian that things improve for the better and that the most capable and most prepared individuals take charge of governance at different levels, including the presidency of the country, for the betterment of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGaladima asked if the \u201cNorth fared any better in infrastructure or living standards merely because a Northerner or a Muslim is the President of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe former governor of Kano State insults the North by portraying us as some insensitive group of people without the capacity to think for ourselves. This is not true. He sends the impression out there that our votes are owned by some elites and that it is these elites who will decide how we will vote in every election.\n\n\u201cIf that was true in the past, that is set to change, because we are not slaves. We are capable of dreaming and holding strongly to our dreams. We are capable of working for and participating actively in political activities, independently and with the aim of bringing about the kind of government that shall serve the best interest of the average Nigerian.\n\n\u201cIn the last seven years, more than 100,000 Northerners have been killed by bandits and terrorists, and thousands of our daughters, wives, mothers and sisters have either been raped, abducted or forcefully married out.\n\n\u201cOur farms are lying fallow and our harvests haven\u2019t been poorer. Yet, a Northerner is the President. We voted for this Northerner, not because he is a Northerner, but because we believed he had the best of intentions and had the capacity to turn things around for good, for the benefit of all Nigerians. But we are disappointed,\u201d the group added.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure fellow Nigerians that Northern Nigeria is not some kind of slave colony where some elites drag us by the neck to vote on the basis of sectionalism or religion. We shall vote for the best candidates who hold the best promise to recharge Nigeria and get her working again, because, like every responsible citizen, we want the best interest of our country and we want a brighter future for our children,\u201d the group assured.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Nigerian hospitals explore deceased-donor kidney transplant",
          "text": "With kidney failure on the rise in Nigeria, hospitals are exploring the deceased-donor transplant option as organ donation, which is often transactional, from living donors remains low.\n\nThey are pushing for a highly regulated cadaveric system to take root as the primary source of kidney transplantation, a process where people can offer their organs for the use of others after they have been certified dead.\n\nHealth facilities with the capacity for renal care are recording increases in late presentation of cases which may lead to permanent placement on dialysis treatment or transplantation.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s findings show that a new dialysis unit, which opened only a few months ago at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), is currently oversubscribed due to a plethora of kidney problems.\n\nAt the Federal Medical Centre, Ebute-Meta, cases seeking dialysis daily are on the rise, especially among young people and those challenged by long-standing cases of hypertension, diabetes, or inflammation of the kidney.\n\nAlmost two in every 10 Nigerian adults suffer either chronic or acute kidney failure, according to the Nigerian Association of Nephrology (NAN).\n\nDialysis has remained the most common and accessible form of treatment in the country, even though many do not make it through either as a result of financial constraints or deterioration of their condition. Only a few well-heeled patients are able to get kidney donation in a process that some experts worry could have been induced by financial rewards.\n\nExperts say there is a wave of cadaveric organ donation being explored across the world, and Nigeria can benefit from it.\n\nAdetokunbo Fabamwo, LASUTH\u2019s chief medical director, said in an interview that while the laws that guide the process are currently being pushed at the Lagos State House of Assembly for ratification, the hospital is also building structures to begin trials.\n\n\u201cWe have already designed how we are going to do it. We are going to keep a register of people that need kidneys and another register of those that want to donate. We will set up a unit that is going to manage it. We can do it,\u201d the director said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge about transplant is the donor. A lot of relations do not like to donate to their relatives. So they are looking for commercial donors. We don\u2019t encourage that. If you are going to have a transplant in LASUTH, you must bring a relative who will consent to donate. Nigeria should have very strict regulations about donation.\u201d\n\nHe explained that through the system, people before they die, if suffering from some other fatal illnesses that do not affect their kidney, could sign up for donation. Immediately after they die, the kidney can be removed for someone who has been waiting for a kidney, he said.\n\nOlugbenga Awobusuyi, president-elect of NAN and the Transplant Society of Nigeria, similarly explained that the primary donor source in advanced countries has shifted to organs from deceased individuals.\n\nAccording to him, the organs used are those from people who die in the hospital, mostly those in the intensive care unit and are being maintained on life support.\n\n\u201cTheir brains can die but because they are on life support, we are able to assist the breathing and beating of the heart of the dead person. We can sustain the function of other organs, even though the brain is dead,\u201d the nephrology expert said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if we can have such a programme in the country, it is going to benefit society a lot, in that people don\u2019t have to buy organs. Organs from dead people are highly regulated strictly by established criteria.\u201d\n\nFor instance, in the United States, hospitals are required to have written agreements with organisations that coordinate organ and tissue donation and recovery. There are 58 organ procurement organisations, according to the US Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention.\n\nFor screening and testing, organ and tissue recovery organisations are required to obtain a medical and social history of deceased donors by asking their next-of-kin, and sometimes other persons who knew the potential donor, questions about behaviours that may have exposed the potential donor to certain diseases. This questionnaire serves as one of several resources to assess the donor\u2019s risk for having a disease.\n\nHospitals are required to evaluate living potential kidney donors for the presence of behaviours or medical history that may increase the risk of infection in the donor.\n\nRead also: Police rescue kidnapped Italian priest in Edo\n\nHospitals that perform organ recovery from kidney donors are also required to perform certain tests to see if the potential donor may have infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, syphilis, and cytomegalovirus. These test results are provided to the healthcare facility where transplantation of the organ or tissue will occur.\n\nAwobusuyi said NAN had been pushing the adoption across the country, with Lagos State leading the charge.\n\nDrivers of kidney failure\n\nFabamwo lamented that many are drinking different sorts of toxic concoctions that are being sold by traditional vendors, without minding the toll it takes on their health.\n\nHe listed the abuse of some medications, hypertension, and diabetes as some of the commonest causes of kidney failure, saying people are not checking their blood pressure and sugar levels until the kidneys are affected.\n\nOlamide Olowoyo, consultant nephrologist and head of Nephrology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Federal Medical Centre Ebute-Metta, said the prevalence of chronic kidney disease now ranges between 11 and about 15 percent.\n\nAccording to him, unlike what happens in other countries where it is mainly elderly people who suffer chronic kidney failure, \u201cin Nigeria, we tend to have a younger population who are the economically productive population. Ours is a bit worse\u201d.\n\nShe said the inflammation of the kidney, HIV, hereditary kidney diseases, toxic concoction and obstruction of the urinary tract are also drivers.\n\nOlowoyo said one of her patients, a security officer, who should get routine dialysis every week only appears twice due to lack of funds.",

          "text": "Next month, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), advertised as the elixir for new investments into the sector, would be a year old, but investors are fleeing Nigeria due to industrial-scale crude theft, uncertainty and the government\u2019s inability to fully implement the act, operators say.\n\nPanel after panel at the Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference, which was held in Abuja from July 4 \u2013 7, turned into a jeremiad on Nigeria\u2019s spectacular failure to take advantage of its abundant oil and gas resources to lift its people out of poverty.\n\nOsagie Okunbor, managing director of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd and country chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, said a lack of stability in fiscal terms, issues with the sanctity of contracts, security of investments, and the sheer impact of crude theft continued to scare away investors.\n\nHe spent some time lauding the passage of the PIA, saying, however imperfect it was, it had brought some sort of clarity. Other international oil companies\u2019 (IOCs) representatives on the panel including Mike Sangster, managing director of TotalEnergies Nigeria, agreed.\n\nClearly not enough to attract investment dollars even as the IOCs continued to pour money into other jurisdictions. Shell is participating in the North Field East LNG expansion project in Qatar. Shell Australia took a final investment decision for the development of the Crux natural gas field, off the coast of Western Australia and Shell Brasil signed a Production Sharing Contract to formally acquire a 25 percent stake of the Atapu field, paying $ 1.1 billion to Petrobras for the increased stake in the field.\n\nExxonMobil has spent a fortune in Guyana developing new fields while TotalEnergies is showing the cash in new projects in Uganda and Tanzania.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that we have the PIA and the full impact on investments will take some time to materialise,\u201d Okunbor said.\n\nBut it sounded like industry-speak for when the government is ready to be serious, investors will come.\n\nAnalysts say the Nigerian government has done little to fix the vexing issues in the oil sector. It took it 20 years to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill, and it\u2019s taken one year to even commence the implementation of most of its provisions.\n\nThe aspects that can be implemented are done to skirt around contentious issues. For example, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has been transformed into a company from July 1 with a mandate to become commercial but it will continue to pay petrol subsidy with 100 percent of its revenue after paying salaries.\n\nThe Buhari government\u2019s inability to rein in crude theft is the biggest turn-off for investors. Using a back-of-the-envelope estimate, Sangster, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria boss, said the country could be losing about $10 million daily in accrued revenue with an estimated loss of 100,00 per barrels a day at the cost of $100 a barrel.\n\n\u201cI think, frankly, it\u2019s organised crime,\u201d said Sangster.\n\nRead also: Delay in implementing PIA 2021 continues to impede consistent fuel supply\n\nAnalysts at Wood Mackenzie, in a report earlier in the year, revealed that Shell\u2019s Bonny and the Brass oil pipeline system, owned by the upstream joint venture between Eni, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company and Oando, were facing systemic attacks.\n\n\u201cThe scale and sophistication of crude thefts suggest an organised operation on an industrial scale,\u201d said analysts at Wood Mackenzie.\n\nThe report said theft and vandalism hit Shell\u2019s Bonny pipeline system the hardest, leading to the declaration of force majeure at the Bonny terminal in March 2022 due to a drop in crude output.\n\nHeirs Oil & Gas averaged losses of 66 percent from Oil Mining Licence (OML) 17 in 2021, peaking at 97 percent in December.\n\nSimilarly, Eni\u2019s Brass oil pipeline in the northern Niger Delta was heavily impacted, with local security contractors scrambling to deal with an unprecedented number of incidents early in the year.\n\nDue to pipeline sabotage, Eni declared force majeure at the Brass River oil terminal in March, though the sabotage is concentrated at the Obiafu-Obrikom and Ebocha facilities.\n\nSangster said TotalEnergies had declared a force majeure on its OML 58 and had stopped production on February 24 due to the vandalism of its oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nMilitary operations started to curb the menace and have proven ineffective, with accusations of compromised security personnel. Host communities, reports say, are also involved in sabotaging oil and gas infrastructure to seek compensation.\n\nThe organisers may have billed the event to be a discussion on the way forward for the beleaguered sector but it ended up sounding like a three-day lamentation where even those appointed or elected to solve the problem appeared to wail louder than operators.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe achievements of the internationally acclaimed Nigerian biker, Mr Kunle Adeyanju has made Nigerians proud and the country is much popular on account of his feat, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this Thursday when he received the biker who rode a motorbike from London to Lagos recently promoting the \u201cEnd Polio\u201d campaign, at his official residence, Aguda House, Presidential Villa.\n\nAdeyanju was accompanied by other bikers drawn from across the country and his delegation also included Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman/CEO, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) and District Governor of Rotary Club District 9125, Mr Goddy Nnadi among other officials.\n\nAdeyanju shared his travel experience during the visit to the VP, while speaking later, the Vice President said his stories are those \u201cwe must tell and retell. They are stories of our successes and we must continue to tell those stories and telling it in the light that will shame those who continue to tell stories that Africa is all about people who are killing each other and all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you not have acts of terrorism these days, but the truth of the matter is that vast majority of our people are good people, generous people, hospitable people, as you found,\u201d referring to the Diaspora Biker.\n\nThe VP then said \u201cyour achievements have made us all proud, we are all standing much taller on account of what you have done. And I know that this is just the beginning of the many more ways by which you will promote Nigeria and Africa.\u201d\n\nSpeaking specifically about Nigeria, the VP noted that \u201cthere is a lot in our country that we must be extremely proud of. We must tell our own story just as Kunle has said. Our story is worth hearing and we must tell our story first to ourselves because we need to get our self-esteem back as a people.\n\n\u201cWe must tell our stories to ourselves and we must understand who we are and what our strengths are. We are resilient, strong, innovative, and creative. In this country, just in about 5 to 6 years, 7 tech companies have become Unicorns (i.e. companies worth over a billion dollars), in this same country and all started by young Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCommending the Bikers\u2019 community in the country, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cthe work that you are doing all over the country, promoting unity is important. The truth of the matter about unity is that the average Nigerian does not ask questions about where you come from, Nigerians are united wherever you find them.\n\n\u201cGo to the markets, go anywhere, you find that Nigerians relate to each other as Nigerians. I have been all over this country, those who promote ethnicity, promote religious superiority are people who want to advance their personal interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that those of you who have a message of unity to preach must continue to do so. This country is strong and this country is the way it is only because of the very many parts that we are, we are 200 million strong from everywhere. And all of us have capacity and all of us have everything that it takes to excel,\u201d the Vice President added.\n\nAddressing the Bikers\u2019 community drawn from across the country who came to the villa with Adeyanju, the VP noted that \u201cwe must stay together, we must stay united and I think that anybody that has seen how you have come from different parts of the country to celebrate Kunle Adeyanju, all of you have together, demonstrated the essence of who we are as Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are a proud people, we are people who believe in excellence, we celebrate excellence, we want to excel in everywhere, and everywhere we are, we excel.\u201d\n\nOn efforts to maintain Nigeria\u2019s polio status, the Vice President said the Federal Government working with the States under the auspices of the National Economic Council will remain vigilant and not loss focus on the issue.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhat we have done at the National Economic Council which is a meeting of the Governors of the 36 States Governors which I have the privilege of chairing every month, is that we have made it one of the very central public health issues which means that every year, sometimes twice a year, we have a committee which deals with polio alone with the World Health Organisation and several other organizations, including local organizations which come and give a report of the status of the drive against polio in the country. It keeps us well informed.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Mr Adeyanju spoke about his 12,000 kilometers adventure turned charity ride from London to Lagos, explaining his focus and experience.\n\nAdeyanju said he flew Nigeria\u2019s flag proudly and found out that the story of Africa, including Nigeria, has not been correctly told in the international media, hence his decision to write a book about his experience riding from Europe to Africa.\n\nHe explained that his lifted fist signature while on the journey was copied from the Vice President indicative of Africa\u2019s resilience and strength even in the face of adversity.\n\nAnother highpoint of the visit was the presentation of the bikers\u2019 regalia to the Vice President and some of the symbolic exercises demonstrated by the bikers.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

This is evident from the feeders from our foot soldiers and members, signifying strongly that the ongoing INEC registration exercise in the country is not being pursued vigorously in the district.\n\n\u201cThe statistical distribution across the six local government areas of the district reveals that the data from the district is deplorably disproportionate relative to other districts in the state. Our findings reveal that there are not enough registration centres, INEC registration machines and personnel available in the district, thereby limiting access for potential voters to register.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis scenario portends both disenfranchisement of Edo North voters willing to vote in the 2023 general elections and undermining their electoral rights. The leadership and members of NOCSON as well as other stakeholders are by this press conference calling on the Chairman of INEC and particularly the Resident Electoral Commissioner of Edo State to, as a matter of urgency, activate the process of registering more eligible voters,\u201d he charged.\n\nThe group called for increase in the number of registration centres across the six LGAs in the district, including Etsako East, Etsako West, Etsako Central, Owan West, Owan East and Akoko Edo LGAs; provision of more data capturing machines to cover the six LGAs and deployment of enough personnel to man the eventual machines to be deployed to the various centres.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He also noted that the report was an attack on his reputation and livelihood, stressing that he would take legal action against Hundeyin over the alleged \u2018libellous publication\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe attack on my reputation and livelihood by a purveyor of yellow journalism pursuing a mission of personal vendetta is surprising and regrettable but not unexpected.

          "text": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter and France footballing legend Michel Platini were both cleared of corruption charges by a Swiss court on Friday.\n\nBlatter, who led FIFA for 17 years, was cleared of fraud by the Federal Criminal Court in the southern city of Bellinzona.\n\nPlatini, a former France national team captain and manager, was also acquitted of fraud.\n\nThe two, once among the most powerful figures in global soccer, had denied the charges against them.\n\nThose charges were placed against their name in November following an investigation launched by prosecutors in 2015 into a payment of two million Swiss francs (\u00a31.6m) arranged by Blatter to be paid to Platini by FIFA in February 2011.\n\nThe case saw Blatter forced to end his 17-year reign as FIFA president in 2015 and dashed hopes of former France midfielder Platini of succeeding him. Platini was forced to quit UEFA in 2016.\n\nSpeaking outside the Swiss Federal Criminal Court on Friday morning, Blatter said: \u2018I am not innocent in my life but in this case I am innocent!\u2019, and he and Platini have now been acquitted.\n\nAfter the verdict was delivered, Platini said he will be going after \u2018culprits\u2019 that led to the case being put against him.\n\n\u2018In this case, there are culprits who did not appear during this trial,\u2019 the 1984 Euros winner said.\n\n\u201cLet them count on me, we will meet again. Because I will not give up and I will go all the way in my quest for truth.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Blatter said: \u2018I am not speaking about FIFA, I am not speaking about corruption, I am speaking about me.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s it, I have done nothing wrong. I am clean with my conscious, I am clean with my spirit, and I am clean with my anima (soul).\u2019\n\nAsked about his relationship with Platini, Blatter added: \u2018It is a good relationship, we have been separated for years, but we are still good friends.\u2019\n\nBlatter, 86, had said the two-million franc payment followed a \u2018gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2019 between the pair when he asked Platini to be his technical advisor in 1998.\n\nPlatini, 67, worked as a consultant between 1998 and 2002 with an annual salary of 300,000 Swiss francs \u2013 the most FIFA could afford because of money troubles the organisation had at the time, Blatter has told the court.\n\nThe rest of Platini\u2019s one million per year salary was to be settled at a later date, Blatter said.\n\nMotives for the payment were unclear, although the two men met in 2010 and discussed the upcoming elections for the FIFA presidency in 2011.\n\nWhen Blatter approved the payment, he was campaigning for re-election against Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar. Platini, then president of UEFA, was seen as having sway with European members who could influence the vote.\n\nThe payment emerged following a huge investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice into bribery, fraud and money-laundering at FIFA in 2015, which triggered Blatter\u2019s resignation.\n\nBlatter and Platini claim they had a verbal deal in 1998 for the Frenchman to be paid one million Swiss francs (\u00a3818,000) to serve as advisor to Blatter, should he be elected as FIFA president.\n\nThat defence first failed with judges at the FIFA ethics committee, and later in separate appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee investigations banned them from football for eight years, reduced to six on appeal.\n\nPlatini, who also lost his job as UEFA president following the ban, said the affair was a deliberate attempt to thwart his attempt to become FIFA president in 2015.\n\nPlatini\u2019s former general secretary at UEFA, Gianni Infantino, entered the FIFA race and won the election in 2016.\n\nPlatini signed a contract with FIFA in August 1999 for 300,000 Swiss francs (\u00a3245,000) annually and backdated to January.\n\nThis was just one of 25 investigations by the Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) into corruption in football, with some 12 still pending.\n\nThe United States\u2019 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has also investigated corruption in the game.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

The minister then directed that the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) urgently works with other security agencies to fortify all correctional centres in the country and insulate them against future attacks, among other measures introduced.\n\n\u201cThis was carried out as well-armed soldiers, police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers were drafted to our facilities nationwide, to secure them against further attacks. Several but unsuccessful attempts were made to attack our facilities since then, as the armed guards repelled them on each occasion.\u201d\n\nAregbesola, who said he had been briefed on the invasion of the correctional facility in Kuje, stated that the security officers on duty fiercely engaged the attackers and inflicted a heavy casualty on them.\n\nHe confirmed that the security operatives were overpowered by the invaders, adding that one of them was killed while calm and normalcy have since been returned to the centre.\n\n\u2018Calm But Vigilant\u2019\n\nPreliminary investigation, according to the minister, indicates that the Boko Haram terrorists may have been responsible for the attack as the NCoS, in conjunction with other security agencies, work to bring back in the escaped inmates.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the National Security Adviser, as well as other intelligence and security agencies to ensure that the attackers and the escaped inmates are captured and returned to custody,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, security personnel are combing the whole area, up to a distance of 100 kilometres radius, looking for them. All checkpoints nationwide have been put on alert. More than 400 of them have been brought in and more are still coming. We appeal to all residents to be calm but vigilant.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a collective work between government and the citizens. Kindly, therefore, report all suspicious individuals and activities to the nearest security agency around you. We appeal also to doctors and medical workers to treat and then immediately report anyone with gunshot wounds to the law enforcement agency.\u201d\n\nThe minister has also directed that all correctional facilities in the country be fortified and that all personnel be vigilant and alert to avoid a recurrence.\n\nHe asked that a full investigation into the incident be carried out and be briefed as soon as possible, stressing that appropriate actions would be taken should any complicity be established.\n\nAregbesola pledged to continue to strengthen all correctional facilities and keep Nigerians safe at all times.",

          "text": "Japan\u2019s former prime minister Shinzo Abe died in hospital on Friday, local media reported, hours after being shot at a political campaign event in an attack condemned as \u201cabsolutely unforgivable\u201d.\n\nCiting a senior member of Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party, national broadcaster NHK said \u201cformer prime minister Abe died at a hospital in Kashihara city, Nara, where he was receiving medical treatment. He was 67.\u201d\n\nThe death was also reported by other broadcasters as well as the Japanese news agencies Jiji and Kyodo.\n\nThe assassination of the country\u2019s best-known politician comes despite Japan\u2019s strict gun laws and with campaigning underway ahead of upper house elections on Sunday.\n\nEarlier Prime Minister Fumio Kishida abandoned the campaign trail and flew to Tokyo by helicopter where he addressed reporters in a voice that wavered with emotion.\n\n\u201cFormer prime minister Shinzo Abe was shot in Nara and I have been informed he is in a very grave condition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI pray that former prime minister Abe will survive,\u201d he added, condemning \u201ca barbaric act during election campaigning, which is the foundation of democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely unforgivable. I condemn this act in the strongest terms.\u201d\n\nThe attack came before noon in the country\u2019s western region of Nara, where Abe, 67, had been delivering a stump speech with security present, but spectators able to approach him easily.\n\nFootage broadcast by NHK showed him standing on a stage when a man dressed in a grey shirt and brown trousers begins approaching from behind, before drawing something from a bag and firing.\n\nAt least two shots appear to be fired, each producing a cloud of smoke.\n\nAs spectators and reporters ducked, a man was shown being tackled to the ground by security. He was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, reports said.\n\nLocal media identified the man as 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami, citing police sources, with several media outlets describing him as a former member of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, the country\u2019s navy.\n\nHe was wielding a weapon described by local media as a \u201chandmade gun\u201d, and NHK said he told police after his arrest that he \u201ctargeted Abe with the intention of killing him\u201d.\n\n\u2018A Large Bang\u2019\n\nWitnesses at the scene described shock as the political event turned into chaos.\n\n\u201cThe first shot sounded like a toy bazooka,\u201d a woman told NHK.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t fall and there was a large bang. The second shot was more visible, you could see the spark and smoke,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cAfter the second shot, people surrounded him and gave him cardiac massage.\u201d\n\nAbe was bleeding from the neck, witnesses said and photographs showed. He was reportedly initially responsive but subsequently lost consciousness.\n\nOfficials from the local chapter of Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party said there had been no threats before the incident and that his speech had been announced publicly.\n\nKishida said \u201cno decision\u201d had been made on the election, though several parties announced their senior members would halt campaigning in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe attack prompted international shock.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very sad moment,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a G20 meeting in Bali, saying the United States was \u201cdeeply saddened and deeply concerned\u201d.\n\nThailand\u2019s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha was \u201cvery shocked\u201d at Abe\u2019s shooting, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d by the news.\n\n\u2018Profoundly Sad And Shocking\u2019\n\nAbe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, held office in 2006 for one year and again from 2012 to 2020 when he was forced to step down due to the debilitating bowel condition ulcerative colitis.\n\nHe is a hawkish conservative who pushed for the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution to recognise the country\u2019s military and has stayed a prominent political figure even after his resignation.\n\nJapan has some of the world\u2019s toughest gun-control laws, and annual deaths from firearms in the country of 125 million people are regularly in single figures.\n\nGetting a gun licence is a long and complicated process for Japanese citizens, who must first get a recommendation from a shooting association and then undergo strict police checks.\n\nJapan has seen \u201cnothing like this for well over 50 to 60 years\u201d, Corey Wallace, an assistant professor at Kanagawa University who focuses on Japanese politics, told AFP.\n\nHe said the last similar incident was likely the 1960 assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, the leader of the Japan Socialist Party, who was stabbed by a right-wing youth.\n\n\u201cBut two days before an election, of a (man) who is so prominent\u2026 it\u2019s really profoundly sad and shocking.\u201d\n\nHe noted, too, that Japanese politicians and voters are used to a personal and close-up style of campaigning.\n\n\u201cThis could really change.\u201d",

Platini, then president of UEFA, was seen as having sway with European members who could influence the vote.\n\nThe payment emerged following a huge investigation launched by the US Department of Justice into bribery, fraud and money-laundering at FIFA in 2015, which triggered Blatter\u2019s resignation.\n\nBoth officials were banned from football for eight years in 2015 over the payment, although their bans were later reduced.\n\nPlatini, who also lost his job as UEFA president following the ban, said the affair was a deliberate attempt to thwart his attempt to become FIFA president in 2015.\n\nPlatini\u2019s former general secretary at UEFA, Gianni Infantino, entered the FIFA race and won the election in 2016.\n\nSpeaking following the verdict, Platini said: \u201cI want to express my happiness for all my loved ones that justice has finally been done after seven years of lies and manipulation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMy fight is a fight against injustice. I won a first game.\n\n\u201cIn this case, there are culprits who did not appear during this trial. Let them count on me, we will meet again. Because I will not give up and I will go all the way in my quest for truth.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, going from being a legend of world soccer to a devil is very difficult, especially when it comes to you in a totally unfair way.\u201d\n\nSky Sports",

A puff of smoke behind Abe could be seen in a separate video shown in NHK.\n\nTBS Television reported that Abe had been shot on the left side of his chest and apparently also in the neck.\n\nPolitical violence is rare in Japan, a country with strict gun regulations.\n\nAbe served two terms as prime minister to become Japan\u2019s longest-serving premier before stepping down in 2020 citing ill health.\n\nBut he has remained a dominant presence over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), controlling one of its major factions.\n\nHis protege, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, goes into Sunday\u2019s upper house election hoping, analysts say, to emerge from Abe\u2019s shadow and define his premiership.\n\nKishida suspended his election campaign after Abe\u2019s shooting and was returning to Tokyo, media reported.\n\nThe government said there was no plan to postpone the election.\n\nThe ambassador of the United States, Rahm Emanuel, said he was saddened and shocked by the shooting of an outstanding leader and unwavering ally.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government and American people are praying for the well-being of Abe-san, his family, and the people of Japan,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAbe is best known for his signature \u201cAbenomics\u201d policy featured bold monetary easing and fiscal spending. read more\n\nHe also bolstered defence spending after years of declines and expanded the military\u2019s ability to project power abroad.\n\nIn a historic shift in 2014, his government reinterpreted the postwar, pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two.\n\nThe following year, legislation ended a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or defending a friendly country under attack.\n\nAbe, however, did not achieve his long-held goal of revising the U.S.-drafted constitution by writing the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan\u2019s military in known, into the pacifist Article 9.\n\nHe was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games, which were postponed by a year to 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAbe first took office in 2006 as Japan\u2019s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.\n\nHe became prime minister again in 2012.\n\nAbe hails from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a grandfather who served as premier.\n\nFirst elected to parliament in 1993 after his father\u2019s death, Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago.\n\nThough Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo\u2019s Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan\u2019s past militarism.\n\nIn later years, Abe refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings.",

          "text": "Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from Wimbledon ahead of Friday\u2019s semifinal match against Nick Kyrgios with a torn abdominal muscle.\n\nThe 22-time major champion said that he had been experiencing pain in the area for the past week but that the injury got worse during Wednesday\u2019s quarterfinal match against Taylor Fritz, specifically while serving.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as you can imagine if I am here, I have to pull out from the tournament,\u201d Nadal told a room of reporters Thursday. \u201cAs everybody saw yesterday, I have been suffering with the pain in abdominal. I know something was not OK there, as I said yesterday.\u201d\n\nKyrgios, who had reached the semifinals at a Grand Slam for the first time with his win over Cristian Garin on Wednesday, will now face either top-seeded Novak Djokovic or No. 9 Cameron Norrie in Sunday\u2019s championship match.\n\nNadal practiced for around 45 minutes on Thursday, spending most of the time hitting forehands and backhands, and though he did practice some serves, they were at a vastly reduced speed. Spanish newspaper Marca reported Thursday that Nadal has a 7-millimeter tear in one of his abdominal muscles but that he intended to play.\n\nUltimately he said it came down to not believing he would be able to play his best with the injury.\n\n\u201cI made my decision because I believe that I can\u2019t win two matches under these circumstances,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI can\u2019t serve. [It\u2019s] not only that I can\u2019t serve at the right speed, it\u2019s that I can\u2019t do the normal movement to serve.\n\n\u201cI have to say that, imagine myself winning two matches, and for respect to myself in some way, I don\u2019t want to go out there, not be competitive enough to play at the level that I need to play to achieve my goal, and with a big chance to make the things much worse, no?\u201d\n\nNadal wore tape over part of his abdomen and required treatment, including painkillers, during his five-set victory over Fritz.\n\nNadal, 36, was trying to win Wimbledon for the third time and the first time since 2010. He was playing in the tournament for the first time since 2019.\n\nHaving won the Australian Open and the French Open earlier this year, Nadal was vying at Wimbledon to continue his quest for a calendar Grand Slam and to take home his 23rd major title, which would have tied him with Serena Williams for the most by a player in the Open era.\n\nNadal said he didn\u2019t regret finishing the match Wednesday, despite the wishes of his father and sister, seated in his player box, who were urging him to retire.\n\n\u201c[It] was the right decision because I finished the match,\u201d he said. \u201cI won the match. I did the things that I felt in every single moment. I am not the kind of player and the kind of person that, when you make decisions, [is] going to look back and say, I should not [have] done that, or I should do another thing.\n\n\u201c[On] the other hand, I didn\u2019t want to pull out, to go out the court in the middle of a quarterfinals match. Even if, as I say yesterday, the chance of retirement stays in my mind for a long time after the first five, six games, I find a way to finish the match. Something that I am proud of. Then you confirm that you have an injury, then you make the decision thinking about your health and your future.\u201d\n\nNadal said he expects it will take three to four weeks to recover from the injury.\n\nThe last man in the Open Era to withdraw before a major semifinal singles match was Richard Krajicek at the 1992 Australian Open.",

          "text": "Dr. Ahmad Lawan, President of Nigeria\u2019s Senate, on Thursday said Tuesday\u2019s attack on the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre was successful, because it was done in connivance with insiders at the facility.\n\nImportantly, he said the incident spoke volumes about the failure of the country\u2019s security architecture.\n\nBut the federal government, has said it has mobilised all the nation\u2019s security apparatuses to go after the attackers and fleeing escapees, ordering immediate activation of checkpoints across the country in search of them.\n\nLawan spoke, when he led a delegation of the senate leadership to assess the level of destruction done to the correctional facility by insurgents. The senators were conducted round the facility by the Comptroller-General of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa.\n\nAccording to the senate president, an attack on the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre, could only have been possible with the collaboration of insiders within the nation\u2019s correctional system.\n\nHe faulted the Nigerian Correctional Service for not providing Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) at the Kuje correctional facility and others across the country.\n\nLawan, therefore, asked the Comptroller General of the NCS to include a request for the provision of CCTV across maximum and medium correctional centers across the country in its 2023 budget proposal to the National Assembly for approval.\n\n\u201cThe attack on this correctional facility is symptomatic of the failure of security failure. The attack is only a culmination of the failure. We were told that an estimated 300 terrorists attacked this facility. They came on foot, and I believe they should have been detected.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, 300 people will not come for an operation like this without planning. Planning must have taken a week, a month or a bit more. I believe that our security agencies should have picked this from their tracking systems in the FCT.\n\n\u201cSecondly, having gone round the facility itself, we are disappointed that this facility does not have Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras, something that would record and give you details of what is happening and sometimes record the events.\n\n\u201cThis is a medium security custodial center, how on earth in the FCT facility of this magnitude we don\u2019t have CCTV? It means we can say that all other medium security centers across the country do not have CCTV.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the Comptroller General of Correctional Centre to ensure that the request for CCTV at the maximum and medium custodial centres of the country are included in their 2023 budget, because this is essential and indispensable.\n\n\u201cNow, as this facility lacks a functional CCTV, there\u2019s no record of what happened, except narration. But if we had CCTV, at least the records would have been there and analysis made, and arrest will be based on the information from the CCTV.\n\n\u201cThirdly, going from one cell to another to release people, specifically, those that are known to be insurgents, tells a lot of story. It may not be far away from an insider job, someone, who is either working in this place or must have worked here. I think we have to look deeper into what happened, so that we find the culprits, because when things like this happen, then there should be sanctions.\n\n\u201cWhere people fail to do their job properly, and they have been given that responsibility, they should be asked to take responsibility. If people don\u2019t take responsibility for their failure, then it means nobody would bother to do what is expected of their office or the job that the person has been given.\n\n\u201cHaving this kind of situation today in the FCT, that we have criminals, who are free now all over the city is very dangerous and you can never have peace of mind. The FCT has the seat of government, and today that seat is not safe. So, we have to do whatever it takes to get everybody back.\u201d\n\nLawan tasked the security agencies to ensure that the insurgents, who escaped from the Kuje medium security custodial center are found and brought back.\n\nCommanding Officer of the Nigerian Army Battalion in Gwagwalada, Lieutenant Colonel Adisa, had told the Senate leadership that, over three hundred insurgents were behind Tuesday\u2019s attack on the Kuje medium security custodial facility.\n\nHe added that, a total of 50 security personnel were on ground, when the terrorists armed with IEDs stormed the facility to release the insurgents.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, who claimed the federal government had mobilised against the attackers, said, \u201cWe are working with the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the National Security Adviser as well as other intelligence and security agencies to ensure that the attackers and the escaped inmates are captured and returned to custody.\u201d\n\nAregbesola, in a statement by his media aide, Sola Fasure, added: \u201cAs we speak, security personnel are combing the whole area, up to a distance of 100 kilometres radius, looking for them. All checkpoints nationwide, have been put on alert. More than 400 of them have been brought in and more are still coming.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that he had been briefed on the full scale armed invasion of the correctional facility.\n\nHe recalled that the security officers on duty fiercely engaged the criminals and inflicted a heavy casualty on them, but regrettably, given their unprecedented number, they overpowered the officers on duty. One of the security personnel that engaged the attackers was unfortunately killed.\n\nThe minister noted that preliminary investigation, has indicated that the Boko Haram sect might have been responsible for the attack, adding that the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), in conjunction with other security agencies, were working to bring back in the escaped inmates.\n\nHe said after the Abolongo, Oyo State, attack on a correctional facility, in October last year, it became apparent that a new form of attack for which the system was not prepared had emerged.\n\n\u201cOur system was primed to prevent and foil internal disturbance and riots, not external attacks/invasion, since the facilities were usually built around police and military formations,\u201d he explained, directing also that the NCoS urgently work with other security agencies to fortify all correctional centres in the country and insulate them against future attacks, among other measures introduced.\n\nHe said this was carried out, as well armed soldiers, police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers were drafted to their facilities nationwide, to secure them against further attacks, saying, \u201cSeveral but unsuccessful attempts were made to attack our facilities since then, as the armed guards repelled them on each occasion.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all residents to be calm but vigilant. Security is a collective work between government and the citizens. Kindly, therefore, report all suspicious individuals and activities to the nearest security agency around you. We appeal also to doctors and medical workers to treat and then immediately report anyone with gunshot wounds to the law enforcement agency.\u201d\n\nThe government, according to the minister, has further directed that all correctional facilities in the country be fortified; that all personnel be vigilant and alert, to avoid recurrence.\n\nConsequently, he has directed full investigation into the incident and that he should be briefed as soon as possible, adding that, if any complicity was established, appropriate actions would be taken.\n\nSunday Aborisade and Michael Olugbode in Abuja",
