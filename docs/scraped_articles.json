          "title": "Ohanaeze, northern group disagree over N100m bounty on Kanu",
          "text": "Publicity Secretary of Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze, Alex Ogboannaya, has slammed a coalition of Northern groups for placing a bounty on the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that a coalition of 75 northern groups under the aegis of Northern Consensus Movement on Thursday, placed a bounty of N100 for anybody who could provide information on Kanu\u2019s whereabouts and aid his \u2018capture\u2019 by law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe NCM specifically accused Kanu and IPOB militant wing, Eastern Security Network, of masterminding the recent spate of attacks on northern communities in the South-East.\n\nThe move by the NCM came one week after the Igbo Elders Council alleged that more than 5,000 Igbo youths had been killed and over 10,000 others thrown into detention camps in the ongoing special security operation in the South-East.\n\nThe spokesperson for NCM, Dr Awwal Abdullahi Aliyu, during the press briefing, urged the United States, United Kingdom and European Union to facilitate Kanu\u2019s repatriation to Nigeria to face treasonable charges against him.\n\nSpeaking with Saturday PUNCH in an exclusive interview, Ogbonnaya, said, \u201cI congratulate the Northern Coalition Movement for thinking about Nigeria, but if they want to be fair, they should place N100m bounty on the heads of leaders of Boko Haram, Fulani Herdsmen, ISWAP, and other non-state actors, who are known to be terrorists. As you know, Ohanaeze does not agree that the Indigenous People of Biafra is a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu is not the issue here. There is a major issue of selective justice when you focus on one and leave another.\n\n\u201cIgbos all over have been complaining of injustice. No matter the millions of dollars placed on Nnamdi Kanu, it cannot stop agitation from the South-East.\u201d\n\nHe blamed the issue of agitations on the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nAccording to him, when all the appointments are being manned by one section, then, that is not showing federal character.\n\n\u201cWhat the region needs are justice and peaceful dialogue with the Federal Government. If this is done, all these issues of agitations and secession coming from the region will cease.\n\n\u201cOur advice to the NCM is to direct their agitations to the appropriate authorities,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso reacting, Senator Sani, who represented Kaduna Central at the 8th National Assembly, faulted the move by the NCM, stating that the group should have channelled their efforts towards ending the terrorism and banditry currently ravaging their region.\n\nThe former lawmaker made the remark on Friday in a post on his official Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe have terrorists and bandits here up North, killing and kidnapping our people; why don\u2019t the northern groups place a price tag on the heads of their leaders instead of placing them on someone far abroad?\u201d he asked.\n\nSimilarly, Ifedayo Adedipe, SAN, while speaking to our correspondent on the issue, stated, \u201cIs the Northern Consensus Movement synonymous with the whole of Nigeria? Or has it been proved that Nnamdi Kanu attacked any of them?\n\n\u201cI personally think that placing a bounty of N100m on Kanu\u2019s head is a form of misconduct on their part. In fact, it is arrogant and provocative. Kanu has only expressed his dislike for Nigeria\u2019s current federal arrangement.\n\n\u201cI believe that it is the duty of the Federal Government to prosecute whoever has been accused of committing an offence of that magnitude. This so-called coalition lacks the right to place a bounty on anybody. No group has the right to do this, only the Federal Government; and it has to be through the proper channels.\n\n\u201cIf I can recall, there was a time when a number of these Northern groups gave the Igbos an ultimatum to leave the North. The members of these groups are miscreants and their actions are provocative. I maintain that placing a bounty of N100m on Kanu\u2019s head is unlawful.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Why Buhari cut off military supplies to Man O\u2019 War clubs in 1981 \u2013Don",
          "text": "Professor of Water Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ifeolu Adewumi, has narrated how General Muhammadu Buhari, who was the General Officer Commanding, 2nd Mechanised Division at the Command\u2019s Office in Agodi, Ibadan, Oyo State, cut off military supplies to voluntary paramilitary organisation, Man O\u2019 War Club in 1981.\n\nThe 69-year-old academic and former President of National Union of voluntary paramilitary organisation, Man O\u2019 War Clubs in Higher Institutions of Nigeria, stated this in an exclusive interview with Saturday PUNCH.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs members of the Man O\u2019 War Club, we did community service in those days. That was the main objective and not to run after politicians or guard any big man as it is today. We looked for what to do in communities and we assisted in terms of security. Also, if there were no latrine, we built it; if there were no footbridges, we provided it. Our duties were purely about serving the community.\n\n\u201cUsually, soldiers from the Nigerian Army came to train us. They also took care of our camping materials, food, uniform and others. I recollect meeting General Buhari. That was in May 1981. I went there as the Commander-in-Chief of Man O\u2019 War club in UNIFE.\n\n\u201cI went there with other officers in the Man O\u2019 War. When we got there and filled the form to say that the commander-in-chief of Man O\u2019 War was there to see him, we waited for about 20 minutes and when he (Buhari) came out, he said, \u2018I was told that there is a C-in-C in the Office of a GOC, I think it should be the other way round.\u2019 Buhari is a very humorous person. I got the joke and I saluted him and got up. And he said, \u2018Now that we know who is in control, you can come into my office.\u2019\n\n\u201cI went in and introduced everybody and requested logistics support for Man O\u2019 War. The next thing General Buhari asked was that. \u2018How many northerners are in your university?\u2019 I said, \u2018Sir, University of Ife is a regional institution in the Western Region, there will be more people from here than from other tribes. In ABU (Ahmadu Bello University), there will be more northerners than other tribes and in (University of Nigeria) Nsukka, there will be more Igbo there.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Okay, okay, how many of you have joined the Army?\u2019 I mentioned a few people. He then asked how we managed (to get) our uniforms and I told him. He studied us and said, \u2018I am writing my handover notes. By the time you come in two weeks\u2019 time, you will meet the person in charge, he will tell you our decision\u2019.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks later, we went back and we met General Joshua Hananiah. He is late now. After retirement, he was appointed the Corp Marshal for the Federal Road Safety Corps. Then, he said, \u2018I have bad news for you. By the next time you come, we must not see you in Army uniform. If we see you in Army uniform, we will treat you as impersonators and you know what that means\u2019.\n\n\u201cI tried to raise an objection but Hananiah said, \u2018Don\u2019t you know when a senior officer has given an instruction, you don\u2019t go against it? That is an order\u2019. As the Commander-in-Chief for all Man O\u2019 War clubs in Nigeria, I told the other commanders to come over to Ife and told them not to use the Army green uniform anymore for our safety and that was why we changed the Man O\u2019 War uniform to brown khaki that you see today. That was how the military cut off supplies to Man O\u2019 War Clubs.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Sometime around noon in April 2021, Salisu retreated under the shade of a mango tree to escape the scorching rays of the Sokoto sun. From a distance, he looked tired, worn. Closer, he looked starved, and his eyes nestled in their sockets, emitting a glow like dying embers.\n\nSalisu does not know his age but his prepubescent frame detailed it between six and seven years old. The native of Zabarmawa has vague memory of home but he remembers how his parents dumped him in an Almajiri school. He is only opportune to go home during the Sallah festival.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are between 100 and 150 in the Almajiri school. And we recite the Quran every morning,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cthe Mallam doesn\u2019t cook for us. My parents bring food, garri for me, at least every week, in a sack. We usually give it to Mallam. Sometimes, they will bring it together with pure water. I only go home during Sallah.\u201d\n\nLike Salisu, Adamu looked hungry. Light complexioned with a piercing look, the 13-year-old claimed his father is a farmer and his mother, a trader. He said he was dumped in the Almajiri system at age 10.\n\nThe native of Tuluwa, in Sokoto, claimed that he and his colleagues rely on begging to survive because their Mallam hardly gives them food. When they are not out begging, they fetch water for use by their Mallam\u2019s household.\n\n\u201cDuring the rainy season, we used to go to our Mallam\u2019s farm. Sometimes, the rule is that if you don\u2019t go to the farm, you won\u2019t be given food.\u201d\n\nLike Salisu, Abban looked hungry at first glance. Although he was much older and looked like he was in his early 20s, he persistently complained of hunger. This sounded odd given his age and the season: it was the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan and his lamentation elicited questions concerning his observance of the fast.\n\nIn response, he said he wasn\u2019t fasting because he hadn\u2019t taken predawn meal (sahur).\n\nAbban disclosed that there are about 200 boys under the tutelage of his Mallam, including him, and they survive on handouts: the clothes they wear, food they eat are donations from private individuals and NGOs.\n\nAccording to Abban, the more you give your Mallam, be it food or cash earned on your begging tours, the more love you earn from him. When asked why he is not going to school despite free education, he said, \u201cMy father didn\u2019t put me there.\u201d\n\nHe, however, disclosed that after leaving Almajiri school, he intends to start a business and get married, or become a soldier or a security guard.\n\nUntil then, Abban, like fellow Almajirai will continue to loiter public places including filling stations, shopping malls, motor-parks, and cinemas with his bowl, to beg for left over food and loose money.\n\nThe law on a child\u2019s rights\n\nUnder the Islamic law, child maintenance is the ultimate right of a child thus parents are responsible for providing maintenance to children and providing them with appropriate (formal and Islamic) education. Moreover, the Child\u2019s Right Act (2003) is the law that guarantees the rights of all children in Nigeria; it is an Act that provides and seeks to protect the rights of a Nigerian child\u2014 and other related matters. However, currently, 11 states, all in northern Nigeria, are yet to domesticate the Child\u2019s Rights Act. These children, especially Almajiri children are bearing the brunt of this inaction.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), last year, released the \u201c2019 Poverty and Inequality in Nigeria\u201d report, which highlights that 40 percent of the total population, or almost 83 million people, live below the country\u2019s poverty line of N137,430 per year.\n\nMore so, fewer than half of the children in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria attend \u201covercrowded government primary schools, official data from 2015 shows.\n\nAlmajiri schools help fill the gap and parents pay as little as N500 ($1.30) a month in fees.\u201d\n\nIssues revolving around the practice of Almajiri include child destitution, child trafficking and alms seeking.\n\nMeeting Mallam Muhammad of \u201cMakaranta Muhammadiya\u201d\n\nMallam Muhammad is the owner of one of Almajiri schools in Sokoto, named Makaranta Muhammadiya. \u201cI believe God will give me reward for what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said, adding that he doesn\u2019t know the number of boys in his school. \u201cTheir parents used to come to check on them sometimes. After they finish and leave here, they would go and start business. They can only leave here if only God wishes; God is their timer,\u201d said Muhammad.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI have a farm but I\u2019m not eating it with them. They will come with their own foodstuff. Government doesn\u2019t bring food, except God. Even if you come (join us), God will give you food.\u201d\n\nMuhammad stated that the government does not have a stake in the Almajiri system, stressing that it is an age-long practice that has stood the test of time.\n\nAlmajiri System: A Faded Legacy\n\nThe Almajiri system of education, which dates back to the 11th century, is an Islamic school system with a long history in northern Nigeria. Under the Sokoto Caliphate, the Almajiri regime was solidified by the Islamic revolt of the 18th century. This educational system focuses on Quranic and Islamic education, with students learning a trade for a living, too. Schools were governed under the Sokoto Caliphate, and teachers reported directly to the Emir of their province.\n\nTeachers, parents, officials, and the community as a whole raised the schools\u2019 students. Students will farm and carry food to the school to complement the Almajiri scheme. It was a course in the region\u2019s society and culture, similar to Western education, where students were taught the Islamic and northern Nigerian way of life.\n\nNow, most of these children are lacking access to formal education. According to a UNICEF study in 2014, Nigeria has 9.5 million Almajiri children, accounting for 72 percent of the country\u2019s out-of-school children. Estimates in 2019 revealed that Nigeria has between 13.2 million and 15 million out-of-school children, the majority of whom are in northern Nigeria.\n\nOn the UNICEF website, it is estimated that \u201cIn north-eastern and north-western states, 29 percent and 35 percent of Muslim children, respectively, receive Qur\u2019anic education, which does not include basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. The government considers children attending such schools to be officially out-of-school.\u201d\n\nNowadays, most of the students, known as Almajirai learn to be self reliant. And this has seen too many of them spill to the streets to beg for alms and engage in menial work. Sometimes, they are made to engage in forced labour. In 2019, the International Labor Organization revealed that nearly half of Nigerian children are enslaved.\n\nAccording to the ILO, at least 43% of the country\u2019s children are trapped in child labor, including in private businesses. Most of these children are stuck in different forms of forced labor, despite international conventions prohibiting it.\n\nChildren as divine gifts\n\n\u201cChildren\u2026 are what they called Amana; they are a gift from God Almighty\u201d\n\nReacting to the situation, Safiyyah Mohammed, a Sokoto based lawyer and lecturer of the Department of Public Law and Jurisprudence, Faculty of Law, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, gave a full breakdown of why the problem keeps evolving.\n\nOn the part of the government, she said, there are a lot of issues regarding implementation of policies and laws and how to ensure that parents abide by laws set out in our statutes. She said \u201cWe have the Universal Basic Education (UBE) law, which provides that children must be sent to school but then we have issues of not being able to keep track of children whether they are in school or sent to other states. So it becomes difficult.\u201d\n\nSafiyyah argued that, \u201cThere are differences between Western and Islamic culture values,\u201d lamenting that most of these Mallams are not thinking about the danger of setting up schools without regulations.\n\n\u201cWe are bound to have issues because we don\u2019t know the qualifications of most of these Mallams,\u201d she said, adding that one of the key issues regarding the implementation of policies and laws is the attitude of citizens and attitude of individuals as it plays a major role in how the laws are being implemented and carried out.\n\nShe said, several decades ago, the way Almajirici was practiced\u2014 it was \u201csomething noble for a good cause. But the way it is practiced now, parents used it as a way to get away from their responsibilities because when you see the issue of people sending their children to far away places without any means of income, sometimes it is a recipe for a lot of ill in the society.\n\n\u201cIslamic law comprehensively gives children adequate rights. Children under Islamic law are what they called Amana; they are a gift from God Almighty, so they are to be treated in the best of ways. There is nothing that justifies children being sent out for Almajirici and being made to fend for themselves at such a young age.\u201d She expressed emphatically and authoritatively.\n\nWork done seems futile\n\nZainab Yunusa, a co-convener and assistant field officer with Almajiri Child Right Initiative (ACRI) Sokoto Chapter, explained how the organisation has been implementing its mission on the eradication or reformation of Almajiri system, reiterating some difficulties on the part the state government. The ACRI is a non-governmental organization initiated by Muhammad Sabo Keana, advocating for reformation of the Almajiri system in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Yunusa, the organization has been embarking on community sensitization to concerned parents, hosting rallies and conferences, rendering services ranging from medical outreach, food, shelter among others. She revealed the organization has been working tirelessly with the ministry of women and children affairs in tracing, documenting and reintegrating the children back to their parents.\n\nSaddened by the state government\u2019s delayed response regarding this issue, Zainab said that, \u201cThe State government cannot be precise when it would end because it has to do with religion and culture\u2026and many mistake it\u2019s reformation for abolition. So, work done seems zero.\u201d\n\nDuring the course of this story, all effort to reach the state government and ministry of women and children affairs proved abortive, albeit when the Sokoto State Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Honourable Bashir Gorau, was contacted, he said he was not in the right position to respond to questions stressing that all queries should be channeled to the right authorities.\n\nnames changed to protect identity.\n\nThis Investigative Report is supported by Orodata Science.",

          "title": "Criminal herdsmen in Ibarapa aided by jobless indigenes \u2014Igboho monarch",
          "text": "The Ona Onibode, Oba AbdulRasheed Adetoyese, is one of the three traditional rulers in Igboholand, Oke Ogun part of Oyo State. In this interview with GBENGA ADERANTI, Oba Adetoyese talks about his relationship with the other traditional rulers in the community, why attacks on the community by criminal herders have been frequent, the roles that monarchs should play in governance, his relationship with ethnic activist Sunday Igboho and why it is difficult to stop criminal activities in Oke-Ogun area.\n\nThe people of Oke Ogun appear to have suffered more than any other community in Oyo State as a result of attacks by criminal herders. What could be responsible for this?\n\nIn my area here in Oke Ogun 2, we have little problems. When I say Oke-Ogun 2, I am talking about the Saki axis of Oyo State. It is different in Oke-Ogun 1, which is Iseyin and Ibarapa areas. There are more herders there than here. But the herders here have been living with us from time immemorial.\n\nAlso, we have constituted a security committee, and Fulani people who have been living with us for a very long time are members of this committee. Any time they see new sets of herders coming into the community, they would inform the monarch of the town. This has helped us in keeping tabs on the new herders that are coming into Igboho. Also, the Old Oyo National Park is very close to us. There some criminal herders used to hide. But to the glory of God, it is impossible now for the criminal herders to hide because of the combined efforts of local hunters, Amotekun, vigilante and the police.\n\nThe army barracks at Saki also deters criminal herders from using the forest. So crime among herders is not pronounced in our area. We have little problem here, unlike other Ibarapa areas.\n\nWhat do you think the government can do to stop the problem of herdsmen attacking communities?\n\nI don\u2019t think you should limit the problems of insecurity to criminal herders alone. I would prefer we address the crimes being perpetrated by both herders and indigenes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome of our sons are unemployed and they engage in one crime or the other. If the government gives local government autonomy, these problems will be reduced. At least, governance would be nearer to the people. It is sad that graduates do not have anything to do other than ride okada (commercial motorcycles). This set of people is tempted to commit crime or act as accessories to crime if tempted with money.\n\nIf there is local government autonomy, there will be jobs in the community. The law that established the local government should be re-examined and the government should pump more money into the local government.\n\nGovernment should also fund the local hunters in order to fight crimes. They are closer to the community and they know the terrains.\n\nUnfortunately, these criminals have continued to come with different tactics day in and day out.\n\nLook at Niger State; it used to be safe and peaceful, but not anymore. The increase in crime rate is not peculiar to any region in Nigeria. Everybody is feeling the pain of unemployment.\n\nThe crime rate would have been high in this part of Oke-Ogun if not for the security measure we put in place, though we still have pockets of crimes here and there, like herders going to destroy farms. But if you compare this with the way these criminals attack villages in the north, the difference is poles apart.\n\nCrime in Ibarapa is high because some of the indigenes are working in tandem with the criminal herders in perpetrating crimes in the area. Things are worse there because there is a forest in that axis that shares a border with the Benin Republic. The forest is the hideout for the criminals. Government needs to support the local hunters in fighting crime on that axis. If local hunters go there and invade the forest without the support of the government, it could be counterproductive. For example, those who arrested a suspected kidnapper, Wakili, and handed him over to the police were detained. Government needs to find a solution to insecurity. For the problem of Nigeria to be solved, we need a new constitution, not constitution amendment.\n\nIn all this, what role do you think traditional rulers should play?\n\nUnfortunately, the present political arrangement does not favour traditional rulers. The traditional institution is not part of governance. Traditional rulers are not part of political decision making. Yet traditional rulers are closer to the people. For example, here, in each of the local government areas, there are traditional council members. Each council has 15 members who are expected to be meeting periodically. Besides that, we have the ones for states too. But most of them are currently not meeting. Some governors do not even consult these traditional rulers on security matters.\n\nTraditional rulers do not have any role to play in the Nigerian constitution. In the olden days, monarchs were charged with ensuring peace in their communities. But now, the local government chairman is in charge. Even in electing or appointing these local government chairmen, the traditional rulers are not contacted. The traditional institution will address the problem of insecurity if the new constitution is made.\n\nThere are three traditional rulers in Igboho. How have you managed to avoid clashes?\n\nEach of the monarchs has his own domain. If something happens, we call ourselves to manage whatever happens in the wards.\n\nAlso, the government has created wards. In my domain, I have four wards. I have the largest quarters in the town. We are always in touch.\n\nWhen there is a conflict of interests, how do you resolve it?\n\nYes, we sometimes have conflict of interests, but what we have resolved is that whatever benefit is coming, is coming to Igboho and Igboho people are the ones that would benefit. It is one town under the umbrella of three kings. The government is aware that there are three kings in Igboho.\n\nMajority of the people are more familiar with Sunday Igboho than Sunday Adeyemo. What is the relationship between Sunday Igboho and the Igboho community?\n\nSunday Adeyemo is a native of Igboho. He had in many interviews explained that he grew up in Modakeke, Osun State and his father, while living in Modakeke, was known as Baba Igboho because he hailed from Igboho. Then people were calling him Sunday Omo Baba Igboho. Later, they removed the \u2018omo\u2019 and started addressing him as Sunday Igboho when his father left Modakeke and returned to Igboho. He is an Igboho son. His father and mother are from Igboho.\n\nNot all the Yoruba are in support of his crusade, especially his quest for an Oduduwa nation. If you were to advise him, what would you be telling him?\n\nYou should understand that something brought about the agitation. The killing of the Yoruba in Ibarapa area brought about the agitation. Even many people were in pain before his own agitation started. Many people felt these herders would not stop oppressing the natives to the extent that even when their cattle graze on the farms, if the farmer resisted, he would be arrested. And the police were helpless too. Many of the natives were displeased with this. That was the beginning of the agitation. Some who were displeased but could not do anything decided to support him.\n\nFor those who are against him, you should understand that not everybody would accept your cause. Some people who feel that a united Nigeria holds more benefits for them than a fragmented country would not support him. Probably in his own wisdom, he feels if Yoruba stands as a nation, it would be beneficial than being part of a united Nigeria.\n\nEven among the traditional rulers, there is no consensus.\n\nTraditional rulers are suffering. Ideally, we are supposed to assist the populace. But it is not so. And that is why you see traditional rulers pandering to the wishes of politicians. Those who are advising Sunday Igboho to do this or that have reasons for doing so.\n\nTraditional rulers are now running away from tradition and some rites. Do you think this is healthy?\n\nYes, that is true. And there are many reasons for this. If you don\u2019t know the foundation of something, it will be a lot difficult for you to destroy it. If you check the history of Yoruba monarchs, you would see that the majority of them had short reigns. The reason was not far-flung. Most of these people who were privy to the traditional rites had the key to the lives of these monarchs, and they would do anything to terminate the reigns of such traditional rulers if they were displeased with them. But the present day monarchs are wiser. They avoid some of these rites in order not to be entangled. This is the more reason they run away from certain rites and they live longer. Monarchs are more careful now.",

          "text": "Without doubt, the past week will go down as the most turbulent for renowned Yoruba gospel singer, Tope Alabi.\n\nThis followed her open criticism of her younger counterpart, Adeyinka Adesioye aka Alaseyori over her song, Oniduro mi and the controversy that that has trailed it.\n\nThe entire social media space had been agog with huge backlash, with many throlling her for what they considered unrestrained envy on her part.\n\nHowever, Alabi, after a long silence, and a week in which she claims she \u2018has hardly slept\u2019, has come forward with an apology, pleading that Nigerians should see her \u201cas a mere mortal with my own weaknesses, human frailties and as a learner in the limitless knowledge of God.\u201d\n\nHer apology reads: \u201cLet me acknowledge that my mistake was that I externalised a personal message in public and I am awfully sorry for doing that.\n\n\u201cInitially, I didn\u2019t want to delve into the controversy over the gospel hit song, \u2018Oniduro,\u2019 because I had intervened behind the scenes in concert with other stakeholders in gospel music ministry. However, I discovered that online media would not allow the dust to settle calmly.\n\n\u201cI want to state that Tope Alabi, Adeyinka Adesioye a.k.a Alaseyori and Tolu Adelegan are all members of the same family of God and they belong to the same calling \u2013 singing ministry.\n\n\u201cAdeyinka is my daughter in ministry. Her Pastor asked me to pray for her because she took after me, which I did wholeheartedly.\u201d\n\nOn the line of envy, which the social media community has literally over-stretched, Alabi reacts:\n\n\u201cEnvy who? Never! I love the girl so much. She can confirm to you, sir, that we relate so well. God has given each of us the grace to go as far as His enablement could carry us. The atmosphere is wide enough for everyone to stretch her wings of gift without disturbing one another.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m being bombarded with calls and visits by Pastors since Monday morning till now. As we speak, another group of Pastors are coming in now. I guess it is because of this same issue.\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I have been inundated with diverse counsel from different quarters. I hardly sleep since this matter started. While I attend to Nigerian fans on phone calls and online chats in the daytime, our people in the Diaspora will engage me throughout the greater part of the night over the same matter.\n\n\u201c\u2026..I\u2019m not a perfect person yet; I\u2019m still a work in progress in the hands of God. I want people to see me as a mere mortal with my own weaknesses, human frailties and as a learner in the limitless knowledge of God.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am who I am today only by the mercy of God and the support of millions of gospel music lovers. I have no support base elsewhere outside the awesome Nigerians who feel uncomfortable with my statement.\n\n\u201cI see the depth of anger as the measure of their love, admiration and solid support for me and for all of us in the singing ministry.\n\n\u201cLet me acknowledge that my mistake was that I externalised a personal message in public, and I\u2019m awfully sorry for doing that. My friends, colleagues and leaders in ministry who criticised me either openly or privately simply feel disappointed because of the love we share. We are too knitted in the Body of Christ to allow anything to divide us. Human factor is part of our life.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those who keep quiet but chose to intercede for us on their knees instead, may God honour them all. And for those who defended me even without speaking with me, I can\u2019t appreciate them enough.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026 Sister Tolu Adelegan is a woman I hold in high esteem. Adeyinka, like I said earlier, is my daughter in ministry; they are all valuable sisters and associates that nothing can separate us. This is a mere fog, it will fade away in no time.\n\n\u201cFor the comic fellows who are already releasing comedy skits over the matter, I burst into laughter (she laughed again) watching some today.\n\n\u201cWhat a creative people we are. Nigerians are awesome minds who will fashion out tension relieving stuff from every situation.",

          "title": "Charly Boy @ 71 Injustice in Nigeria stinks",
          "text": "By Oscar Nwogu\n\nCharles Chukwuemeka Oputa popularly known as Charly Boy is an enigma of some sort. As maverick as he is, he cannot stop pulling stunts here and there. On June 19, 2020, the ever-bubbly punk king celebrated his 70th birthday with little or no fanfare owing largely to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne year after, the general feeling is that Charly Boy would mark his 71st birthday today, Saturday June 19. But the weird one has pulled his stunt again, defying all logic, as he vowed to mark another 70th birthday. According to him, he has commenced his backward aging process and would be celebrating his 69th birthday next year, as against marking 72.\n\nAsked why he prefers to count his age backward rather than upward, the musician, producer and activist says there is nothing to celebrate going forward. \u201cThe government in power has not done anything to put smiles on the faces of Nigerians. It is confusion, agitation, rape, killings, maiming, stagnation, nepotism, tribalism and clownishness everywhere. There is no hope for the common man. Since there is nothing to celebrate, I would rather remark my 70th birthday this year. Next year, I will mark 69, a process of aging backwards,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, Charly Boy will today celebrate his aging backward birthday with the launch of his EP titled, Odudubariba, which simply means a spiritual warrior. \u201cYes, it\u2019s again my second 70th birthday; next year, I will be 69, and henceforth will continue my backward aging. With the mood of the country and its people, we will keep the celebration simple and low-keyed. I am doing this for my fans and myself. What we are going through in Nigeria today is decades of inaction, docility and my thief better pass your thief mentality. We have been living on corruption money since the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to live as one if we can\u2019t come to the table to resolve our differences. The injustice in Nigeria stinks, that\u2019s why many regions want to go their separate ways. From day one, the foundation of this country was faulty, a scam, and the constitution, fraudulent. We can\u2019t make progress with a faulty foundation. We have no choice but to reap what we have sowed over the years. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the reality of our time,\u201d he said.\n\nAre we expecting fireworks, protests and all sort of razzmatazz from Charly Boy as he counts his age backward? His response: \u201cThe mood in the country doesn\u2019t call for any fireworks, say who die? It\u2019s time for deep, meaningful reflection about our dangerous predicament. I\u2019m not insensitive to the pain my people are passing through. I have retired from active street protest, which has not yielded much with the bunch of people in government today. Two years ago, I retired from active street protest after giving it my all for 45 years. I am not a professional protester. I have reviewed my strategy and I am deploying my frustrations through my music, hence my coming back to one of the powerful tools of resistance: music.\u201d\n\nThe Charly Boy brand means different things to different people. His alternative lifestyle and political views have brought in its wake a mix of bad admirers and haters. On the choice of his outrageous brand, the controversial musician says, \u201cI built this youthful brand to shock and awe ignorant, mongoparkish, analogue, outdated, stupid and idiotic Nigerians out of their potopoto mindset.\u201d\n\nAs president of the Performing Musicians Employers Association of Nigeria (PMAN) many years ago, Charly Boy did not only restore respect and dignity of the Nigerian musicians, he also fought piracy and ensured that artistes had a strong voice in the affairs of the industry. \u201cAs PMAN president, I fought for more respect for the Nigerian artiste, I fought for more money, fought for their intellectual property rights. Today, the Nigerian music and musicians are reaping the fruits of our struggles back in the day.\u201d\n\nThe Area Fada, as he is popularly called, believes that the Nigerian youths need reawakening of their mindset. \u201cIt\u2019s either they are vexed enough to understand what is about to happen or happening to them or they are too scared and rigid to act. It is the docility of the youths that has contributed to my decision to stay on my own and use music, which is a stronger tool, to fight for the people.\n\n\u201cI still believe that the salvation of this country lies in the hands of its exceptional youths. I still can\u2019t see how these ancestors from the 18th century can defeat the millennial of the 21st century. This oppressive government can\u2019t operate in perpetuity. It has an expiration date. But for sure, there will be consequences for our docility over the years. Before it gets better, it will get worse. How do we reason with barbarians and animals in human skin? There is a demonic wind blowing across the country now. Prayers alone can never solve this, we must resolve to strategically push back or accept our fate as slaves,\u201d he averred.\n\nHowever, the veteran musician believes that all hope is not lost for Nigeria. \u201cThere is hope for the country,\u201d he enthused, \u201cit is still the exceptional few, Nigerian youths, that will remedy this country when the chips are down.\u201d\n\nAny regrets? Charly Boy retorted: \u201cRegrets? No. Life is a journey of twists and turns. I have lived a charming life, 90 per cent of the time on my own terms and rules. I was the underdog no one gave a chance. I have lived several lives in one and I am not your regular everyday Nigerian, I am a limited edition. I have no damn regrets. My life is better than most Hollywood fiction. I will forever be my authentic self. I\u2019ll forever keep pushing my dreams with consistency, tenacity, sagacity, audacity and tremendous focus.\u201d",

          "title": "We\u2019re finished: 5 dead, scores injured, 25 vehicles razed in Lagos gas explosion",
          "text": "By Omodele Adigun, Lawrence Enyoghasu And Lukman Olabiyi\n\nIt was a tragedy that nobody saw coming. But by the time it was over, it left five people dead, scores injured, some of them critically, 25 cars burnt and one building structure in complete ruins.\n\nThere is, perhaps, no better way to describe the ruins and destruction caused by the liquefied petroleum tanker explosion that shook Mobolaji Johnson Way, Ikeja, Lagos, to its foundation on Thursday night, precisely at about 11p.m. Said to have been caused by a leaking valve of a moving tanker, it ignited a huge fireball that practically licked up every combustible item on its path. Affected mostly are business owners and employees at Ogun State Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Plaza, Ikeja.\n\nA vulcanizer who lost two cars given to him to sell to the inferno, became the object of pity of sympathizers when he lamented that he wa finished as he didn\u2019t know what to do or to tell the owners.\n\nMany hours later, the smoldering scene still points to a tragedy of immense proportion. Initial report claimed that 13 people, nine males, four females, sustained various degrees of burns in the incident, which occurred in front of the popular Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja. The Acting Zonal Coordinator, South West Zonal Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, informed newsmen that three bodies were initially recovered from the scene of the explosion. But the number later increased to five.\n\nThe affected victims are being attended to at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), he added. \u201cOnly four of the critically injured were transferred to Burn Centre, General Hospital Gbagada at about 0230hours today. The yet-to-be-identified bodies were recovered from the generator house of OPIC Plaza and the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cSearch-and-rescue is still ongoing at the collapsed buildings.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the LPG tanker exploded at about 10.32 hours. The resulting fire travelled with the wind to the premises of Ogun State Property Investment Company (OPIC) Plaza, besides Sheraton Hotel and housing different commercial outfits, including the Chinese Restaurant.\n\nProviding an update on the incident, he said: \u201cThe fire was put out at about 0030 hours following concerted efforts by five fire trucks from Lagos State Fire Service and two from LASEMA Response Unit. Preliminary assessment on vehicles damaged indicated that about 25 were burnt. Comprehensive post-disaster assessment on the extent of general damages would be done later. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos Command, Hakeem Odumosu was at hand and took charge of crowd control and normalised the situation for a successful operation. NEMA, LASTMA, State Fire Service, FRSC and NSCDC were at the scene.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the inferno was reported to have led to the quick evacuation of all guests at Sheraton Hotel. It later led to a heavy traffic congestion that grounded movements on all entrances/exits routes to Ikeja and trapped motorists for several hours. Some of the affected motorists, who made short videos of the incident, blamed the slow response by emergency services for the escalation of the inferno. The videos shared on social platforms showed aggrieved onlookers lamenting how long it took rescuers \u2013 some claimed it was more than 30 minutes \u2013 to get to the scene of the fire incident.\n\nThe Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), in a short message, said all emergency workers were at the scene working to contain the situation. The Director General (DG), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said that the information gathered at the scene revealed that the fire started as a result of explosion while the gas tanker was moving inward Ikeja.\n\nVictims and eyewitness accounts\n\nOscar Odion, a dispatch rider with Sandra Logistics and an eyewitness of the ensuing horror, said that he was on his way back from the day\u2019s work when he saw the fire. Cries of agony rent the air as fire fighters battled hard against the enraging and spreading flame. Smokes and fire billowed from the bodies of people caught in the resultant melee. Some tried to escape only to get crushed by escaping motorists.\n\nHis account: \u201cIt happened around 11 pm yesterday while I was on my way home. I was riding with a friend when we saw the fire. We saw people struggling to escape. A child lay abandoned on the floor. I watched as the building collapsed. We tried to curtail the spread of the fire before fire service people arrived. A guy tried to rescue a victim trapped in the fire. Another guy saved from the fire got knocked down by a vehicle on motion. We mainly engaged ourselves in fetching water from the tap in the compound, because fire service men from the first fire service truck that arrived the scene claimed not to have water. As the fire spread we could not stand and do nothing.\u201d\n\nOluwaseun Olowaremi Peters, a driver with Oasis Supermarket, was not only an eyewitness but much more importantly a survivor of the inferno. When our reporter met him he was in a sober mood and busy quietly telling few people around him how he narrowly escaped death. Donning a pair of oversized black trousers and with his hands folded in praying position, to signify his gratitude to God, he said:\n\n\u201cI wanted to watch the football match. But on realizing that the bet9ja shop had closed, I went back to my car to rest my head and listen to the commentary of the game. But not long after I woke up from sleep to have my night prayer, because I had decided not to go home, I heard a big bang. It was like the sound of a thunder. Everywhere was covered with acrid smoke so much that I could not see. It was painful to the eyes. When I realized it was not raining, I quickly ran out.\n\n\u201cAs I was trying to escape, my trousers got caught up somewhere. I tore it and jumped outside as I saw the enraging fire coming towards me. I thank God that my car\u2019s door opened at once because if it had not, I would have been trapped in the fire. When I jumped from the fence, I landed inside a gas storage tank. All my body became cold up till my toenails. I was immobilized; I could not move. All the same I mustered strength and escaped.\u201d\n\nMuritala Mudasiru, a vulcanizer who lost two cars and two machines to the inferno, was being consoled by friends as he stood behind the yellow demarcating tape, furtively gazing into space.\n\n\u201cI was here till 10 pm before I left for home,\u201d he explained. \u201cI first got the call that a gas trailer had spoiled and released some gas. The fire came from the New China Restaurant. I lost two vulcanizing machines and two cars, Mazda and Toyota Corolla, kept in my custody for sale.\u201d\n\nA little tension rose up yesterday between a team of police officers and some of the victims when the security officers tried to clear and cordon off the scene. One of the victims who gave his name as Niyi decried the police\u2019s attempt to treat him like a miscreant and vehemently objected to it.\n\nLagos State Government has commiserated with Ogun State Government and the families of those who died in the aftermath of the gas explosion which affected OPIC Plaza in Ikeja.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Mr Tayo Bamgbose-Martins issued the condolence message during an assessment visit to the scene of the fire incident\n\nMr Bamgbose-Martins who was in company of his Physical Planning counterpart, Mr Idris Salako, the Commissioner of Police and other key government officials described the incident as very devastating. He assured that due diligence would be done and necessary measures implemented to prevent a reoccurrence.\n\nDirector-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu stated that instead of milling round scenes of emergencies and sending wrong or conflicting information on social media, residents should always report incidents via the 112 and 767 toll free emergency numbers.\n\nThe LASEMA DG disclosed that the carcass of the gas tanker and truck had been evacuated and forensic evidence would be gathered to ascertain whether the recommended safety measures were violated.",

          "title": "Student Dies in Crossfire as Troops Free Five Kebbi School Abductees",
          "text": "\u2022Bagudu visits school, promises all abductees will be rescued\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Ismail Adebayo in Birnin Kebbi\n\nOne of the students abducted by bandits who attacked the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, last Thursday night has died during a crossfire between the kidnappers and security agents.\n\nThe kidnappers, who stormed the school in large number, were armed with sophisticated weapons, abducted 30 students, and killed a policeman. A teacher, a vice-principal, the school\u2019s security officer, and the wife of a teacher, were also abducted.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State visited the affected school yesterday, where he met with the parents, and promised that all abducted students would be freed.\n\nThe shootout that claimed the life of the student happened yesterday morning when the fleeing kidnappers ran into men of the Joint Taskforce of Operation Hadarin Daji in the North-West Zone, at a roadblock, while heading out of Kebbi State.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Force Commander, Operation Hadari Daji, Air Commodore Abubakar Abdulkadir, as a result of the duel, the bandits were forced to abandon five students and a teacher.\n\nSadly, one of the students, who was unidentified, died in the crossfire. No further detail was given on how the death occurred.\n\nAbdulkadir said: \u201cIn the early hours of this morning, we came across the kidnappers. They came to our blocking point, and we engaged them. At that point, they abandoned five of the students and one of the teachers. Unfortunately, I think we lost one of the students.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army in a statement yesterday confirmed the death of the student but attributed the death to \u201cexhaustion during a rescue operation as troops of Operation Hadarin Daji engaged kidnappers in a fire-fight, culminating in the rescue of five students and two teachers of Federal Government College, Yauri.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by the Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops had launched a manhunt for the kidnappers and bandits, following the abduction of the students.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today (yesterday) 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yauri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d it said.\n\nThe update on the abduction said the land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission, intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am.\n\nIt said the troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits and maintained that the gallant troops were still on the heels of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government. The Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good-spirited citizens and wishes to solicit more. \u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya has directed the commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones,\u201d it said.\n\nThe rescued students and teachers are currently receiving medical treatment at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nBagudu Promises Freedom for Abducted Students\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bagudu yesterday met with parents of abducted Yauri students at the school premises, assuring them that they would be rescued soon.\n\nHe assured the parents that the state government, relevant security agencies, and the presidency were working together to rescue the student from the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do anything to bring the children back. We have already engaged the necessary security agencies and they are working to rescue them. All we need to do we have done. What we need from you are your prayers and support.\u201d\n\nBagudu said the state government was alerted two weeks ago that the bandits were sighted around the school area, adding: \u201cWe planned to move them but the school authorities said the students have two weeks left to write their final exams. For this, the commissioner of police was gracious enough to dispatch 22 men and officers from the counter-terrorism unit to the school but they were overpowered because the bandits came in hundreds.\u201d\n\n\u2018How Bandits Took Our Children Away\u2019\n\nWorried parents of the abducted Yauri students yesterday narrated to Governor Bagudu how the bandits came in hundreds, overran the security at the school, and went away with many students.\n\nA parent and one of the cooks engaged for the security personnel deployed to the school, Mrs. Aliheri Gabonchok said she was at the kitchen when the bandits stormed the premises and started shooting sporadically.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen they came, I rushed into hiding with some of the students I could gather. I told them to lie down till the gunshot subsided. I came out when they had left, only to hear from other staff, who also escaped, that they went away with some students, school staff, and even my husband.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Ainan Muhammed, said the bandits who invaded the school were about 400.\n\nAnother parent, Aliyu Wushishi said his five children were among those abducted by the bandits and appealed to the governor to do whatever he could do to rescue the students from the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Yauri, Dr. Sayyanu Abdullahi charged the government to have the political will to deal with banditry.\n\nThe emir also said people in the various communities should see it as their duty to expose those serving as informants to bandits in their communities.\n\nThe royal father gave the charge when governor Badugu visited his palace in Yauri after meeting with some parents of the abducted students.\n\nVehicle Used for Abduction\n\nMeanwhile, the police command in Kebbi State yesterday explained that one of the vehicles used for the kidnaping belongs to a high court judge in the state.\n\nNafi\u2019u Abubakar, the Kebbi police spokesman, said the van was hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road.\n\nAbubakar said the police are yet to determine the number of students kidnapped from the school located in Ngaski LGA of the state.\n\nHe said the reports making the rounds that 50 students were kidnapped from the school were false.\n\nThe Kebbi police spokesman said: \u201cThe attention of the police has been drawn to reports made by some media stations that a police vehicle was used in kidnapping about 50 students of the FGC. A White Hilux Van with registration No. kBSJ 29 belonging to a High Court judge with the inscription of Kebbi State Judiciary, hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road was the one used in the kidnapping and not a police vehicle as stated by some media stations.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to make it clear and set the records straight that yet to be ascertained number of students are still missing as rescue operation is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nThough the Kebbi State Government and the school\u2019s authorities are yet to release the official number of students and staff abducted in the school, unofficial sources said, in all, 30 students and four officials were kidnapped.\n\n\u201c25 students and two officials of the school are still with the kidnappers,\u201d said a source close to the school.\n\nYauri Lawmaker Laments\n\nThe lawmaker representing the Igaski/Shanga/Yauri in Kebbi State at the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sununu, has lamented attacks by bandits in Kebbi State.\n\nSununu warned that the growing insecurity in Kebbi State was a major threat to food security in the country.\n\nSununu said the pervading insecurity in the country was becoming worrisome, saying, \u201cgone are the days when Kebbi used to be the most peaceful in the country.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits \u2013 according to eyewitnesses \u2013 numbering about 250 to 300, each with an AK-47 rifle and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency. They had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles, and cattle. That led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons to the headquarters of the emirate in the town of Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back, and in the early hours of today, they repeated what they had done earlier, and they came into the constituency, somehow around 10:30 am or thereabout. They were able to gain access after strong fights with some security guards and policemen guarding the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, and they made their way into the school.\n\n\u201cThis is a cause for concern and as representative of the people, I had to come here and make a call on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State. It has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the bank of River Niger. We fear that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now, we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security. I have got in touch with security agencies. We had discussions and it has been confirmed to me that military aircraft are in surveillance in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have to make it clear that Kebbi State and indeed Yauri holds a unique position in the food security of this country. Over 90 per cent of the land of Yauri is for rice farming. But as of today, no farmer can comfortably go back to his farm and farm and come back to sleep with his eyes closed.\n\n\u201cWe are right now facing an influx of some people into Yauri with a higher rate of internally displaced persons. Accommodation, feeding, and other necessary logistics are being affected. The worst part of it is that a nation can only develop when it is sound educationally.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Boko Haram is almost becoming a reality because parents cannot feel free to send their wards to school for fear of being kidnapped. As it is now, a lot of primary schools in the emirate in Yauri town are being occupied by IDPs. This tends to deter the progress so far achieved by the Kebbi State Government in terms of agriculture and in terms of promoting access to education.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Osinbajo: Corporate bodies must ensure accountability in service provision\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday charged the MTN Group to make its services affordable and in high quality to its Nigerian subscribers.\n\nThe President\u2019s charge came the same day Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo urged corporate organisations operating in Nigeria, including the MTN, to ensure there is accountability in the provision of services to customers and to pay greater attention to the needs of the people.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the State House, Abuja when he received in audience members of the board of MTN Group led by its President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Mupita, President Buhari said: \u201cNigeria is your most lucrative market in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, as well as the source of a third of the income of the entire MTN Group. As such, we urge you to offer top-of-the-range and affordable service to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs we seek to make broadband widely available and affordable, we urge MTN to continue to support our efforts by expanding high quality connectivity to Nigerians in unserved and underserved areas.\u201d\n\nThe President also called on the group to support the implementation of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cI recently unveiled and launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector. I call on MTN to support the implementation of this policy and train and engage more Nigerians in your company.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we would like you to continue to support our efforts by improving the quality of service and enabling a downward price review of the cost of data and other services, in view of your large market in Nigeria. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe assured his visitors that his administration was doing everything possible to make Nigeria investor-friendly by addressing identified challenges:\n\n\u201cWe are implementing a number of policies and programmes to ensure that institutions like MTN have a conducive environment for doing business in Nigeria. Our massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking is proof that our efforts are yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cWe have identified and addressed the key challenges that affected the growth of the digital economy sector. One of such challenges was the high Right of Way costs and another was the vandalism of critical national infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the Right of Way charges have now been pegged at a maximum of N145/linear metre and I have given directives for the protection of critical national infrastructure and this has addressed the issue of vandalism of such infrastructure. Service providers should always appreciate the effort of government and not undermine it.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari expressed his delight that the Information and communications technology sector was doing very well despite the global economic downturn.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe information and communications technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the report by the National Bureau of Statistics. The sector\u2019s 14.70% double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest growing sector of Q4 2020, which had a growth rate of 3.42%. This is truly commendable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osinbajo, delivered his message on Thursday when he received members of the board of telecoms giant, MTN, led by the company\u2019s Group President and CEO, Mr Ralph Mupita, on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa.\n\nHe stated that it was critical for corporate organisations to show commitment to improving services and to build confidence in the people.\n\nWhile noting that there have been hiccups in the relationship, the VP commended MTN for its contribution to the country, adding that the company is clearly an important part of Nigeria\u2019s story.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cCorporate organisations should be more accountable in their services, in the ownership structure, and also in paying attention to the needs of the people. Companies that ensure this will experience progress, as this is the right direction to go. Going forward, most corporates will find that attaching greater importance to the people is the way to go.\n\n\u201cFor telecommunication firms like MTN, financial inclusion is crucial, so is broadband connection in deepening access and will help to connect hard-to-reach places, and to retail social welfare and services. The company\u2019s investment was crucial when Nigeria needed to show that not only is there a large population in the country, but that it is a large market. The market was severely underestimated for a long time. So, MTN is an important part of our story, we regard MTN as an important partner.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Mupita said that they want to deepen structure of ownership in Nigeria.\n\nWhile disclosing that the company wants to have the largest retail-based shareholding in Nigeria, Mupita said they plan to sell another 14 per cent to Nigerian individuals and institutions.\n\nHe added that MTN as a corporate citizen is responsible in all the countries where it is represented.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe controversy surrounding the power of the President to extend the tenure of any retiring Inspector General of Police, pending the completion of the process of appointing a successor, was yesterday laid to rest with the affirmation of the President\u2019s power to do so by the ruling of a federal high court in Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on February 4 extended the tenure of Mohammed Adamu as Inspector-General of Police by three months after he clocked the mandatory 35 years in service on February 1.\n\nHowever, a legal practitioner, Maxwell Opara, dragged the president and IGP to court, arguing that by virtue of section 215 of the Nigerian Constitution and section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, Adamu cannot continue to function as the IGP, having completed 35 years in service.\n\nIn his defence, the IGP told the federal high court that the new Nigeria Police Act gave him a four-year tenure, which would only lapse in either 2023 or 2024.\n\nSupporting Adamu\u2019s position, President Buhari and the attorney-general of the federation, Abubakar Malami \u2013 who are the second and third defendants in the matter \u2013 told the court through their lawyer that the law permits the IGP to remain in office until either 2023 or 2024.\n\nIn his judgment yesterday, Ahmed Mohammed, the presiding judge, held that since the constitution and the police act empower the president to appoint an IGP, by implication, he could extend the tenure of a retiring IGP before concluding the required consultation with the police council and other processes required for the appointment of a substantive replacement.\n\nThe judge also observed that the constitution and the police act were silent on the issue of whether or not the president could extend the tenure of a retired IGP.\n\nSome senior advocates of Nigeria (SANs) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had assailed Buhari for extending Adamu\u2019s tenure.\n\nThey declared his action as violating the 1999 Constitution as (amended) and the Police Act (2020).\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Mr. Mohammad Dingyadi, told State House reporters in Abuja that Adamu\u2019s tenure elongation would allow for proper screening of all qualified senior police officers before the eventual choice of a new IG.\n\nHe said then: \u201cMr. President has decided that the present IG, Mohammed Adamu, will continue to serve as the IG for the next three months to allow for a robust and efficient process of appointing a new IG.\n\n\u201cThis is not unconnected to the desire of Mr. President to not only have a smooth handover but to also ensure that the right officer is appointed into that position. Mr. President is extending by three months to allow him to get into the process of allowing a new one.\u201d\n\nAdamu was eventually retired on April 6, when the current IGP, Usman Alkali was named by the President as the acting IGP.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj. Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the president\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in ending the war.\n\nHe thanked the president for the visit to the troops, which he said would greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively; Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo; Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao, and National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), were also at the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum thanked the president for the relative peace in the state, buoyed by the heavy presence of military and security men who have been engaging the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed the gradual return of peace to Borno State and it is our sincere hope that insurgency will soon be brought to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor appreciated the president for various developmental interventions, which include infrastructure, particularly the approval of 10,000 units of housing for IDPs of which 4,000 had been completed.\n\nPresident Thanks Nigerians for Opportunity to Serve\n\nIn the meantime, the president has expressed his gratitude to Nigerians for the opportunity given to him to serve them.\n\nHe said under his watch, efforts would be made to improve the livelihood of Nigerians, starting with adequate security.\n\nHe said at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Garbai El-Kanemi, that he started his administrative career as a military officer in Borno State as a governor for seven months, under Gen. Murtala Muhammed, before he was appointed Minister of Petroleum by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was then a military head of state.\n\nHe added: \u201cMy commitment to serve Nigerians is a payback for the love shown to me. I started my political adventure in Maiduguri and I always look forward to coming here.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, El-Kanemi thanked the president for consistent response to the plight of the people in the state, saying that the security situation has improved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "After suspending Twitter, Nigerian government intensifies bid to control online media",
          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "title": "A lamplight on technology and autism spectrum disorder in Africa",
          "text": "From the Massai tribe in Kenya to the Yorubas in Nigeria, the birth of a child is a delightful and highly celebrated event in Africa. There\u2019s cooking and tons of prayers spoken over the child, and, of course, its parents are overwhelmed with a lifetime\u2019s worth of parenting advice.\n\nBut what happens when a child fails to reach expected developmental milestones? For example, how should parents handle a four-year-old who doesn\u2019t respond appropriately to things happening around, is overly sensitive to specific sights and sounds, and hasn\u2019t spoken their first words yet?\n\nIn most parts of Africa, the immediate response is fear as such challenges are believed to result from spiritual problems. However, the likelihood of these being symptoms of a neurological disorder is hardly entertained.\n\nA report by Spectrumnews reveals that autism goes undiagnosed in African children until they are eight years old, unlike their American counterparts, who are diagnosed four years earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAutism from the African lens\n\nMedically known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), autism is a neurological developmental disability characterised by various symptoms, including nonverbal speech patterns, hypersensitivity to specific sights, sounds and colours, and, in some cases, intellectual impairment.\n\nOverall, it is a diverse group of conditions that primarily affects the ability to communicate and interact with one\u2019s immediate environment appropriately.\n\nUsually, it appears fully by age 2 or 3 but can be diagnosed as early as 12 months. Unlike Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, autism mostly comes with no physical signs.\n\nIt is a medically diagnosed condition, and because of its complexity and broad range of characteristics, it should not be diagnosed by non-medical personnel.\n\nDiagnosing autism is a challenge in Africa because of several superstitious beliefs associated with the condition and the unavailability of the proper medical infrastructure required to run the tests.\n\nIn some parts of the continent, people living with autism are \u201clabelled as devils, and they are not diagnosed or given treatment. Some people believe that the disorder is punishment for a parent\u2019s bad behaviour or an affliction,\u201d says Bernadette Lamar, a Sierra Leonean who runs a behavioural healthcare centre.\n\nDue to a lack of inadequate information, parents with autistic children in Africa are usually left with no choice but to seek help from spiritual sources. And to avoid stigmatisation, they lock up their children, keeping them out of plain sight.\n\nIn 2002, Zemi Yenus founded Ethiopia\u2019s first school for children with autism after her son was diagnosed with the condition. He had been rejected from multiple mainstream schools, and she had a hard time finding special needs children teachers in Ethiopia who knew what autism was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo she used her savings from her old job as a beautician to open her school in a small rented Addis Ababa house. She called it The Joy Center of Excellence for Autism and kicked off with just four children, including her son.\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Yenus passed on from COVID-19-related complications. Her centre currently caters for hundreds of Ethiopian children living with ASD.\n\nSome data to run with\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation statistics, globally, 1 in 160 children has ASD. With sketchy data on children living with autism in Africa, it is difficult to arrive at a figure for the continent.\n\nNevertheless, a 2019 Autism Society of Kenya (ASK) report revealed that in Kenya alone, there was likely to be 1 autistic child for every 25 children. And a globalliving.org report estimates that Ethiopia has 600,000 autistic children.\n\nWHO\u2019s global ratio might be very different if the Organisation accounted for Africa\u2019s autism figures. But that is neither here nor there in a discussion about the challenges autistic children and their parents face in Africa.\n\nHow tech fits into the picture\n\nCurious to discover how technology can create awareness and help autistic children lead better lives, I spoke with Mrs C. Adedeji, a special needs children instructor.\n\nShe mentioned how various applications and e-tools could assist parents and instructors in delivering individual-based lessons to these children.\n\nFrom our conversation, I learnt that autistic children, like everyone else, come with a unique, innate skill-set to harness adequate time and attention.\n\n\u201cIn my years as a caregiver for special children, it\u2019s a thing of joy and reward when I see children that I\u2019ve taught and nurtured \u2014 alongside somewhat tired and hopeful parents \u2014 do things for themselves and even build their talents. Because, like everyone else, they are gifted and can make meaningful contributions to the world,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nThankfully, technology can assist learning and help autistic children grow, improve verbal communication, learn speech patterns, and build social interaction skills.\n\nShe confirmed that \u201ca lot of apps are so effective in helping and improving the lives of these children through self-guided learning and the removal of a structure common to most brick and mortar classes.\u201d\n\nWith mobile apps, video games, and medically approved online resources available, autistic children stand a better chance to manage the disorder today than they did years ago.\n\nThe slow rate of Internet penetration remains a big hindrance to parents and special children instructors who need technological assistance to care for and teach these children in most African countries.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, I think the best option is for the government of most African countries to see this as a cause for concern and foster the integration of special needs technological materials in our regular schools,\u201d Adedeji added.\n\nThere is currently no cure for ASD, and because it is a spectrum disorder, the symptoms vary from mild to acute. However, a range of treatments can be administered to manage it better.\n\nMobile applications like Language Therapy for Kids \u2013 MITA, Speech Blubs 2, Otsimo and others help administer Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH) \u2014 individual-based visual learning methods \u2014 to children living with autism and also assist instructors and parents in caring for them.\n\nThese apps should not replace a strong community of support from parents, a good special needs children instructor, and an inclusive society.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe most effective way to manage ASD is early diagnosis, and this is another area where technology has helped.\n\nThe electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test tool used to detect the brain\u2019s electrical activity. It can also serve as a biomarker for ASD. A team of researchers in South Africa decided to test the effectiveness of this technology.\n\nThey discovered that the biomarker could differentiate between ASD in typically developing children and those whose genes showed some signs of ASD but were not with the condition. The results had a 90% accuracy.\n\nA greater cause for concern\n\nBeyond the challenge of a lack of data on autism, the stigmatisation autistic children and their parents face in Africa is a major problem.\n\nThis is because the disorder is considered more of a spiritual condition than a medical one that can be effectively managed.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand this is purely a medical condition. It can happen to anyone regardless of their background. A lot needs to be done in our part of the world in terms of education, acceptance, and understanding,\u201d said Amoah, coordinator at a treatment centre for children with disabilities in Accra, Ghana.\n\nChildren living with autism can learn to live with the disorder if accepted and managed rather than rejected and stigmatised. By making room for the range of diversities that characterise our world, we can make the world a better place.\n\nHappy Autistic Pride Day!",

          "text": "To divert the people\u2019s attention from misrule, Roman emperors organised bawdy games in rowdy arenas where bloodlust found expression in deadly gladiator fights.\n\nThe Nigerian government has evolved a more sinister approach, it wants to squelch every dissenting voice even as it seeks to burrow into the ground after setting the bar of governance so low it\u2019s practically on the ground.\n\nIn the proposed amendments to the Nigerian Press Council Act, the Nigerian president will appoint the board and members who will issue licences to newspapers and online outlets, write a press code, and jail journalists and media houses who violate it.\n\nAfter banning social media microblogging site, Twitter, the Nigerian government is coming for the press to muzzle the last bastion of criticism against inept leadership.\n\nThe current set of servile lawmakers, some of the most craven ever seen in Nigeria\u2019s democratic experience, is gearing up to review the Nigerian Press Council Act despite a pending Supreme Court case over some proposals in the 2018 amendment attempt that violated constitutional provisions.\n\nOlusegun Odebunmi, a lawmaker representing Ogo-Oluwa/Surulere Federal Constituency of Oyo State is once again leading the campaign to muzzle the press.\n\nHe has the support of Nigeria\u2019s information minister, Lai Muhammed, who rode into power on the crest of disinformation and patent-worthy smear campaign against the previous administration. Now he\u2019s getting a taste of his own pudding, he croons about national cohesion.\n\nOdebunmi, it must be recalled was also the lawmaker behind last year\u2019s obnoxious bill to amend Section 308 of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution to extend Immunity to lawmakers.\n\nIronically, many of his colleagues even from the same party opposed the bill, including the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, who said he would only support the proposal if it would take effect from 2023 after the end of the tenure of the current leadership.\n\nBut it was a dubious exercise since lawmakers are already covered by parliamentary immunity under the Legislative Houses (Powers and Privileges) Act, 2018, which means they are immune from civil or criminal proceedings for anything they say in parliament.\n\nOdebunmi and some of his colleagues resolved to take the bill to Nigerians through a public hearing. In a country where many are calling for the withdrawal of immunity granted to governors and the president due to widespread abuse, a public hearing is not expected to produce a different outcome.\n\nThe Nigerian Press Council Act Cap N128 LFN 2004 was first enacted in 1992 to repeal the Nigerian Media Council Act 1988 and established the Nigerian Press Council (NPC).\n\nUnder this Act, the NPC is recognised as the body charged with the responsibility of overseeing the activities of the Nigerian press.\n\nSome have criticised the body as being inadequate to respond to current challenges with false news and unethical practice but what obtains in many democracies is self-regulation as well as laws against libel for published material that is injurious and slander for broadcast materials that impugns the reputation of others.\n\nNigeria seeks to criminalise what is essentially a civil matter. It started with the 2015 Cybercrimes Act in which section 24 criminalises messages or other matters sent using computer systems or network by a person which he knows to be false.\n\n\u201cIt also qualifies the motive as \u201cfor the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, destruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill-will or needless anxiety to another,\u201d said Chudo Nwakanma, chief executive of Blueflower Limited, a communications firm.\n\nOffenders could be jailed for a term of 10 years and or a minimum fine of N25 million.\n\n\u201cThe Cybercrimes Act 2015 creates a situation of double jeopardy. There are now two laws in the Statute books on defamation, one civil and the other criminal.\n\nIn the proposed amendment to the Nigerian Press Council, the Buhari government is seeking to criminalise journalists and the practice of journalism, become a regulator for journalism and journalism training and determine who could practice the profession, the responsibility of the National Universities Commission and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission.\n\nThe Bill appears to be a subtle crossbreed of the obnoxious military decrees: the Public Officers [protection Against False Information] Decree No.4 of 1984 enacted under then Head of State, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, and the Newspapers Registration Decree No.43 of 1993. Incidentally, the former military ruler is now the elected President.\n\nThe proposed bill is unconstitutional as it runs against the principles and tenets of the rule of law and seeks to incapacitate the media in the exercise of the duties and obligations imposed on it by section 22 of the constitution to hold the government accountable to the people.\n\nThe bill seeks for the Nigeria Press Council to usurp the powers of the courts by assuming extra-judicial powers and unduly interfere with the operations of the media in Nigeria as businesses registered under the relevant laws of the federation.\n\nOpposition\n\nIt is dangerous for the government to regulate an institution created by the constitution to hold it accountable. The press when it functions right, keeps politicians honest, shines a light on their worst instinct, warns of impending dangers and helps the public understand the world better.\n\nThe Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO) comprising the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), and the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) have told lawmakers to shelve the bill.\n\nThe organisation objected to the bill during a public hearing on the bill on Thursday organised by the House Committee on Information, Culture, Ethics, and Values. Seventeen out of the 39 clauses in the bill are parts of litigation since 1999.\n\nHowever, in his response, Odubunmi said the court process would not stop the committee from discharging its constitutional function of making laws.\n\nA coalition of civil society organisations comprising, Premium Times Centre For Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Media Rights Agenda (MRA), International Press Centre (IPC), and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint memorandum, also highlighted some clauses in the bill.\n\nLanre Arogundade, executive director of IPC, at the public hearing urged the committee to adopt the paths of Ghana and South Africa in the formulation of laws on media.\n\n\u201cSection 33 (3) and (4) does not give room for retraction and apology where a fake news is mistakenly published but recommends a blanket sanction up to ten million naira or closure for a period of one year or both.\u201d",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC. We make sure that we don\u2019t duplicate efforts. NDDC has not been forthcoming with contracts that have been awarded at that level.\n\n\u201cIn a normal system, if the NDDC has lived up to their responsibility and done the right thing, the government will not need to do the same project. We don\u2019t duplicate work; it amounts to a waste of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNDDC left the road in a worse shape than it was before the construction started. It is not an excuse to allow the people suffer, following the failure of an agency to perform their statutory responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs soon as possible, we would send government agencies to check the immediate state of the road and report back. We will do something quick for our people at Urhonigbe because we know that our people are predominantly farmers.\n\n\u201cWe would deploy officials from the Ministry of Infrastructure to examine the state of the road to enable us to provide palliative measures before providing a permanent solution to the road. As an administration, we will do our best to ensure that the people of the community feel the impact of the government.\u201d\n\nAppreciating the people of Ugha Quarters for the support before, during and after the governorship election in the state, the governor noted: \u201cI appreciate you for your support and prayers before, during and after the election, as well as your support throughout the time in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe last election proved to us that you trust this administration and I want to assure you that the confidence reposed in us will not be betrayed. We will deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of the State, including Ugha Quarters in Urhonigbe.\n\n\u201cAs a candidate, I visited the 192 wards of Edo State and know what the people want; I am prepared to ensure that we improve the standard of living of our people.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Odiowere of Ugha Quarters, Michael Evharevba, whose speech was read by the Secretary, Michael Omorotionmwan, congratulated the governor and his deputy on their victory in the September 2020 governorship election and the subsequent successes at the courts.\n\n...",

This, the court held, was so because they were denied fair hearing as required by law.\n\nMr Eko held that the actions of the LPDC panels which led to the punishment of the three lawyers were not consistent with provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cDeciding complaints against the lawyers without participating in the hearing of the panels is tantamount to denying the appellants fair hearing,\u201d Mr Eko said.\n\n\u2018Composition of LPDC panel wrong\u2019\n\nThe judge also faulted the conviction of the lawyers on the grounds bordering on composition of the panels.\n\nSome of the members of the LPDC panels who signed the verdict convicting the lawyers were said not to have participated in the whole proceedings as required by law.\n\nMr Eko noted that the composition of the LPDC panels was too wieldy, counselling that a panel should not have more than three or four members to ensure proper attendance.\n\nHaving set aside the conviction, Mr Eko ordered that the three lawyers be made to face different panels to be constituted by the LPDC.\n\n\u201cThe matter is hereby remitted to a fresh panel to be heard denovo (afresh),\u201d Mr Eko held.\n\nPrevious panels\n\nOne of the previous LPDC panels, whose decisions were upturned on Friday, was headed by a serving Justice of the Supreme Court, Abdul Aboki, who was then a judge of the Court of Appeal.\n\nAnother of the panels was led by the late Chief Judge of Kogi State, Nasir Ajana.\n\nA former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Joseph Daudu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, equally chaired one of the LPDC panels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLPDC\n\nThe LPDC is the body recognised by law to take disciplinary action against lawyers called to the Nigerian bar accused of professional misconduct.\n\nFor a case to be brought before the LPDC, a petition must first be filed with the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) which reviews it and finds out if there is a prima facie case to proceed with the case.\n\nIf the NBA, the body of all Nigerian lawyers, finds out that there is prima facie case against the reported lawyer, it will then file a case against the lawyer at the LPDC which will then constitute a panel to hear the petition.\n\nThe NBA serves as the prosecution in the trial before the LPDC panel.\n\nBy law, either of the defence of the prosecution dissatisfied with the final decision of the LPDC can only appeal to the Supreme Court.",

          "title": "NCARD: FG, stakeholders call for private sector investment in agricultural development",
          "text": "By Nneka Nwogwugwu\n\nThe Federal government and stakeholders in the agricultural sector have called for private sector investment in the development of Nigeria\u2019s agricultural sector.\n\nThe stakeholders made this call at the end of the 44th Regular Meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD) on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nDeclaring the event open, the minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono noted major contributions the present administration has achieved in developing the agric sector despite the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn his remarks, he said, \u201cThe challenges brought by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and insecurity has galvanized the government into setting up necessary structures (and upgrade existing ones) to address infrastructural deficiency, technology gaps, security challenges and extension inadequacy.\n\n\u201cAs a stop-gap intervention, we launched the Agric for Food and Jobs Program, originally conceived as an input loan for smallholder farmers across several commodities including maize, rice, cotton, groundnut, sorghum, cowpea, soybean, sesame, cassava and oil-palm.\n\n\u201cThe scheme brought into a partnership the Central Bank of Nigeria, Commodity Associations and Agricultural Platform Companies for effective facilitation. This we believe will not only improve production significantly but also aid in the off-taking of the produce while providing input at reduced price due to economy of scale.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the input gets to the intended farmers, we created a database for all the participating farmers in the AFJP. Unlike anything that has been done before, we set out to capture the biodata of the farmers and link this with the geographical information of their farmed plots, their crops and the volumes they produce.\n\n\u201cAll this will feed into the monitoring and evaluation system of the project so that we can measure impact along the line. Although we initially set out to capture the data of 2.4million farmers across the country, the results from the exercise have encouraged the Economic Sustainability Plan team to expand the data capture to 10million farmers.\n\n\u201cThis database is going to be the platform for government interventions going forward, putting an end to ghost schemes and other unscrupulous practices in the agricultural industry.\u201d\n\nCalling on the private sector for increased efforts in investing in the sector, Nanono noted that enquiries have been received from several international bodies on how they may participate in the National Livestock Transformation Plan either in financial or technical capacity.\n\nAccording to him, a Dutch consortium which is partnering the Federal Government for the implementation of the first pilot state was able to attract a grant from their home country of Netherlands for the start-up of the National Livestock Transformation Plan pilot in Nasarawa State.\n\n\u201cThis pilot site will serve as a hub for knowledge and skills transfer to the pastoralist community, who will be encouraged and hand-held to adopt ranching, to practice what they have learnt. The National Livestock Transformation Plan has been adjudged worldwide to be a well-conceived project which seeks to transform our livestock sector from nomadic-dependent sector into an organized ranching one.\n\n\u201c To this end, 22 State and the Federal Capital Territory have registered with the NLTP Office, out of which 10 States have created their own teams which have been trained by the Federal Office. Seven of these 10 States have also earmarked about 19 Grazing Reserves for the implementation of the NLTP, with a total land size of approximately 400,00 hectares,\u201d he added.\n\nHighlighting other programmes introduced by his administration, he outlined that, \u201crice was included in the list of items for which importation facility provision (forex) was stopped since the inception of this administration.\n\n\u201cThe dividend of that action has been improvement in the quality of rice processed within Nigeria and has improved earning for the rice farmers and placed their association, RIFAN, at a vantage point for negotiating loan deals for farmers with funding entities.\n\nAmong other achievements by the Ministry, the minister also added \u201cwe have entered into partnership with the government of Brazil through one of their foremost technology transfer institution, the Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV).\n\n\u201c This partnership has yielded an Agricultural Mechanisation loan to the tune of nine hundred and ninety five million euros(\u20ac995m). This shall be granted to Nigerian entrepreneurs to establish Service Centres across all the 774 Local Governments of the country, selling services to all categories of farmers and thereby helping to improve their productivity. The service centres shall be of either a Type 1, supporting production activities; or a Type 2, supporting processing and packaging activities.\n\n\u201cWe also have the target to improve on the export front and to this end, necessary support is being given for increase in the export of Agricultural commodities like Sesame, Hibiscus, Cotton and Sorghum. The Nigerian Export Promotion Council has been working with the Ministry of Agriculture to exploit our strategic advantage in the production of these commodities, improving our production protocols to conform with internationally acceptable standards, maintenance of an exporters\u2019 directory and \u2018Exporter certificate verification\u2019 portal, generation of Product map and improving our visibility through the attendance of International Trade Shows. All this is geared towards improving our export profile thereby improving our Forex Earning capacity which is necessary at this period of oil market volatility.\n\n\u201cAs part of the strategies to implement the Nigerian Correctional Service act, the Nigerian Prisons Service established farms which are to serve as training grounds to inmates serving time at the different prisons. Prison farms are essential for the new correctional services act to fulfil its aim of reforming, rehabilitating and reintegrating offenders.\u201d\n\nEarlier speaking, the minister of state for Agriculture, Hon. Mustapha Baba Shehuri added that the Nigerian Economy had its GDP contracted for two consecutive terms i.e 2nd and 3rd Quarters in 2020 leading to recession.\n\nHe said it was in the 4th Quarter of 2020 that the economy returned to positive growth with GDP expanding to 0.1% from negative growth of 3.6%, Agricultural Sector was part of the achievement. As a matter of fact, the local production of Maize, Rice, Cassava, Potatoes, Yam and other staples steadily increased. It is also the same story for Livestock, Fisheries and Dairy sector.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we did not import food during the lockdown was a testimony that we can grow what we eat and eat what we produce. This unique effort in the Agricultural sector resulted in sharp decline in the Nation\u2019s major food import bills on Rice, Wheat, Milk products and Frozen Fish.\n\n\u201cI salute the effort of our farmers and other stakeholders who worked under difficult and challenging environment to boost the production of our major staples,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) representative in Nigeria, Fred Kafeero stated that private investors involvement in agriculture is a call for action to cushion effects of COVID-19.\n\nKafeero also urged that investments and technical assistance should be mobilised, adding that research in Nigeria should also be strengthened.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s country Director, Actionaid, Ene Obi called on the private sector to approve and support the Federal Agric Ministry and state Ministries to allocate funding for Agriculture and smallholder farmers including women farmers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Free access to social media is robbing youths of their future \u2015 Oyedepo\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the farmers, the president of the All farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Farouq Mudi while explaining the importance of private investment , noted that the association has started establishing projects in collaboration with the private sector.\n\nHe informed that Brains and Hammers, a real estate company is partnering with the Ministry to deepen water irrigation techniques to enhance crop production in Nigeria.\n\nResponding to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) report, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr. Ernest A. Umakhihe said the meeting will give way for stakeholders to mitigate global hunger concerns in 20 nations.",

          "text": "*Troops on hot pursuit of abductors rescue 2 teachers, 5 students\n\n.*One female student confirmed dead\n\nAndrew Orolua, Abuja with agency report\n\nA member of the House of Representatives, Tanko Sununu, has described the attack on the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri in Kebbi State, as a promise fulfilled by bandits.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Ngaski/ Shanga/ Yauri Federal Constituency, said that Thursday\u2019s incident was the latest in the chain of attacks on communities in the area.\n\nWhile featuring as a guest on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Friday, Sununu narrated what transpired in the build-up to the attack that left a yet-to-be-ascertained number of students of the school missing.\n\nHear him: \u201cWhat really happened is that about two weeks ago, we had an episode when bandits residing within parts of the areas bordering Zamfara, Niger, and Kebbi came up through one of the villages in my constituency.\n\n\u201cThey killed a policeman and found their way until they reached Ibeto area where we have a quarry, killed some security men and kidnapped some of the foreign workers in the quarry and left.\n\n\u201c10 days later, they came back to the same area and entered into my constituency bordering some villages, and they had more than a seven-hour field operation going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, phones, cows, and any machine they deemed useful for their operations, and they left a message behind that they would soon be back.\n\n\u201cTo fulfill their promise yesterday (Thursday), we had intelligence that they were on their way coming. Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d\n\nSununu noted that as soon as the bandits got to the school, they were faced with a tough task as they were initially resisted and engaged in a gunfight by operatives of the Mobile Police and Police Counter-Terrorism Unit stationed at the school.\n\nHe disclosed that the fire exchange lasted for a long period before the bandits overpowered the security operatives due to their large number.\n\nThe bandits, the lawmaker stated, succeeded in killing a policeman and gained access into the school and abducted an unspecified number of students and five teachers.\n\nHe explained that it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of students abducted as parents from nearby villages and towns raced to the school to take their children away immediately after the incident.\n\nSununu, however, gave an assurance that the military has swung into action, noting that progress has been made.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs at last night, I had a discussion with the Field Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji who said that they have succeeded in entering into the den of the kidnappers and I think this is a major success because the security agencies are now taking the fight to the base of the kidnappers\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian Army said on Friday that its troops operating under the auspices of Operation Hadarin Daji have been on hot pursuit of bandits who abducted some students and teachers from Federal Government College, Birnin Yawuri on Thursday, June 17, 2021\n\nIt said in a statement signed by the new Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, that two teachers and five students have so far been rescued after a fierce exchange of fire with the criminals.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yawuri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled.\n\n\u201cWith one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am and engaged them in a fire fight leading to the successful rescue of the teachers and students.\n\n\u201cThe troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits. The gallant troops are still on the heels of the kidnappers in order to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cSadly, a casualty was recorded during the exchange. A female student was found to have given up the ghost as a result of exhaustion. The rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government\u201d, he stated.\n\nNwachukwu said the Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good spirited citizens and wishes to solicit for more.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya, has directed the Commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones.\n\nIn the meantime, Police authorities in Kebbi State have given more updates on the abduction of an unspecified number of students from the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\n\nMr. Nafi\u2019U Abubakar, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, disclosed that the gunmen used a stolen vehicle to convey the abducted students.\n\nHe made the disclosure in a statement on Friday in reaction to reports that the bandits who attacked the school used a police vehicle to kidnap about 50 students from the school.\n\nAbubakar explained that the assailants used a white Hilux van marked KBSJ 29, which was hijacked along the Birnin-Yauri Road, to perpetrate the crime.\n\nHe insisted that the bandits never used any police van as claimed, adding that the number of students missing after the incident was still unknown.\n\nAccording to the command spokesman, a rescue operation to ensure the safe return of the students is ongoing by the security agencies.\n\nHe promised that the police would give more updates on the progress made as events unfold and warned against spreading false information.",

It unconsciously robs people of their future by robbing them of their time,\u2019\u2019 Oyedepo said at the 7th Convocation of the institution.\n\nHe was speaking on: \u201cCombating the challenge of education without integration.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThis social media saga has eroded the substance of destiny of most youths today.

          "text": "Governor Nasir El Rufai has said Kaduna state has started implementing its rightsizing policy by disengaging 99 political appointees, but is yet to disengage any state civil servant.\n\nThe governor disclosed that only agencies connected to the local government system have disengaged staff and these include the 23 local government councils, SUBEB and the Primary Health Care Board.\n\nEl-Rufai who made the disclosure at a media chat with some Kaduna-based broadcast journalists on Thursday night, explained that the disengaged political appointees constitute 30% of political office holders.\n\n\u2018\u2019So far, 99 political appointees have lost their jobs but we have not commenced rightsizing civil servants. We want to be fair with regards to civil servants. We had earlier promised that before we reduce the size of the civil service, we will start with political appointees and we have done that,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor who spoke in Hausa, said that the rightsizing of civil servants will still go on as planned because of dwindling revenues that is accruing to the state government from the federation account.\n\nEl Rufai explained that the rightsizing commenced with political appointees because their details are clearly known, making it more straightforward to disengage them.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, civil servants with question marks on the veracity of their data have to be given a chance to clear the doubts before any action is taken on them,\u2019\u2019 he clarified.\n\nThe governor said that his government has employed 11,000 more workers in the health sector, Kaduna State University as well as primary and secondary school teachers across the state.\n\nThe governor disclosed that it is a fallacy to allege that the salaries of political appointees account for the bloated personnel cost of Kaduna State Government.\n\n\u2018\u2019In March 2021, the salaries of these political appointees amounted to N259 million , while civil servants were paid N3.13 billion, aside from costs related to state contributions to pension, accrued rights and other personnel costs. So, it is false to insinuate that political appointees are the ones that guzzle most of the state\u2019s resources,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nJustifying the rightsizing of the public service, he said that all states and the federal government are affected by this shortfall of revenue and some states have even reverted to paying the old monthly minimum wage of N18,000.\n\n\u2018\u2019Kaduna State cannot continue to use 84% to 96% of our revenues to pay salaries of less than 1% of the population. The rest of our people, all 99% of them, need better schools, hospitals, water supply, roads, markets and support for agriculture to make a living outside government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor however promised that Kaduna state will not reverse the N30,000 minimum wage that it has started paying.\n\n\u201cWe are the first government, federal or state, to pay the minimum wage. We will retain the minimum wage of N30,000 and the consequential adjustments that gave most of our civil servants a 66% salary increase. We will also retain the minimum pension of N30,000 monthly.\n\n\u201cThe unified Local Government Service continues to pay the minimum wage, even though they varied the consequential adjustments for their workers below the level for state civil servants,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe governor also promised that the state will still fund free education from primary 1 to the SS3, adding that \u2018\u2019we have directed our Ministry of Education to find ways of ensuring that we sponsor students for WAEC exams, the same way that we sponsor them for NECO. \u2018\u2019\n\nEl Rufai emphasized that basic education is a priority for Kaduna State Government because \u2018\u2019we see it as the bedrock for equality of opportunity.\u2019\u2019",

Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d\n\nA Major Success\n\nSununu noted that as soon as the bandits got to the school, they were faced with a tough task as they were initially resisted and engaged in a gunfight by operatives of the Mobile Police and Police Counter-Terrorism Unit stationed at the school.\n\nHe disclosed that the fire exchange lasted for a long period before the bandits overpowered the security operatives due to their large number.\n\nThe bandits, the lawmaker stated, succeeded in killing a policeman and gained access into the school and abducted an unspecified number of students and five teachers.\n\nHe explained that it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of students abducted as parents from nearby villages and towns raced to the school to take their children away immediately after the incident.\n\nSununu, however, gave an assurance that the military has swung into action, noting that progress has been made.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs at last night, I had a discussion with the Field Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji who said that they have succeeded in entering into the den of the kidnappers and I think this is a major success because the security agencies are now taking the fight to the base of the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI was also told that over 800 cattle that were rustled some days back have been recovered and as of now, the military has combed the area where we are expecting that the students are with the bandits. They have also succeeded in creating many casualties on the part of the bandits.\u201d",

          "text": "No fewer than three persons have been confirmed killed in a gas tanker explosion in the Ikeja area of Lagos State.\n\nMr Ibrahim Farinloye, a spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), disclosed this in a telephone interview with Channels Television on Friday.\n\nThe incident occurred on Thursday night after a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) tanker exploded at Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, affecting a plaza housing dozens of organisations.\n\n\u201cThe latest is that we just recovered three dead bodies this morning, which was beyond our expectation,\u201d said Farinloye while giving an update on the incident on Sunrise Daily.\n\nHe added, \u201cYesterday, we made a headcount and management officials of the plaza were around, officials of all the organisations using the plaza were around; only one boy was claimed to be missing and unfortunately, we could not trace the boy yesterday night.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when we got there this morning, we saw three dead \u2013 one Mr Balogun who was the manager of the Chinese restaurant. He was recovered with two other personnel of the restaurant.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe NEMA spokesman noted that the victims seemed to have made an attempt to escape from the building when the incident occurred.\n\nHe explained that this possibly led to their death, while the boy said to be missing since Thursday night had yet to be found.\n\nThe explosion, said to have been caused by a leakage while the LPG tanker was in motion, threw the environment into panic as a result of the huge fire that ensued.\n\nThis also left some people wounded with four of them taken to the Trauma and Burns Centre at the General Hospital, Gbagada.\n\nFarinloye noted that the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, led a team of policemen to the scene on Friday in a bid to restore normalcy in the area.\n\n\u201cRecovery effort will continue this morning. Thirteen people sustained injury \u2013 four women and nine men. 25 vehicles were destroyed completely.\n\n\u201cThe police personnel were left behind to take care of the whole situation. The whole situation is under control,\u201d he said.",
