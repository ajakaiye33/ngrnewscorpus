          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri \u2013 Abuja\n\nMr Ifeanyi Ejiofor, lead counsel to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, on Tuesday, berated the Department of State Services, DSS, for granting a former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, private access to his client in detention.\n\nEjiofor, who described Kalu\u2019s visit to his client as \u201cbizarre and unusual\u201d, maintained that it was in gross violation of the court-ordered guideline for visitation.\n\nHe alleged that the DSS gave the erstwhile governor access to the IPOB leader before the time scheduled for a formal visit.\n\nIt will be recalled that Kalu, who piloted affairs of Abia State from 1999 to 2007, had in his post that went viral on social media on Monday, revealed that he paid a visit to the IPOB leader at the DSS detention facility.\n\nKalu, who is currently the Chief Whip of the Senate, in the said post, noted that he was the one that made Kanu\u2019s father, Eze Israel Okwu Kanu, the traditional ruler of Afara-Ukwu, Umuahia, in 2001 while he was in office as governor.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThis afternoon, I visited my brother, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, Abuja. I met him in good health and care, and we discussed him as \u2018Umunne\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn 2001 when I was Governor, I made his father Eze Israel Okwu Kanu, the traditional ruler of Afara-Ukwu, and since then, the family has been very close to me.\n\n\u201cI understand that Nnamdi has an insane amount of people rooting for him back home, and I encouraged him to consider the consequences of certain actions and utterances for the sake of the same people.\n\n\u201cEven though my ideology and his ideology are totally different, God has made us brothers and we can\u2019t run away from each other.\n\n\u201cI owe him and Nigerians good counselling, whether he and his family listen to me or not, I will continue counselling him as I have always done in the past. What we need most is a peaceful and secured society.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ejiofor, while kicking against the visit in his own statement titled \u201cUpdate on our visit to our noble client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu at the DSS Headquarters Abuja on November 29 2021\u201d, said it turned out to be a \u201cpolitical gimmicks\u201d.\n\nALSO READ: NDLEA secures conviction for 35 drug dealers in Akwa Ibom\n\nEjiofor said he has initiated a formal process towards ensuring a thorough investigation of Kalu\u2019s visit to his client.\n\n\u201cWe can at best describe what transpired yesterday between a visitor whom the detaining authority ostensibly aided to violate the court-ordered guideline for visiting our Client as bizarre and unusual.\n\n\u201cThe DSS is not oblivious of the terms of the court\u2019s guideline which they have consistently maintained in the past that it must be obeyed to the letter, and through which position they had denied many friends and Attorneys of our Client, access to him.\n\n\u201cHowever, caution was thrown to the wind yesterday and instead of insisting on this full compliance with the existing guideline, the DSS for reasons best known to them allowed a visitor access to our Client even before the time scheduled for the formal visit and without his lawyers being present during the visit.\n\n\u201cIt is of serious concern that the visit was conducted without strict adherence to the court-ordered guideline, but more condescending that the visit later became a subject of political gimmicks.\n\n\u201cIf we, Our Client\u2019s Attorneys, his flesh and blood brothers, and his wife will visit him in due compliance with the court-ordered guideline, how can the DSS authorize a visit from any other person in gross violation of this guideline? There is more to it than meets the eyes, which the DSS is now under a compelling duty to explain to us.\n\n\u201cGranted that his name appeared among the list submitted at the 11th hour alongside the names of the lawyers scheduled for the visit, but hurriedly proceeding to conduct the visit without us being present in line with the requirement of the guideline left us with many unanswered questions.\n\n\u201cWe have initiated a formal process towards ensuring a thorough investigation of what transpired yesterday, and we shall not hesitate to formally address the world on this subject if there is any attempt to sweep our petition under the carpet.\n\n\u201cThe Order of the court and terms as laid down guideline, to regulate visits to our Client is to ensure his maximum protection from persons who may wish to secretly seize the opportunity to hurt or intimidate him into accepting a false narrative outside the dungeon where he is being illegally detained, and they could achieve this through threats and/or coercion. Hence, the need for the presence of his lawyers before granting any audience.\n\n\u201cWe may not wish to speak further on this subject or even discuss our Client\u2019s position on this visit pending the outcome of investigation on the DSS authorized violation of the court-ordered guideline.\n\n\u201cIn as much as we have unequivocally demanded for an immediate investigation, we are not by any means insinuating that visitors of our Client\u2019s choice are not permitted or restrained from visiting him henceforth, but our position is that every visit to our Client must conform with the already set out guideline by the court.\n\n\u201cWe shall keep you all updated as we navigate through this turbulent path, but just note that victory and nothing less than victory is our goal, and it shall surely end in VICTORY UmuChineke.\n\n\u201cPlease note that our Client is profoundly grateful for your dexterity and peaceful conduct so far. This too will soon come to pass.\n\n\u201cContinue to pray ceaselessly and without season that we shall overcome, UmuChineke\u201d, Ejiofor\u2019s statement further read.\n\nIt will be recalled that trial Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja had ordered the DSS to allow the detained IPOB leader who is answering to a seven-count treasonable felony charge, access to three visitors of his choice, every Monday and Thursday of the week.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

This reality stares us in the face today.\n\nThe optimism of a bright future led by the youth of today and leaders of tomorrow is gradually fading away, thanks to the menace of drugs.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a national problem linked to all other criminal activities, but we do not consider it critical. A generation of people is gradually being wiped out. The implications of this are too dire even to contemplate.\n\nThere are two sides to the drug issue, and both sides complement each other \u2013 the supply and demand sides. Drug trafficking and drug abuse/addiction form parts of a vicious circle. One significantly correlates with the other.\n\nWhere there is a high level of drug abuse, there must always be a correspondingly high level of drug trafficking and vice versa. The psychology and economics of drugs in our society juxtapose synergically with our youths\u2019 crass criminality and wanton debasement. Let us tackle first the issue of drug trafficking.\n\nRegional drug trafficking intersects with many security issues ranging from war and terrorism to human trafficking and national stability. It brings along with it, myriad security issues and challenges, notably an intricate network of actors across various levels of handling narcotics management, which in most instances extend abroad.\n\nExternal manipulation by drug traffickers has resulted in a surge in maritime drug trafficking in Lagos and Nigeria\u2019s coastal regions and is wreaking havoc at the land borders of the North East and North West.\n\nThe emergence of new criminal avenues to launder drug money, such as cryptocurrency and money transfer systems, has exacerbated the menace of drug trafficking. Drug transactions seem seamless, and funds from illicit drug deals are laundered and allowed to filter into legitimate business environments.\n\nThe heightened insecurity and lack of employment in many states create opportunities for drug traffickers\u2019 relative smooth operations, apart from the occasional seizures.\n\nThe potential for the drug trade to become a source of violent political competition, instability and, most important, emerge as a parallel power that rivals the established legal system and political hierarchy becomes a frightful possibility.\n\nA cursory look at the media in Nigeria reveals that hardly any month passed in 2021 without any significant cases of vast amounts of drugs seized at the important gateways in Nigeria or a Nigerian caught abroad with a large consignment of drugs being smuggling into another country.\n\nThese seizures have shed light on how the work of trafficking networks is facilitated by a range of actors, including alleged business people, politicians, celebrities, and students.\n\nNigeria\u2019s porous borders, weak institutions, corrupt practices, political patronage, poverty, and ethnic identities, enable traffickers to avoid detection by the formal security apparatus.\n\nThere are even times when the conventional security apparatus itself provides cover for traffickers, giving rise to legitimate concerns about the ability of criminal networks and illicit drug monies to infiltrate security and government agencies, transform or influence the motivations of its members, reorient objectives towards the spoils of drug trafficking activity, thus undermining the democratic processes.\n\nStill on the supply side is the new availability of cheap opioids in the open market under different brand names. The demand side of the drug debacle follows the same trend.\n\nRecent data shows that about 14.3m Nigerians abuse drugs, which represents a 14.4 prevalence rate, three times the global prevalence rate of five per cent. Of the 14m people abusing drugs, 10.6m abuse cannabis Sativa, aka Indian hemp \u2013 the rest abuse various other hard drugs. The use of cocaine and heroin is gaining prominence, especially among youths from upper-middle-class or upper class or young and well to do professionals.\n\nMost of the poor people who abuse drugs either use Indian hemp or abuse pharmaceutical drugs like tramadol, cough syrups and the infamous mkpuru Miri trending across social media lately. There is the news of foreigners setting up factories in South-East Nigeria for the manufacture of mkpuru Miri.\n\nBrigadier-General Buba Marwa(rtd), Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency chief, in a different articles admitted that just like the rest of Africa, West African countries have been grappling with the problem of a dearth of credible data on the trend of drug use in the sub-region.\n\nHowever, available data shows that within the first 10 months of 2021, about 10,355 people were arrested for drug offences, 3.1m kg of assorted drugs valued at nearly N120bn were seized, with about 5579 people counselled and rehabilitated.\n\nThis statistics for 2021, although looking like a drop in the ocean compared to the type of statistics we expect to get with an intensified effort from relevant authorities to curb this drugs menace, is still a considerable improvement to the data from 2018 to 2020. All the three years combined are less than the 10 months figures for this year alone.\n\nThis report shows that the curve is bending on drug trafficking and abuse as more effort is made by this administration to improve the situation. I commend this renewed effort and hope it will continue to be sustained by the government.\n\nThe escalating drug consumption in the student community, in the streets of major cities, and the growing music and film world is indicative of the ever-increasing tentacles of the drug trade.\n\nAcross Nigeria, there has been an upsurge in drug consumption fueled by increasing stress and hopelessness among youth. Unemployment, lack of opportunities and descent into anarchy may be forcing youths into all forms of escape.\n\nThe upsurge has resulted in many Nigerians questioning the effectiveness and resilience of the existing legal and enforcement machinery. This escalation becomes worse closer to the general election period.\n\nThe politician-drug nexus is one of the factors responsible for the spread of the menace. It cuts across parties.\n\nThe reasons vary from desperation in looking for money to fund election, money laundering, facilitation of violence, political patronage to substance abuse by thugs.\n\nA trend has been established that as we approach every election cycle, there is always a three or four-fold jump in substances seized and the number of drug-related arrests spike. The link between drugs and politics is shameful, and every leader in Nigeria must openly work at completely eradicating drug abuse within his area of influence.\n\nApart from the apparent damage to society drug abuse causes, it has broader implications and far-reaching consequences to all. At the nuclear level is the devastation it causes to families.\n\nMost times, parents are the last to know that their children are dependent on hard drugs. It is easier to spot another person\u2019s child than yours in circumstances like this.\n\nDrug abuse is not far from most parents, just that they are not inquisitive enough to find out. Obviously, their children and wards are already \u2018junkies\u2019 and wholly hooked on drugs by the time it is obvious. This ordeal has a devastating effect on the family.\n\nOne of the main challenges lies in the fact that the predominant approach to drug trafficking in the region has been based on the international narcotics control regime, which focuses on stemming the supply of drugs through law enforcement efforts. Little emphasis has been placed on the health, developmental and spill-over effects of drug use and trafficking, which over time will constitute a more significant security threat to the nation. Health facilities in Nigeria are not geared to deal with the consequences of drug dependency.\n\nThere is a dearth of specialised units and medical professionals, and rehabilitation centres across the country.\n\nFurthermore, there is widespread concern that transnational organised crime, including illicit weapons and banditry, piracy and armed robbery at sea, kidnapping and terrorism, are increasingly linked with drug trafficking and abuse, pose a direct security threat to peace and stability in the Niger Delta region and main theatres of conflicts in the North East and North West.\n\nA severe threat posed by drug trafficking and abuse is their ability to reshape relational dynamics between and among political and security actors, the citizenry, and the business community within and beyond borders.\n\nThe infiltration and potential weakening of military, police, customs, and border agencies by criminal organizations can damage national security.\n\nThe threat of radicalisation and youth recruitment by Boko Haram, ISWAP and terrorist groups is another profound corollary of drug trafficking and abuse. Radicalisers and recruiters target vulnerable youths from higher institutions, villages, and gangs.\n\nMosques are a soft pool that is exploited easily, and fresh recruits, both male and female,are whisked off to join other militants and terrorists operating at the edges of Northern Nigeria or other foreign countries and in war zones. Another area of concern is that rivalries between different groups involved in the drug trade can lead to violent competition for access to routes, products, and profits.\n\nCross border security threats with their spill-over effects have impacted negatively on Nigeria\u2019s internal security.\n\nThe Federal Government has continued to mitigate these transnational security threats through bilateral and multilateral engagements. In addressing the above threats, the government has made concerted efforts by improving interoperability and synergy in the multi-agency approach.\n\nIt has deployed counterterrorism and counter-narcotics initiatives which led to the disruption of several high profile planned attacks.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, government has intensified efforts to tackle the problem of drug abuse and trafficking to stem the slipping slope to ignominy many youths who dabbled into drugs are heading to.\n\nHowever, I will implore that a robust counter-drug trafficking and abuse initiative be started immediately. A national strategy that will map out actions at federal, state, and local government levels is needed and must involve security agencies, civil societies, and ordinary citizens.\n\nMoreover, a national media sensitisation and mass mobilisation against drug abuse and trafficking must be carried out. Parents must be made aware of the dangers of drugs on their children so that they become more vigilant, monitoring online platforms, especially those used by drug peddlers to coordinate drug trafficking activities.\n\nCreate and implement robust anti-money laundering laws aimed at disrupting the financial flow of drug money. EFCC should use existing financial regulation laws to prosecute known drug dealers actively. Finally, the government must locate, disrupt, and destroy all forms of illicit drug trafficking whilst working hard to establish the infrastructure to tackle drug abuse.\n\nGovernment must confiscate all monetary proceeds of drug trafficking, and drug pushers punished by the law.\n\nThe time to act is now. NDLEA claims that over 40 per cent of Nigerian youths (between 18 and 35) are deeply involved in drug abuse. This new epidemic may cause more significant harm than the COVID-19 soon.\n\nThe prevalence of drug abuse in Nigeria and the negative impact on public health and safety necessitate that all hands be on deck to curtail the challenge. Schools, communities, voluntary organizations, and religious bodies should embark on drug abuse enlightenment, treatment and prevention. There is no better time than now for all relevant stakeholders to rise and join the crusade to make Nigeria a better and safer nation, especially for the youths \u2013 the leaders of tomorrow.",
          "summary": "Drug trafficking and drug abuse/addiction form parts of a vicious circle.\nWhere there is a high level of drug abuse, there must always be a correspondingly high level of drug trafficking and vice versa.\nOf the 14m people abusing drugs, 10.6m abuse cannabis Sativa, aka Indian hemp \u2013 the rest abuse various other hard drugs.\nMost of the poor people who abuse drugs either use Indian hemp or abuse pharmaceutical drugs like tramadol, cough syrups and the infamous mkpuru Miri trending across social media lately.\nGovernment must confiscate all monetary proceeds of drug trafficking, and drug pushers punished by the law.",

John Joseph Hayab in a statement, \u201cOn Monday, 29th November 2021, the Kaduna state government announced that it will commence transition to four-day working week for civil servants in the state.\n\n\u201cThe government, in justifying this seemingly innocuous decision, maintained that the policy is to \u201cboost productivity, improve work-life balance and enable workers to have more time for their families, for rest and for agriculture.\u201d\n\nRev.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied zoning its national chairmanship to North Central.\n\nSenator James Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the party\u2019s Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) said this when he spoke with newsmen in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nReacting to a media report, he said the issue of zoning was not part of the mandates of the Governor Buni-led CECPC.\n\n\u201cI have the mandate to report that whatever decision the CECPC takes, and to the best of my knowledge, the committee has not discussed zoning.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that with the party\u2019s national convention slated for February 2022, it was expected that party members would come up with different zoning speculations.\n\n\u201cPeople are just flying what will favour their interest; all I know is that the caretaker committee has not discussed or reached a zoning decision,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAlso Senator Victor Lar, media director, Senator Ali-Modu Sheriff Campaign Organisation, said the report was laughable and a figment of the imagination of those who planted it.\n\n\u201cWe find the purported story as very laughable because the organs of the party that are supposed to communicate that kind of information are not the ones communicating it. For that reason, we will take it with a pinch of salt. Again, the APC as a party has never adopted zoning, therefore, the story of it zoning the national championship to the North Central can better be described as a figment of the imaginations of those who planted it. We find the report as the very poor scheming of people who are scared of contesting the position with Sheriff,\u2019\u2019 Lar said.\n\nLar added that the race for the APC national chairmanship was an open contest, saying the best candidate should be allowed to emerge. He said this was necessary for the party to be galvanised for victory in the 2023 general elections.\n\nHowever, there appeared to be no letup in the internal crisis plaguing the party as its youth wing, yesterday, handed the Buni-led CECPC an ultimatum to pack and go.\n\n\u201cToday is the day that story of youths are leaders of tomorrow ended. Today, we are leaders of here and now and we will change Nigeria. We have been recognised by Mr. President and by all the members of the party. I can tell you that the leaders are currently scrambling and having meeting on how to align with us.\n\n\u201cThis Caretaker Committee has sacked the Buni-led caretaker committee and (it) stands dissolved, disbanded and no longer represent the APC members. As the new committee, we will take up the monumental task of reconciliation,\u201d the group under the aegis of the APC Progressive Youth Movement (APC-PYM) said.\n\nIt also inaugurated a caretaker committee to conduct the party\u2019s national convention in February next year.\n\nChairman of the APC-PYM Caretaker Committee, Mustapha Audu, who made the disclosure in Abuja, gave the party\u2019s national leadership January 3 ultimatum to vacate the national secretariat.\n\nHe said the group would not only write to the Buni-led committee next week to handover and vacate the national secretariat but would also write an audit firm to look into the accounts of the ruling party since the caretaker committee took over last year.\n\nBut the CECPC have dismissed the purported sack, insisting that it would not join issues with paid, misguided group.\n\nThe party, in a statement by the National Secretary, Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, denied knowledge of the existence of the group in the party even as it claimed its borders on treasonable felony.\n\n\u201cWe have received several enquiries from the media and concerned APC members on the felonious activities of a purported group parading themselves as Progressive Youth Movement.\n\n\u201cThe purported group and membership are unknown to the party, its structure or as a registered support group, hence we completely disown them and cannot account for their activities or join issues with them.\n\n\u201cHowever laughable, the criminal attempt of the purported group to usurp the leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC now borders on treasonable felony. Relevant security bodies must now check and address their unscrupulous activities.\n\n\u201cThe attention the purported group seeks will not be given to them by the party. We can only advise that the general public completely disregard them. Members of this group are not registered members of the APC and are being used by opposition elements and fifth columnists to cause confusion.\n\n\u201cAs widely reported, the successful meeting between the APC leadership, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and the president produced February 2022 as the timeframe for the party\u2019s national convention. Our focus now is preparing the ground for a rancour-free exercise,\u201d Akpanudoedehe.\n\nRegardless, APC-PYM said: \u201cIt is clear that there are issues in our great party and we all know that there are constitutional lacuna we are facing and the opposition is not happy with what is going on.\n\n\u201cThe composition of the sacked APC was in clear violation of the party and Nigeria\u2019s constitution but we have resolved that constitution lacuna and we are no longer unprepared for the 2023 general elections. To show you the power of young people, we met just a week ago in Kaduna and fixed our convention for February 2022 only for the governors to assemble in Abuja 24 hours after.\n\n\u201cThey went to the president claiming that he had agreed on the same February. We met with Mr. President in January and he told us to go all out and change the narrative.\n\n\u201cThere is enough problem existing already and majority of it came from the governors. In order to fix the problems as youths, we have to stand up bravely and boldly to face the challenges. We are going in to reconcile the APC hand-in-hand with party leaders and we are not going to chastise anybody.\u201d\n\nAsked where they would operate from after dissolving the Buni-led Committee, he said: \u201cWe will be writing formally to the Buni-led caretaker committee next week to tell them to vacant the office for us to occupy. We will also demand a handover note, we will also write to PricewaterhouseCoopers to do a thorough audit of the accounts of the APC since June last year when the Buni-led caretaker committee was inaugurated to establish the exact state of things,\u201d he said.\n\nAnnouncing the zoning of the national leadership to be contested on February 26, 2022, the group disclosed that the North would produce the national chairman, deputy national chairman would be zoned to the South while the deputy national chairman North would be a female. All the officials, except the chairman must be 45 years and below.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "\u2022 Promises $10bn investment in three years\n\n*Omicron variant outbreak: WHO bemoans poor alert system, says new pandemic accord needed\n\n\u2022Aviation agencies vigilant, await FG\u2019s directive\n\n\u2022NCDC harps on vaccination, adherence to protocols\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja,\n\nand Chinedu Eze in Lagos\n\nAs countries across the world continue to take measures to prevent the spread of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday said his country would offer another one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Nigeria and other African countries. Jinping also promised to encourage Chinese companies to invest at least $10 billion in the continent over the next three years.\n\nThe pledge of additional vaccine doses on top of the nearly 200 million that China had supplied to the continent came as concerns mounted over the spread of the new disease variant, which was detected in South Africa.\n\nThough, the Nigerian government said there was no reported case of the Omicron strain in the country. But Nigeria\u2019s aviation agencies said they were on alert to prevent the spread of the virus. That was as the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) urged Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to the proven public health and social measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nIn its own response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) yesterday said countries might have to reach a new agreement on ways to share information on pandemic outbreaks. WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said this in his opening remarks at the Special Session of the World Health Assembly. Ghebreyesus noted that the emergence of the Omicron variant underlined how perilous and precarious the situation could be.\n\nIn a speech given via video link at the opening of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Jinping said a China-Africa cross-border Yuan centre would be set up to provide African financial institutions a credit line of $10 billion. But he gave no further details.\n\nChina\u2019s total imports from Africa, one of its key sources of crude oil and mineral supply, would reach $300 billion in the next three years, the Chinese president said. He added that the two sides would cooperate in areas, such as health, digital innovation, trade promotion, and green development.\n\nThe Omicron variant of the coronavirus carries a very high global risk of surges, WHO warned on Monday, as more countries reported cases, prompting border closures and reviving worries about the economic recovery from a two-year pandemic.\n\nScientists have said it could take weeks to understand the severity of the new variant. Its emergence has caused a strong global reaction, with countries imposing travel curbs and other restrictions, worried that it could spread fast even in vaccinated populations.\n\nThe Chinese leader said his country would donate 600 million vaccine doses directly, while a further 400 million doses would come from other sources, such as investments in production sites.\n\nJinping\u2019s promise came as part of a forum between China and African states with a focus on trade and security, which was held in the city of Diamniadio, near Senegal\u2019s seaside capital, Dakar.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to fight together against COVID. We must prioritise the protection of our people and close the vaccination gap,\u201d Jinping told participants at the summit.\n\nVaccination rates in Africa are low compared with the rest of the world, with many countries at the mercy of foreign donations due to the lack of local production facilities and prohibitive costs of mass purchases.\n\nBeijing invests heavily in Africa, and is the continent\u2019s largest trading partner with direct trade worth more than $200 billion in 2019, according to the Chinese embassy in Dakar.\n\nMeanwhile, Ghebreyesus commended South Africa and Botswana for detecting, sequencing, and reporting the Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Omicron demonstrates just why the world needs a new accord on pandemics: our current system disincentisises countries from alerting others to threats that will inevitably land on their shores,\u201d the WHO director general said.\n\nGhebreyesus said COVID-19 had exposed and exacerbated fundamental weaknesses in the global architecture for pandemic preparedness and response. According to him, global health security is too important to be left to chance, goodwill, shifting geopolitical currents, or the vested interests of companies and shareholders\n\n\u201cThe best way we can address them is with a legally binding agreement between nations; an accord forged from the recognition that we have no future but a common future,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThen surely \u2013 surely \u2013 the time has come for countries to agree on a common, binding approach to a common threat that we cannot fully control nor prevent \u2013 a threat that comes from our relationship with nature itself,\u201d he added.\n\nWHO warned its 194 member-nations that any surge in infections could have \u201csevere consequences\u201d, but said no deaths linked to the Omicron variant had been reported so far.\n\nGhebreyesus said Omicron\u2019s emergence showed how \u201cperilous and precarious\u201d the situation was and called on health ministers meeting in Geneva to pursue a new accord on pandemics.\n\nOmicron COVID-19: Aviation Agencies on Alert, Await FG\u2019s Directive\n\nDespite announcing solidarity with South Africa over its travails following discovery of the Omicron COVID-19 variant in that country, Nigeria\u2019s aviation authorities said they were on alert to prevent the spread of the virus. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) disclosed yesterday that it was awaiting further directives from the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) to know the next action to take in the effort to prevent the new virus from coming to Nigeria.\n\nSpokesman of NCAA, Sam Adurogboye, said all measures and directives usually came from the committee, which directed NCAA on what to enforce.\n\nAdurogboye said, \u201cWe are waiting for the Presidential Steering Committee to issue directives on ways to prevent the spread of the new variant to Nigeria. NCAA can only enforce the federal government directives.\u201d\n\nGeneral Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, told THISDAY that while waiting for the directives from the Presidential Steering Committee, every FAAN official at the international airports had been kept on high alert.\n\nYakubu said the agencies and Port Health officials had been given clear orders to ensure no passengers from the affected countries entered the country unscreened.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe are waiting for directive from the steering committee, but there have been a serious reinforcement at Port Health. All the airport managers are on high alert because this is a dangerous variant, which is deadly.\n\n\u201cThere will be an enforcement of all the protocols and procedures put in place for the COVID-19 already on ground. All the agencies concerned and Port Health, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, FAAN and others have all been put on notice to ensure no passenger comes into the country with this variant.\u201d\n\nNCDC Urges Nigerians to Vaccinate, Observe Protocols\n\nIn a related development, the Federal Ministry of Health and the NCDC urged Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to the public health and social measures put in place in view of the new COVID-19 variant.\n\nHowever, the disease control centre said the variant has so far not been detected in the country.\n\nIn a statement issued by NCDC Director General, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, the centre said, \u201cWe are aware of reports of a new COVID-19 variant \u2013 the B.1.1.529 lineage. This SARS-CoV-2 variant has now been designated a variant of concern (VOC) and named Omicron by WHO as advised by the independent Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).\u201d\n\nConsidering the likelihood of increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant and its linkage to unmitigated community transmission, NCDC urged Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to the proven public health and social measures in place. The measures are enforced by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC-COVID-19), through the COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations 2021.\n\nThe NCDC boss said in order to reduce the risk of importation or spread of the Omicron variant in Nigeria, Nigerians should make use of the current opportunities to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHe urged strict adherence to the public health and social measures, which include wearing of facemasks, especially in crowded settings, washing of hands regularly, physical distancing, and good ventilation.\n\nOthers are avoiding travel to countries where there is a surge in COVID-19 cases or reported cases of the Omicron variant and avoiding all non-essential travels, both local and international.\n\nThe centre said the virus was more likely to spread where people gathered without adhering to these measures. It appealed to business owners, religious leaders, and people in authority to take responsibility by ensuring people in their premises wore facemasks and adhered to physical distancing.\n\n\u201cIf you must travel, please, adhere to travel protocols instituted by the PSC-COVID-19, which are in place to prevent the risk of importation of the virus or its variants to Nigeria,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement said WHO had also urged countries to enhance their surveillance and virus sequencing efforts to increase their understanding of the circulating variants.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Health and NCDC said they were monitoring emerging evidence on the new variant and its implication.\n\nCanada on Sunday said it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain of COVID-19 in two persons who arrived the country from Nigeria. But the federal government stated that the new variant had not yet been reported not in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, industry stakeholders observed that no airline flew directly from Nigeria to any destination in Canada. Therefore, it was expected that Canada would give details of where the two Nigerians connected their flight from after leaving Nigeria, and whether they spent some days in the country from where they connected heir flight to Canada.\n\nAfter South Africa announced the discovery of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, to the World Health Organisation (WHO), some countries banned flights from the African country.

          "text": "\u2022To issue travel guideline today\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nAs countries across the world continued to take measures to prevent the spread of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, Nigeria yesterday said there was currently no reported detection of the strain in the country.\n\nNational COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr. Mukhtar Muhammad, stated this position yesterday in Abuja at a media briefing organised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19.\n\nAddressing journalists, Muhammad stressed that as of yesterday, there had not been any detected case, saying, \u201cthe PSC has continued to review our risk of this latest information and take every necessary step to stop it from being imported into the country. We have taken far-reaching proactive measures to minimise and mitigate this possibility.\u201d\n\nThe discovery last week by South Africa and Botswana of the more infectious variant of COVID-19 elicited global concern.\n\nMuhammad said PSC would be issuing a travel guideline today to prevent the virus from spreading. The new travel guideline will require passengers arriving the country to do a PCR test 48 hours before departing.\n\nThey would also do day two and day seven PCR tests on arrival while they will be required to self-isolate for seven days, he added.\n\nMuhammad explained: \u201cPassengers that are outbound, going out of Nigeria, will be required to either show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or provide a negative PCR test taken 48 hours before departure. These conditions apply to diplomats as well. The measures will come into effect by Friday, 3rd of December, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe Head of Technical Secretariat of PSC said the authority would ensure that there was enforcement on passengers who arrived and refused to take tests, through suspension of their passports and prosecution, or both.\n\nHe added that PSC would step up surveillance at the ports of entry into the country, intensify testing and contact tracing, and optimise sequencing capacity.\n\nMuhammad decried the promotion of vaccine nationalism, a pervasive inequality at the global level that made rich countries to be able to procure vaccines for their own citizens, through direct agreements with pharmaceutical companies, while low and middle countries lagged behind. He said this was one of the factors fuelling COVID-19 and the emergence of variants of concern, including Omicron.\n\nHe warned that lack of vaccination in developing countries would provide a fertile ground for the virus to develop mutations, which will in turn threaten progress already recorded. Muhammad called on the developed countries to support efforts being made globally to ensure that there was equity and access to vaccines.\n\nThe federal government also said it was reviewing the situation around the world and putting in place measures to curtail the effect of the new variant on the country.\n\nSpeaking at the national briefing of the committee, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, PSC on COVID-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha, urged Nigerians to exercise extra caution and vigilance in practice and enforcement of preventive measures.\n\nMustapha stated, \u201cAs the DG WHO has just stated today, the emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is. South Africa and Botswana should be thanked for detecting, sequencing and reporting this variant, not penalised.\u201d\n\nHe said both South Africa and Botswana should be commended for not hiding Omicron but revealing to WHO the outcome of their sequencing.\n\nMustapha warned that other countries might in future choose to maintain silence, in the process putting the world at risk, instead of disclosing discovery of new outbreaks in order not to suffer liabilities, like the ones South Africa and Botswana are suffering.\n\nThe SGF said PSC was aware of some travellers circumventing the travel protocols by providing fake COVID-19 test results, vowing, \u201cThe weight of the law is heavy and will come hard on these people.\u201d\n\nMustapha said under the Vaccine Mandate that would come into effect fully on December 1, 2021, every federal government worker and, in essence, all Nigerians and residents were expected to get vaccination.\n\nHe added: \u201cWith the developments around the world, people will not be able to travel without their verified vaccination cards.\u201d\n\nThe SGF also said the impasse on the Nigeria-UAE flights had been resolved in the interest of both parties. He said though this process had taken so long to pull through, with its ripple effects, everyone involved in getting the deal deserved plaudits.\n\n\u201cA date for the commencement of flights between the two countries will be announced in due course,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SGF also said PSC\u2019s nine months mandate extension would end on December 31. He said to effectively capture the core elements of the national response, a National Summit to end COVID-19 in 2022 and to strengthen Global Health Security was being planned to hold in Abuja 6-7 December.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*AfDB president says Africa should not be penalised for new strain\n\n*Wants vaccine manufacturing accelerated in continent\n\n*Emefiele, OPS seek proactive action Ramaphosa urges countries to reverse travel ban\n\nObinna Chima and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nNigeria yesterday expressed solidarity with South Africa as it struggled with some of the difficulties posed by a new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, discovered in the country. The Nigerian government warned Western countries against discrimination against South Africa following travel restrictions imposed on Southern African countries in the aftermath of the new virus discovery.\n\nThe federal government said President Muhammadu Buhari would go ahead to receive South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had been scheduled to visit Nigeria from today with other top officials of his administration, on a three-day visit.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, stated Nigeria\u2019s position in a chat with THISDAY ahead of a media briefing scheduled for today in Abuja on the matter.\n\nRamaphosa called for reversal of the travels restriction.\n\nIn a similar vein, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, yesterday voiced displeasure at the stigmatisation and penalisation of Africa for new COVID-19 variants discovered on the continent. Adesina urged the acceleration of vaccine production in Africa.\n\nLikewise, some members of the organised private sector (OPS) advised the federal and state governments in Nigeria to take proactive steps to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The OPS members said this during separate interviews with THISDAY.\n\nThat was as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said at the weekend in Lagos that the dire implications of the food export restrictions by some countries during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 should not be lost on Nigeria.\n\nEhanire insisted that the move by Western countries to ban or try to isolate South Africa was discriminatory. He this was because the variant detected in South Africa and also in Botswana and other countries had similarly been detected in Belgium, Italy, Germany and other countries.\n\n\u201cSo, the federal government condemned the rush to ban or isolate South Africa by European countries, without isolating Belgium, Italy and other European countries that have more direct flights into the United States of America and among themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister argued that the position of the Western countries on the virus was not backed by science, saying so far, even if it is a mutation, the new COVID-19 variant has not caused any new deaths or proved to be worse than the Delta variant.\n\nEhanire stated, \u201cTherefore, the world should wait for that time, than to be enmeshed in heavy discrimination against South Africa. Why would they isolate South Africa? The federal government would open its doors to Ramaphosa and others who are coming from South Africa until science says otherwise. People should be vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB president, who wrote on his Twitter handle, stressed that Africa was not the source of the COVID-19 virus, which had continued to put the world on edge.\n\nThe new COVID-19 variant was first discovered in South Africa and has since been detected in Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong.\n\nOwing to its discovery, Israel on Saturday announced that it was banning all foreigners from entering the country. The ban, pending government approval, was expected to last two weeks. Israelis returning from countries on the red list, which included countries in Southern Africa, would be required to isolate for seven days in a designated hotel.\n\nAustralia also banned the entry of foreigners who had travelled to nine Southern African countries in the past 14 days, including South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Korea, too, imposed restrictions on travellers from eight southern African countries, its Disease Control and Prevention Agency announced Saturday.\n\nForeign nationals traveling from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi and Mozambique were banned from entering South Korea, the agency said.\n\nBut Adesina warned, \u201cAfrica should not be labelled and penalised for COVID-19 variants and mutations that occur randomly elsewhere in the world. Africa is not the source of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere must be global justice, equity and fairness in access to vaccine. Global vaccine supply system has underserved Africa. Protecting one\u2019s home alone in the midst of a forest does not work.\n\nPut out the forest fire.\n\n\u201cAfrica must accelerate the manufacturing of its own vaccines and set up its own \u2018healthcare security defence system\u2019. Africa must no longer outsource health security of its 1.8 billion people to the benevolence of others.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated the need for Nigerians to look inwards, considering the country\u2019s huge population. He said the pandemic presented an opportunity to fix critical infrastructure in the country so as to reduce dependence on other countries for most of the continent\u2019s needs.\n\nThe CBN governor stated, \u201cAs I\u2019ve asked in some of my recent treatises on the opportunities of the pandemic, what if the pandemic occurs again and we witness an extended restriction in movements and export bans? What if these restrictions become a new normal? What if another pandemic occurs in which all borders are closed, with food and medical imports significantly curtailed? What if the rich among us, even when they can afford to pay for their medical bills abroad, cannot travel out of our shores because of these extended lockdowns?\n\n\u201cAre we going to allow our hospitals to remain in their current state without equipment and state of the art facilities? For how long shall we continue to rely on the world for anything and everything?\u201d\n\nHe noted that in 2020, following the provision of vaccines, countries began to ease movement restrictions and demand in certain sectors began to recover to pre-COVID levels. Unfortunately, the surge in demand for the vaccines contributed to significant supply chain disruptions, which contributed to elevated inflation in advanced and developing markets, Emefiele added.\n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, in October 2021, stood at its highest level since July 2011, because of the initially exogenous supply disruption I am about to describe.\n\n\u201cFinally, tragic as these outcomes were, even more alarming was the reaction of many countries at the height of the pandemic. All over the world, countries responded by fighting for themselves and taking measures to protect their own people, regardless of the spill-over effects on the rest of the world. According to the World Customs organisation, a total of 32 countries and territories adopted stringent and immediate export restrictions on critical medical supplies and drugs that were specifically meant to respond to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) urged the federal and state governments to be vigilant in testing people arriving Nigeria in order to track and contain the spread of Omicron in the country.\n\nDirector General of the NACCIMA, Mr. Ayo Olukanni, told THISDAY yesterday that government should not let their guards down but pay attention to the possibility of the spread of the new variant in the country.\n\nOlukanni advised government at all levels to encourage Nigerians that had not taken the COVID-19 vaccines to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe should not let our guards down on this issue. Implicitly, there will be more testing and, of course, those people who have not taken the COVID-19 vaccine should be encouraged to take it now. In fact, this is the time to make it compulsory for everyone to have the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe should also be more stringent with people who are coming in from Omicron\u2019s high risk areas.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said government should not contemplate locking down the economy because of the new variant.\n\nOlukanni said, \u201cNo! I do not think that a lockdown will achieve any purpose. Our economy is just coming out of recession and we should not take actions that would push it back to another round of recession.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said the government should be vigilant and proactive in managing the spread of the new variant in the country. Yusuf, the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also told THISDAY that the government should apply a risk-based approach by tracing arrivals into Nigeria from high-risk locations. He also advised against another lockdown of the economy.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWhat the government should do is to trace the locations that represent high risk of importing the new variant into Nigeria and restrict entries from those locations for now.\n\n\u201cConsidering that Nigerians in those countries will be coming home and no one can say that they will not come home. But government has to isolate people from high-risk areas because I learnt that the new variant spreads very fast. So we need to be proactive.\n\n\u201cWhat I have in mind is that when people come in, they have to quarantine them for some time, especially those coming from high-risk areas. It has to be risk-based approach.\n\n\u201cBut, I do not foresee another lockdown of the economy.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa Urges Countries to Reverse Travel Ban\n\nMeanwhile, Ramaphosa has called on countries to \u201curgently\u201d reverse \u201cscientifically unjustified\u201d travel bans linked to the discovery of the Omicron.\n\nThe South African president was quoted as saying in his first address to the nation following the detection of the new variant, \u201cWe call upon all those countries that have imposed travel bans on our country and our southern African sister countries to immediately and urgently reverse their decisions.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition of travel is not informed by science.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said his country should expect a fourth wave of coronavirus infections in the wake of the discovery of the omicron variant.\n\nBut he said authorities would not be considering economic lockdown restrictions for the time being.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said it was not yet clear if Omicron caused more severe diseases.\n\n\u201cPreliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalisation in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron.\u201d\n\nThe head of WHO in Africa also urged countries to follow the science rather than imposing flight bans in a bid to contain the new Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cWith the Omicron variant now detected in several regions of the world, putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity,\u201d said WHO\u2019s regional director general Matshidiso Moeti.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NDIC to Adopt Risk-based Approach in Determining Banks\u2019 Premium",
          "text": "*Says in event of banks\u2019 failure, 97% depositors would be covered\n\nUgo Aliogo\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) said it was reviewing its approach for determining the premium by banks to its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), with a view to adopting a risk-based approach.\n\nManaging Director of NDIC, Mr. Bello Hassan, disclosed this in a keynote address he delivered at the 2021 Editors\u2019 Forum, with the theme, \u201cEnduring Extreme Disruptions: Resilience and Reinvention for Banking System Stability and Deposit Insurance,\u201d organised by the corporation in Lagos at the weekend.\n\nThe NDIC, in calculating premiums from deposit money banks, usually chose between adopting a flat-rate premium or a system that sought to differentiate premiums on the basis of individual-bank risk profiles.\n\nA flat-rate premium system has the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and administer. Also, it allows the strong banks to subsidise the weak ones for the stability of the financial system.\n\nHowever, it does not take into account the level of risk that a bank poses to the deposit insurance system, and can, therefore, be perceived as unfair, in that the same premium rate is charged to all banks, regardless of their degrees of risk.\n\nHassan explained NDIC had commenced the review of its approach \u201cto the determination of premium/contribution by banks to our DIF to a more risk-based approach to ensure that, the probability of the risk crystallising becomes a major factor in the pricing methodology of our premium going forward.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOn timely support to insured institutions, we have identified the need to reconsider our criteria for qualification of financial institutions to provide realistic terms and conditions in order to facilitate prompt access to technical and/or financial support in line with the Sec\n\n(2)(1)(b) of the NDIC Act whilst also protecting the corporation from possible downside risk.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that the corporation had commenced the process of strengthening its failure resolution and liquidation mandate through the improvement of its internal processes and procedures as well as enhancing effective collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that it discharges its responsibilities more efficiently.\n\nHe said the review became imperative given the need to implement prompt corrective actions on ailing or failed banks, improve processes in addressing challenges in liquidation and, most importantly, provide timely reimbursement of insured sums to depositors of failed banks.\n\nIn the area of deposit insurance as a distinct mandate of the corporation, the NDIC boss pointed out that from statistics, the corporation\u2019s deposit insurance coverage limits were not only adequate but also robust enough to engender confidence in the banking system.\n\nFor instance, in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the total number of accounts in the deposit money banks stood at 83 million; 99.1million; 112 million and 128.4 million respectively.\n\nHe added, \u201cOut of these numbers, the N500,000 coverage limit fully covered 99.4 per cent; 97.6 per cent; 97.5 per cent and 97.6 per cent of accounts, respectively. The implication is that in the event of bank failure, above 97 per cent of depositors would be fully covered by the corporation.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that pursuant to the provisions of the NDIC Act, several failure resolution initiatives, such as Open Bank Assistance (OBA), Purchase & Assumption (P&A), and Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) had been adopted in resolving distress in various banks from 1989, culminating in the novel bridge bank option to resolve four problem banks in 2011 and 2018.\n\nThe bridge bank option, according to him, did not only prevent a systemic crisis, it secured N1.021 trillion deposits which ensured that depositors had continued access to their funds and financial services. The implementation of the bridge bank option also saved over 12,667 jobs while over 877 branch network and services of the affected banks were maintained.\n\nHassan said, \u201cThe corporation\u2019s accomplishment in the payment of guaranteed sums and liquidation dividends speaks volumes for its commitment to the discharge of its unique mandate. NDIC had paid a cumulative sum of N8.268 billion to 443,946 insured depositors and N100.080 billion to uninsured depositors of deposit money banks in-liquidation as at September 30th, 2021, while N3.413 billion was paid to 90,945 insured depositors of microfinance banks and N1.218 million to uninsured depositors. In the same vein, cumulative insured amount paid to 1,553 depositors of closed primary mortgage banks as at 30th September, 2021 stood at N110.15 million while N7.965 million was paid as uninsured deposits.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the payment of N1.274 billion to 991 creditors and N4.886 billion to 965 shareholders of banks in-liquidation as at September 30, 2021 underscored the corporation\u2019s success story in bank liquidation. What this implies is that the corporation had realised enough assets to pay all the insured and uninsured depositors of the banks that present themselves for payment.\n\nCurrently, 19 out of the 49 DMBs in-liquidation fall into this category.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "*Says in event of banks\u2019 failure, 97% depositors would be coveredUgo AliogoThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) said it was reviewing its approach for determining the premium by banks to its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), with a view to adopting a risk-based approach.\nThe NDIC, in calculating premiums from deposit money banks, usually chose between adopting a flat-rate premium or a system that sought to differentiate premiums on the basis of individual-bank risk profiles.\nA flat-rate premium system has the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and administer.\nAlso, it allows the strong banks to subsidise the weak ones for the stability of the financial system.\nFor instance, in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the total number of accounts in the deposit money banks stood at 83 million; 99.1million; 112 million and 128.4 million respectively.",

Muda Ogunsola, Dr. Gbenga Adeyeye and Mr. Maxwell Adeleye.\n\nIn the statement, Adeyemi noted that Prof Akintoye was based on the fact that NINAS did not want to align with some of the principles of self-determination that the Yoruba people desire.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cThe Chairman of the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), Professor Banji Akintoye, has left his chairmanship role in the organisation with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cAlso, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups, has moved out of the NINAS Alliance with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cNINAS was the umbrella body of Self-Determination Groups in the South and Middle-Belt Regions of Nigeria with Ilana Omo Oodua representing the Yoruba bloc, Lower Niger Congress (LNC) representing the South East and South-South, and the Middle-Belt Rennaissance Movement representing the Middle-Belt Region.\u201d\n\nIt further stated that, \u201cAkintoye and 44 other leaders of IOO said it is very imperative, sacrosanct and germane for the Yoruba bloc to quit the Alliance in order to preserve the integrity and reputation of the Yoruba Nation agitation for Self-Determination.\u201d\n\n\"In the light of the current development in the Yoruba Self-Determination struggle, especially, in Ilana Omo Oodua, it has become very necessary for the Yoruba people to dissociate themselves from the Alliance known as NINAS with immediate effect.\n\n\"It is our well-considered opinion that some of those we align within NINAS do not want the kind of SELF-DETERMINATION that we the Yoruba people want.\n\n\"Therefore, we the leadership of Ilana Omo Oodua, wish to inform the general public that the Yoruba Bloc under the leadership of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide has moved out of the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS) with immediate effect in order to safeguard the integrity and honour of our agitation for Self-Determination.\n\n\"We thank the Leader of LNC, Mr. Tony Nnadi, for his inputs to the NINAS struggle since inception. However, it is now obvious to most people in the Yoruba Self-Determination struggle that the LNC is not working in tandem with our objective in Ilana Omo Oodua.\n\n\"The implication of this development is that the prestigious leadership that Professor Adebanji Stephen Akintoye, has provided for NINAS as Chairman since inception has now come to an end from today Tuesday 30th November, 2021.\n\n\"Furthermore, Ilana Omo Oodua hereby withdraws its membership of NINAS with immediate effect. All the Yoruba people worldwide that believe in the agitation for Yoruba Nation self-determination at home and abroad are, by this statement, notified to comply.\n\n\"We are, however, pleased to inform you that a more productive wide-alliance to be known as the South and Middle-Belt People's Sovereign Movement (SOMPSOM) will be officially inaugurated after the completion of the ongoing consultations with like minds across the South and Middle-Belt regions.\u201d",

          "title": "Are Ugandan telcos equipped to protect user data?",
          "text": "A recent report from Unwanted Witness, a Uganda-based civil society organisation, reveals that two years on from the implementation of Uganda\u2019s Data Protection and Privacy Act, the nation\u2019s tech companies are still struggling with compliance.\n\nTelecommunication operators are at the core of Uganda\u2019s digital development, and yet are among the worst offenders on privacy violations, raising questions about their ability to protect sensitive user data.\n\nLaw in action\n\nUganda implemented its first codified legislation on data protection, the Data Protection, and Privacy Act, in 2019. The act, which establishes principles surrounding the protection, collection, and storage of customers\u2019 personal data, designates the National Information Technology Authority \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) as the official regulator for data protection in the country and lays out penalties for violators.\n\nSince its implementation, Uganda\u2019s core data privacy act has proven to be an effective regulator, to some extent.\n\nIn 2020, Unwanted Witness investigated motorcycle ride-hailing startup Safeboda\u2019s compliance with data privacy regulations in the country. Their findings revealed that the company was not only guilty of using a privacy policy that did not comply with Uganda\u2019s data protection standards but also using a third-party tracker called CleverTap. When asked about its use of CleverTap, Safeboda\u2019s Chief Financial Officer claimed it was for \u201ctracking marketing communication and identifying product issues\u201d.\n\nThough no punitive measures were taken against Safeboda, the NITA-U did publish a report on its own investigation into the company\u2019s practices in early 2021. The regulator concluded that Safeboda was, in fact, in violation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and ordered the company to address \u201call areas of non-compliance\u201d over a four-month period.\n\nTelecom offenders\n\nWhile the work of Unwanted Witness and Uganda\u2019s Data Privacy Act helped stop some of Safeboda\u2019s practices, Uganda\u2019s telecommunication operators are still among the worst offenders.\n\nThe Privacy Scorecard Report 2021 revealed that telecom operators in Uganda failed to give adequate information to data subjects, mention third-party sharing of personal data, and give information on the quantity of information shared.\n\nThis resulted in a low overall score of 35% for the industry when it came to data compliance.\n\nThese digital failures have real-life consequences.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Mukasa, CEO at Unwanted Witness, \u201cTelecom companies are the highest data collectors [in Uganda]\u201d, and they are still struggling to ensure that they protect individuals.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly dangerous in an environment where telecom companies occupy a fundamental position in a nation\u2019s economy and tech industry.\n\nThe number of mobile subscribers in Uganda is rapidly on the rise, increasing by 21,200% from 2000\u20132020. As mobile subscriptions have grown, telcos in Uganda have also received new access to personal information from Ugandan citizens.\n\nIn 2018, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) issued new SIM card validation guidelines that required telcos to verify a registered mobile number against a citizen\u2019s National Identification Number (NIN). The regulation was meant to tackle fraud and crime, but, in the hands of telcos with suboptimal data privacy frameworks, it offered new capabilities for exploitation.\n\nHacking\n\nSince the onset of COVID-19, the use of mobile money\u2014of which MTN and Airtel Uganda maintain a 90% share of the market\u2014has increased by around 12.7%.\n\nAlongside this jump in users has also been more frequent instances of cyber fraud aimed at telecom companies, revealing just how essential proper data management and protection is.\n\nA 2019 Uganda Police Annual Crime Report revealed a 25% increase in cybercrime over a one-year period, leading to a loss of around $11 million from SIM card swapping and hacking digital financial accounts.\n\nIn 2020, MTN and Airtel Uganda were forced to temporarily suspend mobile money operations after their systems were compromised by hackers. Unconfirmed reports estimate that billions of Ugandan shillings were lost in the breach.\n\nWhy tech offends\n\nBeyond the value that an application garners from its products and services is the data it collects. Generally, a tech company, in its early stages, is not profitable in the traditional sense. At this point, its value is, in part, based on the data the company has access to through its user base.\n\nOften, as in the case of Safeboda, tech companies add trackers and third-party software on top of their applications to process the data they collect. Updating users each and every time a company adds a new tracker and explaining exactly what that tracker does can be bad for business.\n\nWhen Apple rolled out a new update allowing customers to opt-out of data trackers used by social media platforms earlier this year, digital citizens leaped at the opportunity, resulting in an estimated loss of $9.85 billion in revenue by Snap, Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s case, the tech companies that operate there gather data on a traditionally underserved tech market where there is \u201clow awareness of the power that they have to change and control their personal data,\u201d according to Mukasa.\n\nThis leaves Uganda\u2019s digital citizens vulnerable to unscrupulous tech companies who \u201care exploiting the low levels of awareness among the population to be able to collect as much as they can,\u201d said Mukasa.\n\nCountries around the world whose tech industries developed faster than regulation could keep up with had to learn hard lessons about digital privacy.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) has embarked on a year-long campaign to rein in powerful tech companies the government feels have had unchecked access to user data for far too long.\n\nFacebook has also been in and out of courts in the US and UK over data privacy issues, since 2018.\n\nAs Uganda\u2019s tech industry continues to develop, it too will have to contend with the benefits and costs of tech development.\n\nWhile this is going on, monitoring and evaluation by independent, civil society organisations like Unwanted Witness will become more important than ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Busha, a Nigeria-based digital platform that helps people buy, sell and store cryptocurrency, has raised seed funding of $4.2 million in a round led by Jump Capital.\n\nCadenza Ventures, Blockwall Capital, CMT Digital, Greenhouse Capital, Raba Capital, and other investors also participated in the financing round.\n\nAccording to the company, the new funding will go towards deepening its market positioning in Nigeria, the leading crypto economy in Africa where all of its users are based.\n\nFounded in 2018 by CEO Michael Adeyeri and Chief Product Officer (CPO) Moyo Sodipo, the cryptocurrency exchange claims to have more than 200,000 users and holds an ambition to \u201conboard the next set of one million Africans\u201d into the crypto economy.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the real difference in financial freedom crypto can make in the lives of our users, and we\u2019re very motivated to extend this to more people on the continent,\u201d Adeyeri said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBusha is currently working on an expansion into other countries across West Africa and will roll out when its 30-person team is comfortable they can both protect the users there and support any compliance efforts by the authorities, Sodipo told TechCabal via email.\n\n\u201cThe full West African corridor has our immediate attention, and we\u2019re also excited about East Africa, particularly Kenya and Uganda. We\u2019re currently prospecting those regions for opportunities to expand safely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup recently launched a revamped version of its app that allows users to buy crypto for less than $1 (\u20a6550) while offering features such as one-click limit orders and automated recurring buys.\n\nIt intends to launch a savings feature that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto next month and early next year, another for users to spend cryptocurrencies at select online and offline retail outlets. The latter is being developed in partnership with SureGifts, a gift card company.\n\nThe Busha team.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He believes it was finally time for him to leave for three reasons \u2014 he has the perfect replacement, has gotten Bret Taylor to become board chair, and finally to pass a message to the Twitter team that every one of them has the potential to lead.\n\nHowever, there are claims that the resignation was necessary as he could no longer continue to head Twitter along with his digital payments company, Square, due to criticisms \u2014 or concerns \u2014 that he might not perform optimally from some stakeholders.\n\nInterestingly, Jack has been running Square since 2009, after he was deemed unfit by stakeholders in 2008 and forced out of the Twitter CEO role. Fast forward to 2015; it was a unanimous decision from investors of both Twitter and Square to make him a permanent CEO.\n\nLong time coming? There have always been suggestions that he might be forced to leave one of the companies for another.\n\nFun fact: Based on 2020 values, Jack owns 2% of Twitter, making up $849M of his $12,3B total net worth.\n\nAway from Jack, there\u2019s a kind of excitement that came with this announcement. Parag is yet another top executive of Indian descent (the youngest on the list) leading a global tech company. A few mentions include Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, IBM\u2019s Arvind Krishna, Adobe\u2019s Shantanu Narayen, and Ajaypal Singh Banga of Mastercard.\n\nAnother fun fact: Parag Agrawal was among 4 Twitter executives who visited Nigeria with Jack Dorsey in 2019. An alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and Stanford University, Parag was instrumental in Twitter\u2019s foray into AI and Machine Learning.

It is one of the many innovations in the blockchain space that only enthusiasts and experts can easily take advantage of.\n\nWhile the news about NFT sales worth millions of dollars keeps making the rounds on social media, many of us still do not know what NFTs are.\n\nIn the simplest form, NFTs are just like a digital certificate of ownership. But why are they worth so much, and how does one create them?\n\nTo find out, look out for Bolu Abiodun\u2019s article on how to get started with NFTs later today.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nAre Ugandan telcos equipped to protect user data?

Warning, there might be a little Wild West reference; I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nLast week, we decided to talk with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO, to get their opinions on what the next frontier for the fintech industry would look like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst prediction: more regulations.\n\nSecond prediction: disruptive business models.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag too soon, so if you want to know more, you can find other predictions here: The next frontier for fintech: Disruptive business models.\n\nSabi raises $6 million bridge round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nSector-agnostic B2B platform, Sabi has announced the raise of a $6 million bridge round led by pan-African VC firm, CRE Venture Capital, with participation from others, including Janngo Capital, Atlantica Ventures, and Waarde Capital\n\nThe company, a spin-off from power-as-a-service startup, Rensource, came out of stealth in March 2021, after several months of building beginning in October 2020.\n\nThis is Sabi\u2019s second raise, after a seed round secured in August 2021, which saw participation from the same crop of investors in the current round.\n\nFounded by Anu Adasolum and Ademola Adesina, Sabi helps connect merchants \u2014 read manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers \u2014 bringing them access to a larger marketplace and enabling them with other helpful products like loans and inventory management.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, the company has set up shop in Kenya and made a few hires in South Africa and hopes to conclude a Series A raise in time to fund these expansions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bridge round is to be used to support its growth in Nigeria and beyond, a trend that has seen Sabi onboard more than 150,000 merchants and claim an almost $12 million GMV.\n\nAfrica\u2019s informal trade sector contributes around 50% of economic output and 85% of employment. And with companies like MaxAB, Sokowatch, and Sabi playing in the space, it does look like one to watch.\n\nNigeria\u2019s cooking gas woes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are like me and have contemplated using firewood as an alternative to cooking gas in the last few weeks, then some of these statistics might not surprise you.\n\nIn October 2021, the average price of 12.5kg cooking gas in Nigeria increased by 62.76% compared to October 2020. Between August 2021 and October 2021, the price increased by 47%.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, Oyo State has the highest average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021.\n\nThe graph above shows the increase in the price of cooking gas since November 2019.\n\nTo see the top ten states by average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021, kindly follow this link.\n\nThis is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here\n\nAfrica-focused Sanicle raises $160k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanicle\u2019s website\n\nLast week, women-focused startup, Sanicle (Padbanque) received an impact investment of $160,000 from Platform Capital,\n\nCo-founded by Chaste Inegbedion (Chief Period Officer), Roxanne Stewart (CEO), and Sage Oni (CTO), Sanicle officially launched in January 2021 with a plan to demystify periods by promoting period literacy while destigmatising women in menstruation.\n\nIts primary offerings, however, include a period box, a book, and a board game called Period Genie. The Period Box, which contains period essentials, and the book (Period Passport) authored by one of the co-founders are available on the business\u2019 eCommerce platform, sanicle.shop.\n\nThe impact fund, as the CPO revealed, would be deployed to make the eCommerce platform more robust and evolve the game to become a community to period management.\n\nWith more technology positioned towards period tracking, Sanicle\u2019s end game is to make period literacy mainstream to all genders, and not only women.\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t see this\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nFound this gem of an artiste, thanks to a friend this weekend.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

          "text": "The Financial Times (FT) and Statista are currently inviting companies based in Africa to register for recognition in the inaugural ranking of Africa\u2019s Fastest Growing Companies. BusinessDay is a cooperation partner for the research \u2013 and therefore encourages companies from Nigeria to participate. It is also planned that a separate ranking with Nigeria\u2019s Growth Champions will be published on businessday.ng.\n\nRegistration to be considered both for the Africa and Nigeria ranking is free of charge and the criteria are outlined here. The research wants to identify the companies with the highest revenue growth between 2017-2020. Companies with an average revenue growth rate of at least 8 percent annually in this period are encouraged to register.\n\nThis initiative of the Financial Times, the UK-based global business and economics daily, and Statista, the German-based data giant, is the first of its kind. It is supported by BusinessDay, West Africa\u2019s provider of premium market and financial intelligence.\n\nOgho Okiti, Managing Director of BusinessDay, speaking on the cooperation said, \u201cBusinessDay is delighted to support Statista and FT in their quest to identify the fastest growing companies on the continent. After all, it fits our journalistic mission to provide understanding of how the economy is evolving and the business landscape is shifting.\u201d\n\nThomas Clark, Partner at Statista, expects mostly small and mid-sized companies to enter the ranking, with the vast majority of them being privately held instead of stock-listed. \u201cThe aim of this mega-research project is to identify the companies which serve as the accelerators for the economy \u2013 and while we are curious to see overall which companies in Africa belong to this group, I am particularly excited to see the Nigerian ones\u201d, explains Clark, adding a personal note: \u201cAfter all, one of my best friends from my days as a student is Nigerian and I am well aware that the country has changed a lot since those days in the 90s, with Nigeria now being the cradle for many impressive start-ups and vibrant mid-sized companies.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural ranking of Africa\u2019s fastest growing companies will be featured online on FT.com and in a special report, following similar rankings and reports produced for Europe, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBusinessDay hopes that the ranking will turn into an annual edition, equally the envisioned list of Nigeria\u2019s Growth Champions on businessday.ng.\n\nIn the last few years, African companies, especially those which are into the provision of financial and telecommunications services have seen expansion in their operations within and outside of their regions.\n\nRead also: Nigerian fintechs walk tight rope after record funding\n\nIn addition, African fintech companies have attracted significant attention from investors in recent times. And according to Making Finance Work for Africa, as of the end of the third quarter of 2021, African fintech companies had raised $1.44 billion in 71 deals registered within the nine months ended September 2021.\n\nInterestingly, the amount African fintech firms raised between January and September 2021 was higher than $1.06 billion raised between 2011 and 2020 by 35.8 percent. This means African fintech companies in nine months in 2021, surpassed a decade of their fundraising records.\n\nThe positive sentiment on growth is expected to continue in 2022 due to the moderate growth trajectory projected for the African continent next year.

          "title": "CNG can save Nigeria N3trn, but infrastructure lacking",
          "text": "Switching from petrol to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) can save Nigeria as much as N3 trillion yearly but this requires a political will to fix the teething problems facing the country\u2019s domestic gas sector, experts have said.\n\nThe world is turning away from petrol to CNG as an alternative energy source because it is cheaper and burns cleaner. But Nigeria is yet to come to terms with this global development as the controversial fuel subsidy projected to hit N3 trillion by the end of 2021 continues to crowd out other development expenditures.\n\nExperts say converting from petrol to Natural Gas Vehicles (NGV), a campaign Egypt has taken head-on and making progress with, is a necessity that can reduce Nigeria\u2019s exposure to the wasteful subsidy regime.\n\nThey have noted that despite the high cost of conversion kits for CNG, its utilisation can help Africa\u2019s largest economy leverage its 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, cut down excessive addiction for fuel demands and convert the country from an oil to a gas giant in the template of Australia or Qatar.\n\n\u201cThese conversion kits are imported and should the government work out favourable terms and conditions such as free import duties and tax incentives, the cost per kit will fall and more car owners will participate; there is demand, no doubt,\u201d Ola Alokolaro, partner Energy and Infrastructure at Advocaat Law Practice said.\n\nThe numbers look good too. Nigeria spent a combined total of N905.27billion to keep the pump price of petrol at N145 per litre as of August 2021. But without subsidies, CNG per cubic metre costs between N100 and N110 per standard cubic meter (the equivalent of a litre).\n\n\u201cCNG can save Nigeria billions of naira as cars run on a cleaner and healthier fuel, but the sector needs more action from the government, not promises or projections,\u201d said Niyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Petroleum Downstream Expo, the managing director of Total Energies, Samba Seye announced the company was making plans to construct two CNG stations in Abuja and Lagos expected to become operational within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cThe project will be predicated on two issues which include government policies on the scheme and profitability of the endeavour,\u201d Seye said at the event.\n\nHe listed some of the fiscal incentives to attract investors in the area of gas utilisation for vehicles to include tax holidays for upward of five years, removal of Value Added Tax (VAT) on natural gas vehicles components on imported materials like conversion kits among others.\n\nA survey by BusinessDay shows it costs between N350, 000 and N450, 000 to purchase the kit needed in converting a car from a petrol or diesel engine to a CNG engine, depending on the nature and condition of the car. But experts say the conversion leads to a 40 percent savings in energy cost for car owners.\n\nRead also: Why Nigeria\u2019s decade of gas requires a master plan\n\n\u201cNGVs maintenance costs are lower because CNG is a cleaner-burning fuel and generates less wear-and-tear on some engine components,\u201d Awodeyi, explained.\n\nTunji Adeniji, former president, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) recently converted his Toyota Hilux truck to use CNG (two cylinders) at the NIPCO gas station at Ibafo, which also houses a conversion workshop.\n\nAdeniji says the two cylinders take him as far as Lokoja from Lagos where there is a CNG refuelling station. It cost N7, 000 to fuel at Ibafo and another N7, 000 at Lokoja for refuel to get to Abuja. This is a trip that costs N25, 000 on petrol in the same vehicle to Lokoja and another N25, 000 from there to Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe savings are massive,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough there is a lack of holistic action by the federal government to attract investment, some investors are bracing the odds with tales of bold innovations, social investments, and local capacity development.\n\nFor instance, NIPCO Plc, a Nigerian energy company, is currently constructing a pipeline from Ibafo-Sagamu-Ibadan to provide CNG services for industries.\n\nAccording to Ramesh Virwani, the managing director of NIPCO Gas Limited, the company, which got its licence to operate in 2007, has seven gas stations in Benin, with other stations in Lagos and Delta states.\n\nThe company has also laid 51 kilometres of gas pipeline in Benin to distribute the CNG to the seven stations in the city and built the capacity to dispense 500 standard cubic metres and dispense to no fewer than 20,000 vehicles.\n\nAlso, Powergas Limited is in talks with ECO Bus maker to provide autogas filling stations in Nigerian cities where CNG-powered vehicles can be refuelled and will be put to good use.\n\nNonetheless, investors want the government to match intent with actions.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs more investors who can set up CNG for commercial services but what are the returns on investment, especially when there are no clear policy directions from the government,\u201d Awodeji said.\n\nA report by KPMG, a global network of auditing firms, says the current state of the Nigerian gas industry has shown that the pricing regime is not sufficiently attractive to potential investors, despite the vast opportunities.\n\n\u201cTo boost gas availability for CNG purposes, a holistic approach to gas pricing that will accommodate the dynamics for gas and create headway for businesses within the gas value chain to thrive concurrently is paramount,\u201d KPMG said in a report titled Evolution of Compressed Natural Gas in Nigeria.\n\nThe report advised the federal government to provide a transparent and hitch-free licensing process for proposed CNG outlet investors.\n\nJustice Derefaka, technical adviser, Gas Business and Policy Implementation to the minister of petroleum resources has on a number of occasions stated that the federal government has made available a million conversion kits. However, many Nigerians are unsure how the kits would be distributed \u2013 subsidised or given out free of charge.\n\nHowever, without CNG refuelling stations, experts say the Federal Government\u2019s drive to deepen gas utilisation for transportation through its autogas programme is likely to suffer significant setbacks.\n\nLaunched under the National Gas Expansion Program (NGEP) in December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s autogas programme was aimed at transiting Nigeria from the use of petrol to gas for automobiles as a way of deepening the penetration and utilisation of gas in various forms.\n\nHowever, BusinessDay findings have shown that ten months after the launch of the programme, the hope of meeting the target of converting one million vehicles by the end of 2021 may be dashed as the programme is yet to be opened to members of the public.",

          "title": "Parag Agrawal replaces Jack Dorsey as Twitter CEO",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nParag Agrawal is an Indian-American technology expert, on Monday become the new Chief Executive Officer of tech giant, Twitter.\n\nThis follows the decision of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to down as chief of the social media company, effective immediately.\n\nUntil his new elevation, Agrawal, was Twitter\u2019s chief technology officer.\n\nDorsey, 45, was serving as both the CEO of Twitter and Square, his digital payments company. Dorsey will remain a member of the board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders, the company said.\n\nDorsey who gave his reasons for stepping down in a statement on Monday, noted that the choice of Agrawal was made after a rigorous process by the company\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cAfter almost 16 years of having a role at our company\u2026from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO\u2026I decided it\u2019s finally time for me to leave. Why?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being \u201cfounder-led.\u201d Ultimately I believe that\u2019s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I\u2019ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders. There are 3 reasons I believe now is the right time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe first is Parag becoming our CEO. The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag. He\u2019s been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs. Parag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around. He\u2019s curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware, and humble. He leads with heart and soul, and is someone I learn from daily. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep.\n\n\u201cThe second is Bret Taylor agreeing to become our board chair. I asked Bret to join our board when I became CEO, and he\u2019s been excellent in every way. He understands entrepreneurship, taking risks, companies at massive scale, technology, product, and he\u2019s an engineer. All of the things the board and the company deserve right now. Having Bret in this leadership role gives me a lot of confidence in the strength of our board going forward. You have no idea how happy this makes me!\n\n\u201cThe third is all of you. We have a lot of ambition and potential on this team. Consider this: Parag started here as an engineer who cared deeply about our work and now he\u2019s our CEO (I also had a similar path\u2026he did it better!). This alone makes me proud. I know that Parag will be able to channel this energy best because he\u2019s lived it and knows what it takes. All of you have the potential to change the course of this company for the better. I believe this with all my heart!\n\n\u201cParag is CEO starting today. I\u2019m going to serve on the board through my term (May-ish) to help Parag and Bret with the transition. And after that\u2026I\u2019ll leave the board. Why not stay or become chair? I believe it\u2019s really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead. And back to my previous point, I believe it\u2019s critical a company can stand on its own, free of its founder\u2019s influence or direction.\n\n\u201cI want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it. It was a tough one for me, of course. I love this service and company\u2026and all of you so much. I\u2019m really sad\u2026yet really happy. There aren\u2019t many companies that get to this level. And there aren\u2019t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we\u2019ll prove this was the right move.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have an all-hands meeting tomorrow at 9:05 AM Pacific to discuss it all. Until then, thank you all for the trust you\u2019ve placed in me, and for the openness to build that trust in Parag and yourselves. I love you all.\u201d\n\nSales force President and COO Bret Taylor will become the chairman of the board, succeeding Patrick Pichette, a former Google executive, who will remain on the board as chair of the audit committee.\n\nAgrawal, 37, will have to meet Twitter\u2019s aggressive internal goals. The company said earlier this year it aims to have 315 million monetizable daily active users by the end of 2023 and to at least double its annual revenue in that year.\n\nAgrawal, who\u2019s served as CTO since 2017, has been with Twitter for more than a decade. He had been in charge of strategy involving artificial intelligence and machine learning and he led projects to make tweets in users\u2019 timelines more relevant to them.\n\nHe was also previously tasked with finding a leader for Project Bluesky, a research project Twitter launched to establish open and decentralized standards for social media platforms. Dorsey had previously said Bluesky will help social media companies collaborate on how posts are promoted to users and will give users more control over the content they see. Bluesky could also make it easier for the social networks to enforce restrictions against hate speech and other abuse, essentially helping them share the load at a lower cost.\n\nAgrawal held research internships at AT&T, Microsoft and Yahoo before joining Twitter.\n\nDorsey was nearly ousted last year when Twitter stakeholder Elliott Management had sought to replace him. Elliott Management founder and billionaire investor Paul Singer had wondered whether Dorsey should run both of the public companies. Singer called for Dorsey to step down as CEO of one of them before the investment firm reached a deal with Twitter\u2019s management.\n\nElliott issued a statement on Monday\u2019s news, noting that its collaboration with Jack and Twitter over the past couple of years has been productive.\n\n\u201cTwitter is now executing against an ambitious multi-year plan to dramatically increase the company\u2019s reach and value, and we look forward to the next chapter of Twitter\u2019s story,\u201d the company\u2019s managing partner Jesse Cohn and senior portfolio manager Marc Steinberg said. \u201cHaving gotten to know both incoming Chairman Bret Taylor and incoming CEO Parag Agrawal, we are confident that they are the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company.\u201d\n\nDorsey, who co-founded the social media giant in 2006, served as CEO until 2008 before being pushed out of the role. He returned to lead Twitter in 2015 after former CEO Dick Costolo stepped down.\n\nTwitter shares have jumped 85% since Dorsey took over as CEO on Oct 5. 2015. Square stock has surged 1,566% since its initial public offering on Nov. 19, 2015",

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nA new entrant in the Nigerian non-banking market, Lotus Bank, is steadily gaining ground on market leaders, Jaiz Bank Plc and TajBank Limited, by taking out a significant portion of their business and individual accounts, Business Hallmark findings can reveal.\n\nAcross the nation, the bank is rapidly changing the face of non-interest banking by innovating consumer financial services and creating digital systems and infrastructure, thereby building trust among customers.\n\nIt would be recalled that the market leader, Jaiz Bank, took the nation by storm in 2012 when it received an operating license from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as a regional bank with offices and branches in Kano, Kaduna and Abuja as Nigeria\u2019s first non-interest bank.\n\nIt soon grew in bounds, expanding to all the 36 states capitals and major cities after the CBN approved its application to transform into a national bank.\n\nFrom a modest institution with total assets valued at US$88.8million; deposits base of N3.5billion, shareholders\u2019 equity of about US$63.6million, balance sheet of N12billion and 3 branches in 2012, the bank as at September 2021, has a total assets of N250billion; deposit base of over N60billion; 40 branches; balance sheet of N62 billion; asset financing of over N30 billion; over 1 million customer base and Profit After Tax (PAT) of N1.99billionattheendofJune2021.\n\nTAJ Bank was also given a licence by the CBN in 2019 to operate non-interest banking under the Islamic banking principles, seven years after Jaiz started operations.\n\nAs of December 2020, the bank operated four branches in FCT Abuja, the National Assembly Complex, Abuja, Kano and Sokoto States, totalassetsofN10billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N3.456billion in its 2020 financial year, deposit growth rate of 1,524 per cent and customer base of 103,853, from 1,809 at inception.\n\nIn 2020, the bank was appointed by the Federal Government to act as receiving agent for its N150 billion Sukuk Bond, the first time in the firm\u2019s history.\n\nHowever, Lotus Bank\u2019s entry into the fray has distorted the status quo, and has put a major dent in Jaiz and TAJ\u2019s balance sheets, with the bank (Lotus) now controlling a major chunk of the market hitherto controlled by the two.\n\nFounded in July 2021 by Mrs. Hajara Adeola, wife of the former Group Managing Director of Guarantee Trust Bank (GTB) Mr. Fola Adeola, the bank within one year of commencing operations from its headquarters in Victoria Island has entrenched itself as the bank of preference in the South Western part of the country.\n\nAccording to impeccable sources in the bank, its management decided to largely focus on its niche market, the South West.\n\n\u201cThe founders hope to use their expertise and influence as sons and daughters of Yorubaland to gain control of the South West market. Though, Jaiz and TAJ started first as non-interest banks, Lotus Capital, owned by the Adeolas, was the pioneer of non-interest finance in Nigeria.\n\nThe firm used to organise non-interest funding for interested individuals and businesses. It even played a major role in the establishment of Jaiz and TAJ, controlled by northern business concerns, which before now controlled the South West market.\n\n\u201cBut the coming of Lotus has changed the narratives. In just over one year of coming on board, the bank has displaced Jaiz in the South West, and is doing relatively well in Abuja due to its deployment of technology\u201d, one of the sources who craved anonymity told BH.\n\nIn a bold move to take the bank directly to the doorsteps of people in the South West, the banks is establishing branches and offices in major towns and cities in the zone.\n\nApart from its flagship headquarter located in the upscale Adetokunbo Ademola Street in Victoria Island, Lagos, the bank recently opened three other branches in the state. They are the Idumagbo, Lagos Island, Allen Avenue, Ikeja and Terminal 2, Oshodi Transport Interchange, Oshodi branches.\n\nThe bank specialise in three major areas, ethical banking, Islamic finance and investment, deploying digital technology to help its customers experience banking with ease.\n\nAlso, apart from issuing free debit cards to account holders with zero-account maintenance charges, the bank\u2019s digital offerings enable customers to open accounts online and transact business through USSD banking.\n\nThe bank is also sweeping the carpet off the feet of her competitors by operating Hajj Saving Schemes for Muslim pilgrims nationwide.\n\nBH reliably gathered that the pilgrims\u2019 boards of all the six South Western states have retained the bank as the preferred banker for all Hajj related matters.\n\nThe bank\u2019s greatest strength is in the array of professionals that pilot its affairs. The team is led by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Kafilat Araoye, a thoroughbred professional with over 25 years of commercial banking experience.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Divisional Head, Corporate Services (Human Resources, Brand and Marketing Communications), Funso Tooki, said the bank started its operations on a solid foundation of experienced leadership and a strong advisory council of experts.\n\n\u201cOur focus and guiding principle is to deliver an alternative option to interest-based banking and to cater to the needs of not just the banked but also the under-banked and unbanked population.\n\n\u201cNon-Interest Banking is geared towards supporting the real sector and LOTUS Bank aims to improve financial inclusion in the country. In addition, the bank will operate transparent pricing models as is the norm in non-interest banking\u201d, Tooki said.\n\nAlso speaking, the bank\u2019s CEO, Kafilat Araoye, said Lotus Bank was set up with the aim of financially embracing all classes of people.\n\n\u201cWith evolving digital solutions and a millennial generation coming into centre-stage, LOTUS Bank is bringing onboard innovative and comprehensive non-interest compliant financial solutions in investment banking, consumer banking, asset management, private banking, and wealth management.\n\n\u201cAt LOTUS Bank, we believe in fairness to all parties in every business transaction. This is a requirement for building a strong economy.\n\n\u201cEveryone can thrive where fairness prevails. Non-interest banking stands for equity and ethics in business, as well as growth for the real sector.\n\n\u201cFinancial Inclusion is also a strong motive for setting up LOTUS Bank. The concept of financial inclusion targeting the unbanked and under-banked population cannot remain just a concept but must be seen as an actual necessity for the nation\u2019s economic growth,\u201d Araoye stated.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nBefore now, Nigerians had only read or watched news about the deadly drug cartels in the central American country of Mexico; a country where drug gangs are known to have committed mass murder and rendered whole neighbourhoods desolate. But now, the same Mexican cartels are being fingered in a new drug epidemic that has enveloped Africa\u2019s most populous country. Precisely, in the country\u2019s Southeast region where the scourge of Methamphetamine or simply Crystal Meth, known locally as Mkpuru mmiri; a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system, is ruining lives, destroying homes and has put the entire region on edge.\n\nMeth, as it\u2019s often called, looks like glass fragments or shiny, bluish-whiterocks. It is chemically similar to amphetamine, a drug used to treat attention-deficit hyper activity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.\n\nThe substance increases the amount of the natural chemical dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in body movement, motivation, and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors. The drug\u2019s ability to rapidly release high levels of dopamine in reward areas of the brain strongly reinforces drug-taking behavior, making the user want to repeat the experience, hence the ease with which people are addicted to it.\n\nConsuming of even small amounts of the substance can result in many health effects such increased wakefulness and physical activity, changes in libido, decreased appetite, faster breathing, rapid and/or irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure and body temperature, among others in the short term.\n\nLong term effects on the other hand, include extreme weight loss, severe dental problems known as \u201cmeth mouth,\u201d intense itching, leading to skin sores from scratching, anxiety, changes in brain structure and function, confusion, memory loss, sleeping problems, violent behavior, paranoia\u2014extreme and unreasonable distrust of others and hallucinations.\n\nNigeria has historically had drug problems. And it\u2019s a challenge that has kept getting worse with a youth bulge battling unemployment and harsh economic realities. One in every seven people, chairman of the country\u2019s National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Buba Marwa said, is addicted to drugs. More so in Kano, Northwest where according to him, it\u2019s one in every six persons.\n\n\u201cThe drug scourge is now an epidemic in Nigeria. The prevalence is 15 percent, three times the global average,\u201d Marwa said when he visited Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu in March. \u201cOne in seven Nigerians take drugs. We have found out that there is a nexus between drug use and crime.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, drug abuse prevalence is 16 per cent; that is, in every six persons, one is a drug addict and they are between the ages of 15 years and 64 years.\u201d\n\nMarwa\u2019s point that there is a nexus between drug addiction and crime is a given; a reality many residents of the Southeast are waking up to in the wake of the enveloping addiction to meth.\n\n\u201cThe young men who take the substance are increasingly taking to crime. In the night they would be going about stealing and constituting nuisance in the society,\u201d said Chidi Nwafor a business owner in Amawbia, Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIf you go to my place in Nibo, there are a number of young men who are addicted to the drug. At night, they would be going to people\u2019s homes to steal money, goats, generators and so on. The consumption rate is quite alarming especially among young people, even in Amawbia here.\u201d\n\nIn Anambra, like the rest of South Eastern states, the challenge is becoming endemic. Perhaps even more so in Imo.\n\nLast week, a young man from Mgbidi, Oru West Local Government of Imo State, not more than 25, was said to have killed his mother and sister after overdosing on meth, an atrocity that drew the ire of community members who quickly rallied and stoned him to death.\n\nIt\u2019s not an isolated incident. Since the consumption of meth took root in the region in the last three years or so, it\u2019s been tales of crime, ruined livelihoods and death. Young men looking haggard from obvious effect of meth are a routine sight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d said Kenneth Nnaji, a community leader in Amechi, Enugu State. \u201cA lot of people are taking Mkpuru Mmiri, but it\u2019s those it is already having effects on their bodies that you easily tell. We are compiling the names of people selling the drugs, and those taking it. When we are done, we will begin to take serious action.\u201d\n\nVarious communities have taken up the challenge of fighting the menace. In various communities in Anambra, Imo and elsewhere, identified addicts are given corporal punishment; tied to stakes and whipped severely. Feedbacks suggest it\u2019s achieving results. Some have turned the corner. But drug problem is often hardly tractable. It is still a huge challenge and stakeholders are not oblivious of the enormity of the problem.\n\n\u201cLike every effort, you will just keep doing your best, but the results may not come immediately,\u201d said Chief Alex Ogbonnia, spokesperson for Ohanaeze Ndigbo. \u201cWhen it is something that affect the youth, you may not see the results immediately. But the important thing is that an awareness has been created in all the communities in Igboland with respect to the dangers in taking Mkpuru Mmiri. That awareness has made a lot of people to stop taking the drug.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze, the apex Igbo socio cultural group, said it is coordinating effort in this regard, through various town unions. But tackling a challenge of such magnitude requires a lot more, especially from state authorities, which appear to be lacking at the moment.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze is structured in such away that every town union president is a vice chairman at the local government level. That makes the coordination easy,\u201d Chief Ogbonnia said. \u201cWe are working with town union presidents. It is a holistic effort.\u201d\n\nBoth Ohanaeze youth wing and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), have also taken up the challenge.\n\nOn Friday, November 19, Ohanaeze the Ohanaeze Ndi-Igbo Worldwide-Youth Wing met in Owerri and constituted a task force chaired by Comrade Onyekachi Eweh, with the mandate to carry out far-reaching sensitization campaigns across the length and breadth of Igboland, using the mass media and through seminars and road walks with the aim to enlighten members of the public, especially; youths, parents, teachers ,guardians, community vigilantes, and all relevant stakeholders on the dangers, attributes and distribution channels of \u201cthese illicit and invidious substances.\u201d\n\nThe task force is also to liaise with relevant security agencies, especially, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, towards eradicating the production, distribution and peddling of these harmful substances anywhere in Igboland.\n\nOn Tuesday last week, IPOB in a statement by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, vowed to go after the distributors and consumers of the substance in the zone, noting that consumption and selling of the destructive hard drug by South east youths can never be accepted or welcomed in any part of the region.\n\n\u201cWe the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, notes with utter displeasure a very ugly and disturbing trend among some youths in Biafra land who have resorted to the consumption of a destructive hard drug methamphetamine, popularly known as \u2018Mkpuru Mmiri.\u2019 This development is very strange and completely unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Powerful said\n\n\u201cIPOB hereby declares war against this nonsense. We shall go after those taking or distributing this harmful illicit drug. Henceforth, anyone found peddling, consuming or in any way involved in the distribution of this illicit drug shall be decisively dealt with.\u201d\n\nFrantic efforts are being made by all stakeholders to curb the menace. But tracking the supply chain has remained a challenge, even as there is no clear answer yet as to how the substance finds its way into the country on such large scale. Most meth in North America is produced by transactional criminal organizations in Mexico, hence the idea that the cartel in Nigeria came from the country. But the suggestion that the supply chain is run by a Mexican cartel is not supported by much evidence. Others have said the cartel is run by local drug dealers who have set up laboratories in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of such laboratories in Nigeria; in the Southeast, and some actions are ongoing to clamp down on them. We are cutting the supply from source,\u201d said Mr. Femi Babafemi, spokesperson for NDLEA.\n\nBabafemi said arrests have been made, and 18 of such laboratories have so far been destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere have been some arrests,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe issue statements on this almost weekly. We arrest people every week. We are moving to the next phase, which is shutting down the pipelines themselves, that is the laboratories. So far in recent years, the agency has shut down 18 of such laboratories. We are going to be doing something intensive very soon. When you shut the pipeline, you are cutting availability and access to that drug. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing because if it is not available then it can\u2019t circulate.\u201d\n\nNDLEA\u2019s effort has not yielded very obvious results thus far. But the agency has a lot on its plate in a country where abuse of drug is endemic, and it\u2019s an ongoing effort. From concoctions made from local materials to hemp and codeine and cocaine, drug use, mostly among youths in the country, is common place. But meth, for its devastating effects on the body, is attracting most attention in the interim.\n\nPerhaps not surprising in a country with 42.5 percent youth unemployment. There also appears to be a nexus between drug use prevalence and high rate of unemployment. Until recently, drug abuse in the country was thought to be mostly a Northern problem, even if the South was not immune from it.\n\nBut the growing consumption of meth with its devastating consequences has shifted the focus to the Southeast. The region, coincidentally is battling its worst unemployment crisis ever, worsened by lack of access to funds which having your own people in power in Abuja provides, especially in a largely rentier economy like Nigeria\u2019s. The zone, many say, is practically shut out from the national tap in Abuja by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari whose body language is seen as mostly anti Southeast.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s a very tempting argument to link prevalence of drug use to poverty and unemployment. There is a tendency for those confronted with harsh economic realities to take to drugs as a sort of escape. But the link between poverty and drug is fluid. Drug abuse is prevalent, too, among the rich, perhaps even worse, observers say.\n\n\u201cDrug use is endemic in Nigeria, but it is not only among the poor. It is a problem even in rich homes,\u201d said Dr. Bongo Adi, a senior lecturer at Lagos Business School. \u201cIn fact, there are many rich people that are struggling with drug. A lot of the elite you know in Nigeria are addicts but you wouldn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThe people who brought this culture of drug are not the poor people in the villages. It is actually exposed individuals who have access to these drugs because to sustain a lifestyle of drug is not cheap. The young men will only go down to the level of meth may be because it is cheaper or more affordable compared to other substances. But so many people that walk around in Lagos actually addicted to drugs.\u201d\n\nMeth, is indeed highly pure, potent, and low in price. The drug can easily be made in small clandestine laboratories, with relatively in expensive over-the-counter ingredients such as pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in cold medications. The production also involves a number of other very dangerous chemicals whose effects can remain in the environment long after the lab has been shut down, causing a wide range of health problems for people living in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is a menace,\u201d Adi said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been there. Drug addiction and drug abuse have been an issue for Nigerian youths for a very long time. Before now, we thought it was mainly a problem of the North be cause I have been in the fore front of fighting drug abuse in the country.\n\n\u201cDrug abuse was prevalent in the North and when I returned from the American University around year 2000; between 2000 and 2005, what we did at the time was to try to root it out by attacking the sources of supply. But what happens is that when you tackle the source of supply for a particular drug they device other means of getting high.\n\n\u201cAt that time I didn\u2019t know that it was also endemic in the Southeast. In fact it is a nationwide problem. Even here in Lagos, it is a big problem. If you move around the construction sites, you will see crowd of young people taking all manner of substances. They take a whole lot of drugs.\n\n\u201cI had an experience when I followed a friend of mine who is in to construction to one of his construction sites. And when I saw a lot of young women taking drugs here and there, I approached them to ask why they were doing so and whether they didn\u2019t know that what they were taking was harmful.\n\n\u201cThey told me that taking the drug was the only way they could get inspiration and the strength to do the work that they do. Some of them are married. That\u2019s really what gives them the inspiration to keep going; to do those very hard jobs.\u201d",

          "text": "Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, said the transportation sector was key to realising the major objectives of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nThe minister, who spoke at the international conference on the Role of Transportation in the implementation of AfCFTA, organised by National Institute of Transport Technology (NITT) on Monday in Abuja, said transportation is essential for economic and social development as it provides vital links between centers of production and markets.\n\nRepresented by the minister of state, Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, the minister said the sector was critical in implementing trade facilitation, enhancing regional integration and key to every other AfCFTA protocol.\n\nAmaechi, while reiterating the commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration towards providing efficient transport system in the country, said the government was embarking on huge transport infrastructure investment across the country.\n\nThe minister, however, said the greatest challenge facing infrastructural development in Africa was maintenance of the infrastructure for sustainable service delivery.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe transportation Sector is blessed with myriad of potentials and opportunities for development.\n\n\u201dThe current administration will not leave any stone unturned in its efforts to transform the Sector for the benefits of Nigerian Citizens.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the NITT council chairman, Olorogun John, reiterated the need for connectivity between trade and transportation.\n\nAlso, the director-general, NITT, Dr Bayero Salih-Farah, said transportation was the gateway to economic growth and prosperity and every other sector depends on transportation for growth and progress and it is heartwarming that the current administration under the able leadership of President Buhari has realised the critical role of transportation, and was working assiduously to make the Nigerian transport system among the best in Africa.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTransport infrastructure is widely seen as an enabling industry that facilitates national, regional and international integration and trade.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dAn effective transport system promotes competitiveness, market accessibility and economic growth. It is high time Nigeria started taking advantage of being the largest economy in Africa.\n\n\u201dIt is argued that intra-African trade stands at about 15 per cent, an abysmal fact attributable to unnecessary bottlenecks and infrastructure deficit.\n\n\u201dTherefore, there is urgent need for massive investment in connectivity and transportation infrastructure, because transportation is the link between all the factors of production.\u201d",

However, it is now obvious to most people in the Yoruba Self-Determination struggle that the LNC is not working in tandem with our objective in Ilana Omo Oodua.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this development is that the prestigious leadership that Professor Adebanji Stephen Akintoye, has provided for NINAS as Chairman since inception has now come to an end from today Tuesday 30th November, 2021.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Ilana Omo Oodua hereby withdraw its membership of NINAS with immediate effect. All the Yoruba People Worldwide that believe in the agitation for Yoruba Nation Self-Determination at home and abroad are, by this statement, notified to comply.\n\n\u201cWe are, however, pleased to inform you that a more productive Wide-Alliance to be known as the South and Middle-Belt People\u2019s Sovereign Movement (SOMPSOM) will be officially inaugurated after the completion of the ongoing consultations with likeminds across the South and Middle-Belt Regions.\u201d\n\nE-Signed\n\n1.

          "text": "Hundreds of federal civil officials, particularly in Abuja\u2019s Federal Capital Territory, are rushing to hospitals and approved vaccination centers to get the COVID-19 vaccines before the December 1 deadline for them to be barred from their jobs.\n\nThis comes in the aftermath of the devastating effects of another COVID-19 version known as Omicron, which has put the world on high alert as many countries consider closing their borders and restricting mobility, according to Daily Trust.\n\nWorkers who have not received the COVID-19 vaccine will be denied entrance to government offices beginning tomorrow, December 1, 2021, according to the federal government.\n\nHundreds of public servants were in a last-minute rush to acquire the vaccine in Abuja, according to Daily Trust, as many centers reported a large influx of civil servants.\n\nMany individuals were hurrying to get vaccinated, according to an unnamed source at the Federal Secretariat vaccination center.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have been able to vaccinate dozens of civil servants and their family members with the Astrazeneca and Modena today. Also, we have been able to administer the second round of the COVID-19 vaccine to many people today. The second jab is administered eight weeks after the first jab,\u201d the health worker said.\n\n\u201cIt will be difficult to tell you the exact number of civil servants\u2026It will not be easy because of ongoing replacements, new recruitments, deaths and all that. So, I don\u2019t think if you will get the exact number of civil servants that have been vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Director Communication, Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHoCSF), Malam Abdulganiyu Aminu, said they could not be specific on the actual number of civil servants vaccinated, especially for the fact that the exercise was ongoing.\n\nIn an interview, he said, \u201cBut reports reaching us from the various vaccination centres are encouraging. Many civil servants are responding to the call to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaibu, had said that as of November 26, a total of 6,242,224 Nigerians had received the first dose of COVID-19.\n\nHe also said 3,487,298 Nigerians had received their second dose and therefore fully vaccinated.\n\nThis meant only 1.7 per cent of the total population target of 111,776,503 has been vaccinated.\n\nThe federal government had last Friday ordered federal workers from Grade Level 12 and below to resume normal duty effective from Wednesday, December 1.\n\nDr Folasade Yemi-Esan, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), issued the directive in a circular dated November 26, 2021 with the reference number HCSF/3065/Vol.1/107.\n\nOfficers on GL 12 and below were required to work from home as part of the COVID-19 Pandemic containment procedures, she recalled.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, on the other hand, has signed the Vaccine Mandate Policy, which requires all federal government employees to provide confirmation of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nMr Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19, had also declared that all federal employees would be prevented from working beginning December 1 unless they could provide proof of coronavirus vaccination.\n\nSome federal employees voiced conflicting sentiments about the situation on Monday.\n\nWhile some believed it was excellent that the government made the COVID-19 immunization mandatory in the national interest, others said it infringed on their constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cI am happy that the government has made it mandatory for workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d a worker with the ministry of power, said.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that we don\u2019t trust our government because from the look of things, millions of Nigerians are not willing to take the jab and this is dangerous.\n\n\u201cLook at how the variant is mutating. Look at the Omicron that is ravaging the world. Government must deploy all the resources it has to ensure that all Nigerians are vaccinated not only civil servants. The civil servants are a fraction of the over 200m people in the country. It is saddening that up till now less than 2 per cent have been vaccinated. We are sitting on a time bomb,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Factional APC caretaker c\u2019ttee impostors \u2013 Akpanudoedehe",
          "text": "There appears to be a confusion of sort in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) with some members forming a parallel national caretaker committee, purportedly sacking the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and scheduling the party\u2019s convention for February 26, 2022.\n\nBut the Buni-led CECPC has disowned the group which it described as impostors, and asked security agents to swoop on them.\n\nThe new group which appointed President Muhammadu Buhari as head of its advisory committee also named Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and others as members of the new caretaker Committee.\n\nAddressing journalists Monday in Abuja, the group under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) announced the sack of the Buni-led committee and announced a new national caretaker committee with Mustapha Audu as chairman.\n\nAudu, who briefed journalists on the development, also announced the formation of a national reconciliation committee with a mandate to reconcile aggrieved members before its national convention slated for February, 26, 2021.\n\nHe said a zoning formula for positions in the new National Working Committee is expected to emerge at a national convention slated for February 26, 2022.\n\nWhile inaugurating the new committee, Audu the self-acclaimed national chairman said: \u201cToday, we are here to inaugurate the PYM \u2013 CECPC, these young men and women of noble repute have been carefully selected and mandated by all the well-meaning young stakeholders of our great party- the APC- to plan and execute our convention before the end of February 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the plethora of issues within the party. Our party has had a history of shying away from true reconciliation and in many cases inflicting chastisement on members that should have been rewarded for their effort towards building the APC. We will also be setting up a reconciliatory committee to help reconcile aggrieved members within the party.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that in the last couple of years, the party has been on a regressive course and it is necessary for all well-meaning party members to roll up our sleeves and do the needful to ensure that we correct the mistakes that have been made to ensure victory in 2023 for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would advise all party members to look inwards and understand the need to do things differently so that we can ensure we win back the trust of the Nigerian people as we move closer to the election year.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s join hands and strengthen our internal democracy in our dear party- the APC- and show Nigerians that we have what it takes and we deserve their votes in 2023,\u201d Audu added.\n\nCCEPC reacts\n\nReacting to the development in a statement, National Secretary of the Buni-led CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, described the new group as a \u201cpaid and misguided group.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cWe have received several enquiries from the media and concerned APC members on the felonious activities of a purported group parading themselves as \u201cProgressive Youth Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purported group and membership are unknown to the Party, its structure or as a registered support group. Hence, we completely disown them and cannot account for their activities or join issues with them.\n\n\u201cHowever laughable, the criminal attempt of the purported group to usurp the leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC now bothers (sic) on treasonable felony. Relevant security bodies must now check and address their unscrupulous activities.\n\n\u201cThe attention the purported group seeks will not be given to them by the party. We can only advise that the general public completely disregard them. Members of this group are not registered members of the APC and are being used by opposition elements and fifth columnists to cause confusion.\n\n\u201cAs widely reported, the successful meeting between the APC leadership, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and the President produced February 2022 as the timeframe for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\n\u201cOur focus now is preparing the ground for a rancour-free exercise.\u201d\n\nSheriff tackles Buhari, govs\n\nIn a related development, an APC national chairmanship aspirant and former Borno state Governor Alimodu Sheriff has warned President Buhari and governors elected on the party platform against jettisoning the party\u2019s constitutional requirements for a national convention.\n\nThe former governor said both the president and the APC governors lacked the power to fix a date for the party\u2019s national convention unless a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting is summoned.\n\nSheriff spoke through his campaign media director, Senator Victor Lar in Abuja Monday.\n\nHe said the February date must therefore be rectified by the party\u2019s NEC to make it constitutional.\n\n\u201cWe want to add that though we have commended the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) for taking the initiative to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari on the need for the party\u2019s National Convention to hold, the decision to hold the convention in February 2022 has to be by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\n\u201cIt is normal for members of the party\u2019s national caucus to meet that meeting between the PGF and the president was maybe a partial caucus meeting, even though it was not properly constituted and convened.\n\n\u201cBut both the governors and the president do not have the constitutional powers to take such decision. That decision is supposed to be taken by the party\u2019s NEC. So, we suggest that the APC governors, the president and the party should call a NEC meeting to rectify that February 2022 suggestion for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\u201cThe president does not have the constitutional powers to call for a meeting, neither do the governors. It is only the party\u2019s NEC that can take such decision as regards when its national convention will hold.\n\n\u201cWe, however, appeal to our members and supporters to remain calm and focused, we are on course and victory is certain,\u201d Modu Sheriff said.\n\nWhen asked to comment on media reports that APC has zoned the national chairmanship position to the North-central, Senator Lar described the report as laughable.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Modu Sheriff Campaign Organisation finds the purported story as very laughable because the organs of the party that are supposed to communicate that kind of information, are not the ones communicating it, for that reason, we will take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n\u201cAgain, the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party has never adopted zoning. At what point did they start zoning that they are talking about zoning the party\u2019s national championship position to the North Central?\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an open contest and the best candidate should emerge for the party to be galvanised for victory in 2023 and Sheriff remains the best candidate. We find the report as the very poor scheming of people who are scared of contesting the position with Sheriff.\u201d\n\nParty denies zoning\n\nSpeaking on zoning, the APC said it did not discuss or reach any decision to zone its national chairmanship position to the North-central zone as reported in a section of the media.\n\nThe party\u2019s scribe, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said the issue of zoning was not in the mandate of the CECPC. \u201cI have the mandate to report whatever decision the CECPC takes and to the best of my knowledge, the committee has not discussed zoning.\u201d\n\nHe added that with the party\u2019s national convention fixed for February 2022, it was expected that party members would come up with different zoning speculations.\n\n\u201cPeople are just flying what will favour their interest, all I know is that the caretaker committee has not discussed or reached a zoning decision,\u201d he said.\n\nMustapha lauds Buni c\u2019teee\n\nAlso speaking on the party leadership, a top national chairman ship aspirant, Malam Salihu Mustapha said the Buni-led committee was on course in its given assignment.\n\nHe said contrary to expectations in certain quarters, there was no uncertainty in the direction of the party under Buni\u2019s watch.\n\nMustapha said this at an interactive session with journalists recently in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere should be no blame game at this stage in our party. Honestly, there should be no blame game. Don\u2019t forget the caretaker committee has the mandate to stabilise the party, and that Governor Buni is doing creditably well. I think we should give it to him. This is not the time to be pointing accusing fingers. We must come together to ensure the committee realises its set objective of stabilising the party.\n\n\u201cYes, the committee is on course. No uncertainty in party direction. We are on the right course and we must not allow this collective effort to be derailed. The prayer is that we (referring to his chances) come out victorious so we, as a party, under my watch In Shaa Allah, can deliver dividends of democracy to Nigeria beyond the tenure of the present administration.\u201d\n\nOn what he hopes to do differently if he emerges as the party\u2019s chair, Mustapha, who was the deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) led by Buhari, said \u201cwhat I will do differently is looking at the future via what is obtainable now.\n\n\u201cIt is against this background that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made a 25-year-old man its national youth leader. So, if making a woman the national chairman is a strategy for a party to win election, why not?\u201d\n\nAssuring of a brighter chance over all fellow top contenders, the youthful politician said \u201cmy youthful age is an added advantage. Any party that wants to win in 2023 has to factor in the young generation because 75 per cent of the votes belong to the youths.\n\n\u201cThe ENDSARS has revealed some lessons.

It has also noted President Buhari\u2019s response which both raised very weighty issues related to the request, and his commitment to consider it.\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that there are no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request and advises that President Buhari will do serious injury to a country already threatened by multiple challenges to its security and territorial integrity if he delays announcing the only responsible response, which is that the judicial process in the case of Kanu must be allowed to run its course.\n\n\u201cThe Forum noted a judicial decision to label bandits and kidnappers as terrorists, and recommends greater clarity in terms of the targets of this development. In any event, the Forum cautions against profiling and targeting all Fulani as terrorists. Millions of law-abiding Fulani exist, who should be encouraged to stay on the side of the law, while those who have chosen to continue on the path of criminality should feel the full weight of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Forum advises that the National census planned for 2022 should be postponed until after the 2023 elections. The integrity and success of a sensitive and vital activity such as this will be compromised by destabilized and threatened communities and proximity to another sensitive activity such as general elections.\n\n\u201cThe Forum invites attention to the hardship under which the vast majority of the population lives. Increasing poverty levels and widespread insecurity demand that leaders should exercise extreme caution in taking economic and security-related decisions.\n\n\u201cIncrease in the price of fuel in particular will compound the already desperate condition of living of most Nigerians.

And what we know, for now, is that we do not have a case in Nigeria at the moment.\n\n\u201cNow, we have a pipeline of samples that are in process, whose results will be ready tomorrow; so this situation, of course, can change.\u201d\n\nMinister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said authorities were \u201cadopting a watchful, waiting posture.\u201d\n\nThe Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, is believed to be highly transmissible, but it is not yet clear how deadly it is to public health.\n\nREAD ALSO: Biden Rules Out Further Travel Restrictions Over Omicron\n\nThe World Health Organization has listed Omicron as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d and countries around the world are now restricting travel from southern Africa, where the new strain was first detected and taking other new precautions.\n\nOn Sunday, Canadian authorities said the country had detected its first cases of the new strain of in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.\n\nBut members of the PSC said they were waiting on their Canadian counterparts for more details since there are no direct flights between Nigeria and Canada.\n\nPandemic treaty\n\nMeanwhile, the WHO believes the world must study the wreckage of Covid-19 and say \u201cnever again\u201d by striking a pandemic preparedness treaty.\n\nDirector-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday said another disastrous pandemic was bound to happen unless countries showed the resolve to strengthen global defences.\n\nNations are meeting in Geneva from Monday to Wednesday to discuss an international agreement setting out how to handle the next pandemic \u2014 which experts fear is only a matter of time.\n\nThe gathering comes with the planet still besieged by Covid-19, nearly two years on from the first cases recorded in China, and now shaken by Omicron/\n\nWHO member states reached a consensus Sunday on kick-starting the process towards a pandemic treaty.\n\nThe draft decision was secured after countries agreed to compromise \u2014 notably the United States, which is luke-warm on whether the outcome needs to be a legally-binding treaty.\n\nThe decision is expected to be formalised on Wednesday.\n\nShadow of Omicron\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is,\u201d Tedros told world leaders at the start of the three-day gathering.\n\n\u201cOmicron demonstrates just why the world needs a new accord on pandemics.\n\n\u201cOmicron\u2019s very emergence is another reminder that although many of us might think we\u2019re done with Covid-19, it\u2019s not done with us.\n\n\u201cIt will all happen again unless you, the nations of the world, can come together to say with one voice: never again.\u201d\n\nThis meeting of the World Health Assembly \u2014 the WHO\u2019s decision-making body comprising all 194 member states \u2014 is an unprecedented special session on how to handle the next pandemic.\n\nIt should thrash out how far countries are prepared to go towards legally-binding commitments on issues like equitable vaccine distribution, knowledge-sharing, financing and oversight structures, with any final deal due to come into force in 2024.\n\nA key issue down the line could be whether countries want beefed-up powers for the WHO to investigate the sources of outbreaks. Tedros said the lack of data-sharing early in the Covid pandemic had been a hindrance.\n\n\u201cOne of the expectations of this treaty is to be able to improve the WHO\u2019s capacity to monitor and assess the situation in countries: the investigative power of WHO,\u201d a French diplomatic source said.\n\n\u2018Make history\u2019\n\nChilean President Sebastian Pinera said the world was unprepared for Covid-19 and \u201cfor that weakness, we all paid a great price.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteps must be taken to ensure that this will not happen again, that when the next pandemic comes, and it will come, it will find us better prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the draft decision, WHO member states agree to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body \u201cto draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response\u201d.\n\nThe body\u2019s first meeting must be no later than March 1 next year to elect two co-chairs and four vice-chairs.\n\nA progress report will be presented at the regular World Health Assembly annual gathering in 2023, with the final outcome presented for consideration at the 2024 WHA.\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel, who first got the ball rolling on a pandemic treaty, said: \u201cI hope we will make history. The situation in the world demands it.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s informal agreement is a huge step, and now it\u2019s time to capitalise on this momentum to make the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel called for reform of how countries fund the WHO so it can react more flexibly to crises.\n\n\u201cMeasures for better prevention and response to pandemics should be laid down in a pandemic treaty, binding under international law,\u201d she said.\n\nSwiss Health Minister Alain Berset said the world needed to take immediate, bold action, as he called for a legally-binding instrument.\n\n\u201cThe issues at stake are too important. We don\u2019t have the right to fail,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria VP Osinbajo Inaugurates N13bn Delta Secretariat Complex, IPP Project",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Monday inaugurated the multi-billion naira Delta State Secretariat Complex named after the Asaba monarch, H.R.M, Prof. Chike Edozien.\n\nThe vice president described the Civil Service as the arrowhead of government at any level.\n\nOsinbajo also described Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as a visionary leader and commended his administration for building such a worthy monument to enhance efficiency in the public service and for naming the state-of-the-art edifice, which would house 27 state ministries, after Nigeria\u2019s oldest professor and reigning monarch, Edozien.\n\nAlso, the vice-president inaugurated the Asaba IPP (independent power project) established under a joint partnership with the Delta State Government and Bestanchury Power Solutions Nigeria Limited and Africa Plus Partners.\n\n\u201cThis is historic indeed, because the seat of the civil service of any arm of government anywhere in the world is usually one of the major monuments enshrining not just the power but also the splendour of the authority of government.\n\n\u201cThis imposing complex clearly meets this requirement. In due course, touch builders become historical monuments and the commissioning of this secretariat is special in two different ways. First the civil service and the people of Delta are today being presented with the state of the art functional and befitting secretariat after many years.\n\n\u201cThis is worthy of great celebration, but beyond that is the fact that it is, at the same time, immortalising one of the Nigeria\u2019s most illustrious sons, HRM Chike Edozien, the Asagba of Asaba, Nigeria\u2019s oldest living professor in any discipline and an internationally renowned professor of medicine.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMore importantly, he is an outstanding bridge-builder and patriot. He has played, and continues to play, an important role as a symbol of unity in the state.\n\n\u201cDuring his 30-year reign thus far, Asaba has changed dramatically, becoming the capital of the newly created Delta State in 1991, and has attracted people from far and wide that have come to seek their fortunes here.\n\n\u201cHis traditional leadership has ensured that the growth and increasing diversity of Asaba has proceeded without tension and antagonism among those who live here.\n\n\u201cI believe that naming this building after Asagba, you are not just celebrating a highly respected deserving son of Delta State and Nigeria, you are also signalling a sort of excellence in public service that we wish to see incubated in this complex.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, more importantly you are saying to a generation that is not even old enough to be employed into the service that integrity, diligence and service to community still pay. It is my hope that this place will be a symbol of unity and distinction.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said he was delighted that Okowa has demonstrated responsible and visionary leadership in that his administration has consistently defied the economic downturn that had put much pressure on financial resources at all levels of government in Nigeria, executing worthy projects.\n\n\u201cThere is more for which Okowa deserves commendation. Despite dwindling revenue receipt and severe resource constraints across all levels of government, he has been able to provide funding for this project.\n\n\u201cAlso your recognition of the critical role of the public sector is notable, whether we are talking about a need for a more Internally Generated Revenue and greater tax efficiency, compensation for resource deficit or the management of the public health crisis such as the pandemic or even the drive for a more IGR, it is the capacity of the public sector that is invariably an issue,\u201d he added.\n\nWelcoming the vice-president and the many personages and people, including the Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri; Deputy Governor of Edo State, Mr. Philip Shuaibu, Okowa thanked Osinbajo for his support and encouragement.\n\nOkowa said, \u201cBy now, many people will probably be wondering if the Vice-President has Delta roots. We have lost count of the number of times he has been here on official engagements.\n\n\u201cI stand here today feeling very proud of this legacy project. Indeed, I am filled with a great sense of joy, satisfaction, fulfilment, and triumph. It was an arduous journey from the time construction commenced on November 27, 2017, to this momentous occasion. As you would expect, constructing an edifice like this would task the ingenuity, resources, and patience of any government in the times we live in.\n\n\u201cIt was quite demanding and exacting, and there were times we were tempted to throw up our hands in despair, and even questioned the wisdom for embarking on a project of this magnitude. The turbulence that has plagued the economy since 2017 was worsened with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing major financial disruptions during the construction process.\n\n\u201cWith the ministries in one central location, the state government will be saving hundreds of millions of naira that was spent annually in renting offices all over the capital city. Coordination and synergy among MDAs would be enhanced, leading to higher morale, better time management, efficiency, and greater productivity.\n\n\u201cThis sprawling office complex occupies a total floor space of 45, 000 square metres. It is designed around five clusters with multiple floors, each cluster around a courtyard. This concept allows plenty of natural light and ventilation into the offices.\n\n\u201cAll the 27 ministries and their commissioners and permanent secretaries will be housed here, with the entire secretariat interconnected through a system of voice and data networks.\u201d\n\nOmon-Julius Onabu in Asaba",

          "text": "A disturbing, hard to watch two minute, eight seconds video of how the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the security wing of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), celebrated the abduction and beheading of two out of three police officers, has surfaced online, causing shock and disbelief across the social space.\n\nThe repulsive video featured some young men, believed to be IPOB/ESN members, communicating in the Igbo language and surrounding two severed heads of the police officers, placed by a fire they set up as if being roasted, in a remote place.\n\nThe brutish young men, who cannibalised the deceased, clowned and scorned them, even as they repeatedly stated that, one of the two killed looked like a \u201cFulani\u201d from the look of his nose, the third officer was seen sitting on the floor with his fate unknown at the time the video was released.\n\nBut the federal government, which described the development as unacceptable, has vowed to bring to justice, the persons behind the gruesome murder of the two policemen.\n\nAlso, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), on Monday, kicked against alleged plans by President Muhammadu Buhari to succumb to pressure and terminate the on-going trial of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in a statement on Monday, described the abduction of the three policemen and the killing of two of them, in the most horrific, barbaric and cannibalistic manner, as an unacceptable attack against the Nigerian state.\n\nHe condemned the murder of two policemen, warning that those, who carried out the killings, videotaped their heinous act and circulated such would be apprehended and brought to justice.\n\nMohammed identified the officers as ASP Francis Idoko (AP No. 154945); Inspector Emmanuel Akubo (AP No. 222336) and Inspector Rufai Adamu (AP. No. 285009), all serving officers of the Nigeria Police.\n\nAccording to him, they were abducted on November 27, 2021 by members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), acting on the instructions of their leader, Chinonso Okafor, otherwise known as Temple.\n\n\u201dTwo of the officers, Inspectors Akubo and Adamu, were killed in the most gruesome manner and their decapitated bodies videotaped and circulated widely. The leader of the ESN team that killed the two officers is one \u2018Gentle\u2019.\n\n\u201dChinonso Okafor, the most influential commander of ESN in charge of Imo and Anambra States, as well as \u2018Gentle\u2019 and all those who perpetrated the abhorrent act will be made to face swift and sure justice,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile condemning the targeting and killing of security agents under any guise as a direct attack on the state that would not be tolerated, the minister said the continued attacks on security agents and agencies of government by ESN/IPOB ran contrary to calls in certain quarters for a political solution to the IPOB issue.\n\nHe also queried why those making calling for political solution have yet to condemn the appalling murder of serving police officers.\n\nThe minister, however, paid glowing tributes to the officers, who made the supreme sacrifice in the service to their fatherland, as well as all security agents, who were serving the nation to the best of their ability in a most difficult moment.\n\nHe further condoled with the families of the slain officers, praying that God to comfort and strengthen them.\n\nMeanwhile, NEF, while advising President Buhari not to yield to pressure to release Kanu, said granting such request could do more harm to the country.\n\nA group under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, had recently met with the president at the State House, Abuja, where they demanded unconditional release of the IPOB leader.\n\nThe president said their demand for unconditional release of Kanu was a difficult one, but he would consider the request of the respected Igbo leaders.\n\nNEF Kicks against Kanu\u2019s Release\n\nBut the Director of Publicity and Advocacy of NEF, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a statement yesterday said there were no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has carefully studied the request of Igbo Elders for President Muhammadu Buhari to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally. It has also noted President Buhari\u2019s response, which both raised very weighty issues related to the request, and his commitment to consider it.\n\n\u201cThe forum notes that there are no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request, and advises that President Buhari will do serious injury to a country already threatened by multiple challenges to its security and territorial integrity if he delays announcing the only responsible response, which is that the judicial process in the case of Kanu must be allowed to run its course.\u201d\n\nThe forum alluded to a judicial decision to label bandits and kidnappers as terrorists, and recommended greater clarity in terms of the targets of this development.\n\nIt added, \u201cIn any event, the forum cautions against profiling and targeting all Fulani as terrorists. Millions of law-abiding Fulani exist, who should be encouraged to stay on the side of the law, while those who have chosen to continue on the path of criminality should feel the full weight of the law.\u201d\n\nThe forum further advised that the national census planned for 2022 should be postponed until after the 2023 elections. It said the integrity and success of a sensitive and vital activity, such as census, would be compromised by destabilised and threatened communities and proximity to another sensitive activity, general election.\n\nWhile decrying the hardship under which the vast majority of the population lived, the forum noted that the increasing poverty level and widespread insecurity demanded that leaders should exercise extreme caution in taking economic and security-related decisions.\n\nIt stressed that an increase in the price of fuel, in particular, would compound the already desperate condition of living of most Nigerians.\n\nNEF said it was important that decisions on this matter included consideration of the interests of the national economy, welfare of the citizens, and reactions of a hard-pressed citizenry.\n\nKalu\u2019s Visit to Kanu\n\nIn a related development, Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, yesterday, visited Kanu, in the custody of the Department of State Services and advised him to be wary of some of his actions.\n\nKalu, in a statement personally signed, said the IPOB leader was in good health and under proper care.\n\nThe former governor of Abia State, however, noted that he spoke with Kanu as a brother and told him the need to consider the consequences of certain actions that he would be taking.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis afternoon, I visited my brother, Maazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, Abuja. I met him in good health and care and we discussed as \u2018Umunne\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn 2001, when I was Governor, I made his father Eze Israel Okwu Kanu, the traditional ruler of Akwara Ukwu and since then the family has been very close to me.\n\n\u201cI understand that Nnamdi has an insane number of people rooting for him back home and I encouraged him to consider the consequences of certain actions and utterances for the sake of the same people.\n\n\u201cEven though my ideology and his ideology are totally different, God has made us brothers and we can\u2019t run away from each other. I owe him and Nigerians good counselling, whether he and his family listen to me or not. I will continue to counsel him as I have always done in the past. What we need most is a peaceful and secured society.\u201d\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "As countries across the world continued to take measures to prevent the spread of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, Nigeria on Monday said there was currently no reported detection of the strain in the country.\n\nNational COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr. Mukhtar Muhammad, stated this position yesterday in Abuja at a media briefing organised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19.\n\nAddressing journalists, Muhammad stressed that as of yesterday, there had not been any detected case, saying, \u201cthe PSC has continued to review our risk of this latest information and take every necessary step to stop it from being imported into the country. We have taken far-reaching proactive measures to minimise and mitigate this possibility.\u201d\n\nThe discovery last week by South Africa and Botswana of the more infectious variant of COVID-19 elicited global concern.\n\nMuhammad said PSC would be issuing a travel guideline today to prevent the virus from spreading. The new travel guideline will require passengers arriving the country to do a PCR test 48 hours before departing.\n\nThey would also do day two and day seven PCR tests on arrival while they will be required to self-isolate for seven days, he added.\n\nMuhammad explained: \u201cPassengers that are outbound, going out of Nigeria, will be required to either show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or provide a negative PCR test taken 48 hours before departure. These conditions apply to diplomats as well. The measures will come into effect by Friday, 3rd of December, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe Head of Technical Secretariat of PSC said the authority would ensure that there was enforcement on passengers who arrived and refused to take tests, through suspension of their passports and prosecution, or both.\n\nHe added that PSC would step up surveillance at the ports of entry into the country, intensify testing and contact tracing, and optimise sequencing capacity.\n\nMuhammad decried the promotion of vaccine nationalism, a pervasive inequality at the global level that made rich countries to be able to procure vaccines for their own citizens, through direct agreements with pharmaceutical companies, while low and middle countries lagged behind. He said this was one of the factors fuelling COVID-19 and the emergence of variants of concern, including Omicron.\n\nHe warned that lack of vaccination in developing countries would provide a fertile ground for the virus to develop mutations, which will in turn threaten progress already recorded. Muhammad called on the developed countries to support efforts being made globally to ensure that there was equity and access to vaccines.\n\nThe federal government also said it was reviewing the situation around the world and putting in place measures to curtail the effect of the new variant on the country.\n\nSpeaking at the national briefing of the committee, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, PSC on COVID-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha, urged Nigerians to exercise extra caution and vigilance in practice and enforcement of preventive measures.\n\nMustapha stated, \u201cAs the DG WHO has just stated today, the emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is. South Africa and Botswana should be thanked for detecting, sequencing and reporting this variant, not penalised.\u201d\n\nHe said both South Africa and Botswana should be commended for not hiding Omicron but revealing to WHO the outcome of their sequencing.\n\nMustapha warned that other countries might in future choose to maintain silence, in the process putting the world at risk, instead of disclosing discovery of new outbreaks in order not to suffer liabilities, like the ones South Africa and Botswana are suffering.\n\nThe SGF said PSC was aware of some travellers circumventing the travel protocols by providing fake COVID-19 test results, vowing, \u201cThe weight of the law is heavy and will come hard on these people.\u201d\n\nMustapha said under the Vaccine Mandate that would come into effect fully on December 1, 2021, every federal government worker and, in essence, all Nigerians and residents were expected to get vaccination.\n\nHe added: \u201cWith the developments around the world, people will not be able to travel without their verified vaccination cards.\u201d\n\nThe SGF also said the impasse on the Nigeria-UAE flights had been resolved in the interest of both parties. He said though this process had taken so long to pull through, with its ripple effects, everyone involved in getting the deal deserved plaudits.\n\n\u201cA date for the commencement of flights between the two countries will be announced in due course,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SGF also said PSC\u2019s nine months mandate extension would end on December 31. He said to effectively capture the core elements of the national response, a National Summit to end COVID-19 in 2022 and to strengthen Global Health Security was being planned to hold in Abuja 6-7 December.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\n",

IATF 2021 was enormously successful at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe $42.1 billion in trade and investment deals that were generated reflected the record participation, a well-thought-out platform, diversity and depth of goods and services showcased and a rich programme.\n\n\u201cWe thank the African Union Commission and the AfCFTA Secretariat, the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government as well as our other partner institutions, donors, exhibitors, buyers and performers for their strong collaboration,\u201d Oramah said.",
