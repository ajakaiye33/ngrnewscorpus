          "title": "2023 Elections: We\u2018re ready to support police to ensure free peaceful elections \u2013 CDS, General Irabor",
          "text": "By Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor has advised Politicians seeking for elective offices and those jostling for appointive positions in the 2023 general elections to ensure they do so within the ambit of the provisions of the law, warning, \u201cWe (Security Agencies) will not in any way, stand aside and see anyone perpetrating violence, all because they are looking for political office and allow it\u201d.\n\nAddressing the media on Thursday, the CDS said, \u201cWe will not allow criminals amongst those or if you like thugs that might make themselves available for anyone to use, to perpetrate violence. We will not allow it. And we\u2019re working very closely with the police. We are ready to give them all the support that is necessary, because going forward with this, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking forward to the media as an ally to work as partners to ensure peaceful elections\u201d.\n\nContinuing he said, \u201cNow we\u2019re going to a season that everyone is desiring and to have a peaceful election, peaceful campaigns. We will ensure that we have a peaceful period, with the incoming election, so that every one of us will have a country we will be proud of. We must be men or women that conduct ourselves peacefully. And I need your spreadsheet to drive this message to everyone.\n\nSpeaking on operational matters, the CDS disclosed that issues of moles/saboteurs in the military whose activities have impacted negatively on troops and equipment, are being tacked with all the seriousness it deserves with several military court martials going on both in the theatres of operation and even in Military locations in Abuja to punish saboteurs.\n\nHis words, \u201cThere will always be bad eggs. And I feel that so bad. I\u2019ve also been one of those most disturbed about this the few times we have discovered this evil and put the culprits to trial. They were not reported to us. We discovered them. We discovered that if we didn\u2019t have measures to discover like having internet platforms, we would not have met these important objective\n\n\u201cThis is why many of you when you talk about human rights, you get it misplaced, especially when you are dealing with people that are armed forces. There are internal mechanisms. If you\u2019re in the armed forces, you operate within the ambit of the service rules. Your understanding of what human rights is, if we follow it, then of course, there will be no armed force, a discipline armed forces.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if I if I ask you (media men) to remain here, from now till evening, you will you will revolt. But if I tell these gentlemen (military personnel) to remain here from 9.30am till tomorrow morning, they will have no reason to stand up because they trust that for me to give that instruction, there\u2019s a basis for it. So it\u2019s on that basis that I like to inform you that we have internal mechanism to repress issues that have to do with moles and we\u2019re dealing with them.\n\nCommenting on the challenges troops were having with improvised explosive devices planted by terrorist elements and which hinders troops movements in battle areas, the CDS said, \u201cWe have been exposed to several demonstrations on equipment available to neutralize and deactivate IEDS. There is no equipment that is 100 per cent complete for detecting improvised explosive devices in the market, that has been assessed to be effective that we do not have now. It is one thing to claim that an equipment can do something.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different thing for you to now confirm whether other people can actually do it. So what I believe is that in general, we equipment IED detectors that we\u2019re using. But if it\u2019s not as effective as you wish, we work towards having it. It would be wrong information to say that most modern equipment that are available they are not provided for them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not correct. I was also a victim of it but I didn\u2019t I went of course. What was provided is what we\u2019re able to get in the market which was accessed to be the best by the presenter. But of course, when we began using it in operation, it became a problem in itself why? What it does is that it will destroy the IED but it does not end there. It will also dig a massive crater that now makes it almost impossible for troops to move across and pursue the terrorists.\n\n\u201cTo achieve our operational objective, of course is first to deactivate improvised explosive devices, and to go to attack the objective. But if the men who are to go to attack the enemy cannot move by virtue of the obstacle that has been created, then of course we have an issue. As I speak with you that equipment, we\u2019re thinking on what to do with it. We have also made some ingenious creations to be able to see how we can beat that.\n\nMeanwhile, the Director of Defence Media Operations, Major General Bernard Onyeuko disclosed also on Thursday that the Joint Task Force of Operation Delta Safe in efforts at eliminating illegal oil activities through Subsidiary Operation Octopus Grip, in the last 7 weeks of it operations in April discovered and destroyed 337 illegal oil refineries, 1,052 metal storage tanks, 515 ovens, 68 wooden boats.

          "text": "By Chinonso Alozie\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Friday warned the rampaging criminal gangs in the South East region that their days are numbered, just as IPOB vowed to apprehend the hoodlums.\n\nIPOB\u2019s lead counsel Ifeanyi Ejiofor while speaking with newsmen in Owerri gave this warning after they visited Nnamdi Kanu at the detention facility of the Department of State Services, DSS, in Abuja, last Thursday.\n\nThey described the action of the hoodlums as sacrilegious and an attempt to label IPOB a bad group. Also, the group urged the residents to continue to expose them and their activities for sanity to return to the zone.\n\nAccording to IPOB, lead legal team, \u201cConsistent with the prevailing Court-Order, Our team of lawyers conducted today\u2019s routine visit to our indefatigable Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (Ohamadike Ndi Igbo).Onyewuu was briefed on the positions of all pending legal actions instituted on his behalf, as well as those we are defending across all courts, including our yesterday\u2019s superlative outing in Ebonyi State High Court.\n\n\u201cOnyendu was particularly enthused with our legal prowess and extraordinary feats so far recorded. He reminded us that our professional services in this regard, especially those directed towards rescuing UmuChineke entrapped in various detention facilities across all the states is a divine mandate, which will be remembered by posterity.\n\n\u201cAll strategies towards a successful outing, come 28th June 2022, were comprehensively reviewed, and it is our conviction that there shall be Victory, come 28th June 2022.\n\n\u201cOnyendu was also briefed on the level of compliance with his directive for total sanity on our land, which is yielding the desired result. The community efforts of our people who have taken it upon themselves to confront these criminal gangs/evil elements desecrating our land, and the extraordinary feats being recorded in these volunteer services were equally shared.\n\n\u201cOnyendu insists that every form of crime and criminality in our land must be completely eradicated, and proceeded to urge our people never to relent in fishing out the criminal elements, who are mainly strangers on our land. Onyendu commended UmuChineke for their peaceful conduct and resoluteness. The efforts of those aggressively working towards the bad labelling of his peaceful movement have come to halt. The facts speak for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe seized the opportunity offered by the visit to brief Onyendu of the barbaric act of the criminal gangs who kidnapped my Aunty a week ago, and her subsequent release.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that the criminal gangs, who engaged in this sacrilegious act, in active connivance with some locals have nothing to do with IPOB. They are pure criminals who would soon be apprehended. To this end, Onyendu declared that the days of these monsters are numbered. Nevertheless, we continue to thank the highest God for the gift of life.\n\n\u201cOnyendu reiterated his confidence in the ability of those who are steering this ship on his behalf, particularly in restoring total calm and sanity on our land, which is in line with the ideology of his peaceful Movement. He remains profoundly grateful,\u201d IPOB said.",

Leke Abejide has set tongues wagging after he shared a screenshot of his monthly salary on a Channels Television live program monitored by The Nation.\n\nIn the screenshot seen by The Nation, Abejide earns about N697,911 monthly as a Reps member.\n\nThe pay package of public office holders, particularly the salaries and allowances of the National Assembly members, has been an issue of concern among Nigerians.\n\nHe however did not provide evidence for allowances and constituency projects.\n\nThe lawmaker said most of the funds were spent on constituents\u2019 high demands.\n\nAbejide maintained that being a lawmaker was not lucrative as his constituents expect him to provide for their special needs too.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe allowances you talk about \u2013 I have staff, then people in the constituency are also there waiting for me. In a month, I don\u2019t think I have up to N1.5 million. And I have family to take care of.\n\n\u201cSo if you are coming to this system and you are someone who has been working on your own and doing business, you will not like to continue. Because the demand that is coming from your constituency in a month is in the range of N30 to N40 million.\n\n\u201cSomeone whose children wants to go to school, to hospital, somebody who wants to do marriage, it is only you they will be focusing on. They can\u2019t get the Governor; you are the closest person to them. And if you don\u2019t do for them, then you have not done anything. So that\u2019s the danger in this assembly.\n\n\u201cIf you are not a man of means and you come to this seat, in one year people will be stoning you.\n\n\u201cThe only difference is constituency project. Mine is N113 million a year. And out of it, government will take 18.5 percent.\u201d",

Skills open the doors to financial opportunities Click here to learn it .\n\nFrom Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nAmidst tears and gnashing of teeth, the remains of the 44 victims of the attack on the St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State were on Friday committed to the mother\u2019s earth.\n\nThe Catholic diocese of Ondo and the state government had organized mass burial for the victims of the penultimate Sunday attack on the church and the funeral mass was witnessed by government functionaries including the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, his wife, Betty, the Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye and former Governor of the state, Dr Olusegun Mimiko among other top officials of the state government.\n\nCatholic clerics including Archbishop of Ibadan archdiocese, Most Rev Leke Abegunrin, Bishop of the diocese of Sokoto, Mathew Hassan Kukah, Bishop of Oyo diocese, Leke Badejo and those of Osogbo, Ado-Ekiti, Abeokuta, ijebu-Ode and other dioceses of the church in the South West also graced the occasion.\n\nIn his homily, the Catholic Bishop of Oyo diocese, Bishop Leke Badejo said though the victims were dead, they remain save in the hands of Jesus, their saviour.\n\nHe stressed the need for all Christians to embrace self defense, which he said it\u2019s allowed in the doctrine of the Catholic Church, as according to him the government can no longer provide the needed security for the citizenry.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to wake up from its slumber, just as he asked rhetorically if lives still have value to the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cIs Bokoharam more powerful than our government? Are bandits and terrorists more powerful than our Federal Government? I don\u2019t think so, but recent events have shown that our government can not secure us again,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, almost 900 Nigerians were killed in violent attacks in different parts of the country in 2022 alone.\n\nThe cleric expressed worry on the spate of attack against Christians in the country, saying that \u201cby being christians, are we now walking corpses? No, we are not walking corpses that our leaders want us to think we are. Our leaders must therefore be leaders indeed and not mere dealers.\u201d\n\nHe said the killing was not an isolated one and there is no indication that it would be the last one, stressing that those in position of authority have shown nothing to show that the attack on the church of God will abate.\n\nHowever, Bishop Badejo urged christians not to succumb to the threat and challenges against the church by the tragedy of the present time.\n\nSpeaking, Governor Akeredolu said he was at the occasion to accept the failure of government on security, saying \u201cwe have failed, we have failed. We have really failed you.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said \u201cNot that we are not trying as a government, but the forces of the other side has overpowered us. The forces of the other side have proved that we have not done anything. However, we shall not allow the situation to continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not here that I will begin to speak about the failures of the government. It is not here that I will speak about the short comings of the government. This is quite unfortunate but we will countinue to rely on Good. The security architecture of this country needs rejigging but we are not here for that. We will say that somewhere else,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe Governor affirmed that 40 persons were killed during the attack on the church on June 5, while over 70 persons were badly injured.\n\nHe said out of the 40 people, 18 had been buried by their various families, while the remaining 22 people were being buried by the church.\n\nThe Catholic Bishop of Ondo diocese, Bishop Jude Arogundade said the Ondo State Governor, Mr Akeredolu has not failed but he has shown courage and bravery.\n\nHe said the promise given by the government to find the killers was an empty promise, which would not yield any positive result.\n\nHe expressed concern on the inability of the government to introduce state police which operates in other advanced climes, just as he maintained that \u201cwe shall continue to hold our leaders responsible.\u201d\n\nHe however called on those who perpetrated the dasterdly act to repent and be saved, saying that \u201cthe killers should tell us their grievance. They should tell us why they are angry and what they want.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nCrisis is brewing in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) following the nomination of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the opposition party\u2019s vice presidential candidate for the 2023 general election.\n\nFormer vice president and PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, announced Okowa as running mate at a meeting of the national caucus at the PDP national Secretariat, in Abuja.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAtiku said his choice was informed by Okowa\u2019s antecedent as former member of the National Assembly, two-term governor and appreciation of the dire strait the country was facing. He, however, said others recommended for the vice presidential slot \u2013 Governors Nyesom Wike and Udom Emmanuel of Rivers and Akwa Ibom states respectively \u2013 were eminently qualified, noting that only one person could have been chosen for the job.\n\n\u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom. In these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cThe wise men and sages of the party put together by our NWC have gone fishing and brought home an enviable group of awesome politicians that surpasses these qualities. Every one of the recommended persons is a fit and proper individual to hold this office. While this makes me marvel at the bundle of talents that abounds in our party, it also compounded my task of choosing a single person from among them\u2026\n\n\u201cI know that he (Okowa) will not only add excitement to our already energised ticket and campaign but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023. I am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of running mate who will help to lead us to victory next year, not only in the presidential election, but also in the governorship and legislative elections. And he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country.\u201d\n\nHowever, Daily Sun gathered that Okowa\u2019s choice has not gone down well with several party leaders, including governors and critical stakeholders. Mostly irked are supporters of Governor Nyesom Wike, who was originally tipped for the position.\n\nOkowa\u2019s emergence, it was learnt, also deepened the schism in the PDP Governors Forum, which had been polarised over who would be the vice presidential candidate.\n\nWhile Governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Okezie Ikpeazu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Ahmadu Fintiri and Samuel Ortom of Abia, Enugu, Adamawa and Benue states respectively, pushed for Wike, Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Taraba Governor, Darius Ishaku and Godwin Obaseki of Edo championed Okowa\u2019s course.\n\nThe division became glaring, yesterday, as only Obaseki, Bala Mohammed and Udom were present at the caucus meeting where Okowa was unveiled. Makinde, Ortom, Ikpeazu, Fintiri, Ugwuanyi and Wike were absent. Enugu governor, who showed up at the PDP secretariat left before the commencement of the meeting. Some NWC members including the National Vice Chairman (South South), Dan Orbih, were also absent.\n\nThe division, it was learnt, might not be unconnected with the result that came out of Tuesday\u2019s meeting from the special panel set up to shop for Atiku\u2019s running mate where 13 members voted in favour of the Rivers governors as opposed to three that voted for Okowa.It was learnt that those who supported Wike, especially among the governors, were vexed by the eventual choice of Okowa who came a distant second.\n\nDaily Sun, however, gathered that the pendulum tilted in favour of Okowa on Wednesday night, following the intervention of some northern leaders, among them a member of the NWC, who kicked against the choice of Wike, alleging he was anti-north.\n\nA top party source told Daily Sun that some of the grouse listed against Wike included alleged past anti-north speeches, move to domicile Value Added Tax (VAT) collection in Rivers State perceived to hold dire consequences for northern states\u2019 economy, alleged intolerance of Islam, among others.\n\nWike was also perceived as a hardliner as opposed to a more malleable Okowa who will work better with Atiku to achieve his goals.\n\nPDP chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, however, dismissed reports that the panel voted in favour of a particular person.\n\n\u201cThe committee recommended three names to us and we transmitted those three names to the candidate. Contrary to all the speculations in the social media, the NWC did not select one name for the candidate. The choice of running mate, who will be working with him is largely his. But he graciously consulted the party, which is how it should be. And the party has made inputs and narrowed it down to three people for him to select. \u201cAlso, I want to clarify one misrepresentation in the social media. The committee did not vote throughout its sitting. It was all by consensus.\u201d\n\n\u2022I\u2019ll stay loyal, says Okowa\n\nSpeaking after being named, Okowa said he would remain loyal and committed to the goal of the party to return to power.He said winning the 2023 presidential election would require great work and asked for support and commitment of party members to the cause of winning the general election.\n\n\u201cI want to pledge that I will stay loyal and committed to this battle and it\u2019s a battle God has a hand in. There is no doubt that there is a great work ahead for each and every one of us. The build-back process is going to be collective and we\u2019re trusting that all our party members would want to be part of that story at the end of the day.\n\nOkowa had while addressing journalists after appearing before the vice presidential screening committee, said Wike would not be disappointed with his emergence.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike is a very strong party man. He has great love for our party, and I believe he is also a good democrat and he understands that when several brothers are in the race for a particular position, it has to be one at a point in time. I want to assure you that Governor Wike is a very good man and his interest for this country and party to rise up to the challenges at the moment is strong.

He said: \u201cThe current spate of insecurity in the country leaves us with no room for equivocation on the right of the states to maintain law and order through the establishment of State Police.\n\n\u201cThe growing distrust in the polity is a direct result of the disconnect between the federal government and the constituent units of the country.\n\n\u201cThe economic adversity, currently experienced in the country, points directly at the defective political structure.\n\n\u201cA unitary system cannot work successfully, in a country like Nigeria. The 1999 Constitution has been amended twice. There is another promise of further amendments arising from the manifest irregularity in many provisions.\n\n\u201cThis has compelled many lawyers and educated citizens to insist on having a new Constitution which will reflect the agitations of the various groups which make up the country.\n\n\u201cThe law is becoming increasingly less certain under these circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe crises created by the 1999 Constitution, as amended, have been unending. There have been agitations that the Exclusive Legislative List in this Constitution is limited to Nigeria\u2019s external trade, customs duties, export duties, tax on incomes, profits and capital gains, interstate commerce, external borrowing, mining rents and royalties from mineral resources, among others.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has, consistently, rejected this suggestion, presumably, because of the humongous 52% revenue allocation to it, while the 36 States and the 774 local governments share the remaining 48%,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAkeredolu further challenged states to restructure the country by, among others, setting up their anti-graft agencies.\n\nHowever, in his address at the event, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), said governors cannot continue to agitate for restructuring and state police when they are responsible for the compromise and mismanagement of the current system.\n\nHe said that state governors, who have taken over the allocations of local government in their states, have no moral right to ask for restructuring.\n\nMalami also stated that \u201cstate police will not work because state governors would abuse it; look at the way they treat local government, imagine what will happen if they control the police.\u201d\n\nThe AGF advised the governors to utilise the existing structures through the National Assembly, to press on with their demands for restructuring and other constitutional amendments.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "title": "PDP Governors, Others Hail as Atiku Names Okowa Running Mate",
          "text": "\n\n*Ex-VP says he\u2019s not afraid of taking difficult decisions, donates N10m to Owo victims\n\n*Our candidate has solutions to Nigeria\u2019s challenges, Delta gov posits\n\n*Party plans to offer Wike campaign DG and prominent role in govt if they win\n\nChuks Okocha, Sunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former vice-president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has continued to receive commendations from far and near, over his choice of the Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nProminent amongst those, who had hailed Atiku over his choice partner were the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum led by the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; the Chairman, PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jubrin; former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu and Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Ndidu Elumelu, among others.\n\n\n\nAtiku had, 24 hours to deadline set for the submission of names of presidential candidates and their deputies by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), announced Okowa, as his running mate.\n\n\n\nThe main opposition party, had been back and forth on the choice of its running mate since its presidential convention on May 28, including setting up advisory committees to assist on the choice of the most suitable candidate, and further delayed till 24 hours before the INEC deadline.\n\n\n\nHowever, unknown to many, the choice of running mate is a decision the presidential candidate of any party alone, is constitutionally empowered to make and not of anyone else as clearly spelt out in section 142 ( 1) of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\n\n\nThe section states thus: \u201cIn any election to which the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Chapter relate, a candidate for an election to the office of President shall not be deemed to be validly nominated unless he nominates another candidate as his associate from the same political party for his running for the office of President, who is to occupy the office of Vice-President and that candidate shall be deemed to have been duly elected to the office of Vice-President if the candidate for an election to the office of President, who nominated him as such associate is duly elected as President in accordance with the provisions aforesaid.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, therefore, exercised this power and right, although after comprehensively consulting with other stakeholders such as the NWC, BoT, founding fathers, elders of the party to ensure that all of them were carried along, before finally settling for the Delta State governor, yesterday.\n\n\n\nHowever, sources close to the Atiku campaign informed THISDAY yesterday that, the party plans to offer Wike, who came second in the primary and was one of the top contenders for the postion of VP, the Director General of the Atiku campaign and also a very promient role in the government if they win the election in 2023.\n\n\n\nAtiku, who at the unveiling of Okowa as his partner on the presidential journey, boasted that he was never afraid of taking difficult decisions, also donated the sum of N10 million to victims of the recent attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Okowa, while accepting his nomination, claimed Atiku, had solutions to the numerous challenges bedeviling the country.\n\nReacting to the development, while Ayu, said Okowa was chosen on merit, Jubrin, also described the choice of Okowa as an act of God.\n\n\n\nAddressing party members, Atiku, said with the convention behind the party, \u201cWe have arrived at the stage for me to pick a running mate, because this is a joint ticket. I am very happy to announce today that I have reached a decision on that.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom. In these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be president. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot, which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understand the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understand the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe person must appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalised world.\n\n\u201cMy running mate must understand that without security, development will be very difficult, because local and foreign investors, who have been scared away already, would not return to invest in our economy. Thus, my running mate will be a person, who will stand by me as I confront the frightening level of insecurity in our land.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you know, the APC government went to sleep as huge swathes of our country\u2019s territory fell into the deadly hands of gangs of criminals, including those masquerading as freedom fighters or pastoralists, while our farmers and genuine pastoralists are unable to go about their businesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe costs in precious human lives and properties have been enormous. My running mate must also not only symbolise the imperative of reuniting our country but also be able to work with me to achieve that objective. This is because a united Nigeria is a potentially stronger, more prosperous, and more secure country able to lead Africa and give hope to the Black race.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn addition, my running mate has to be someone, who is not afraid to speak his mind and give honest advice, and, be by my side as I work very hard to reverse the destructive impact of the past seven years of the APC government.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP candidate explained that in the United States of America from where Nigeria borrowed key aspects of current presidential system, \u201ca running mate is used to balance the ticket, complement the candidate and, after victory, assist the president with governance. Sometimes a candidate is chosen, who generates a buzz and adds huge excitement to the campaign.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut, today in Nigeria, we face huge challenges, which leave us little room for drama. We have to win the elections and get to work immediately. My running mate has to be ready to start working with me, from day one, in addressing our country\u2019s challenges. Nigerians will not accept anything less.\n\n\u201cThat is why I promised the governors of our party that my running mate will come from among them. Our current challenges call for a government that is highly focused and disciplined.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have sought the support, guidance, and counsel of the PDP in selecting a befitting running mate, who meets all or most of the qualities enumerated above. The wisemen and sages of the party, put together by our NWC, have gone fishing and brought home an enviable group of awesome politicians that surpasses these qualities.\n\n\u201cEveryone of the recommended persons is a fit and proper individual to hold this office. While this makes me marvel at the bundle of talents that abounds in our party, it also compounded my task of choosing a single person from among them.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me, therefore, pay tribute to my party and, most especially, to all those that made the shortlist that must now be narrowed down to a single person. They are all dedicated party-men suitable for this task. I wish all the recommended persons could be announced today as my running mates. Unfortunately, only one MUST be chosen.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult decision that I am called upon to take. But, as someone hoping to lead a complex country such as ours, tough and difficult decisions would remain a part of my everyday life. Let me, therefore, start this momentous journey with a crucial decision about who, among the eminently qualified shortlist, would be my running mate.\n\n\n\n\u201cAccordingly, let me state that the person I have chosen as my running mate possesses all those identified qualities. He personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for our country but also the future that our young people yearn for and deserve. He is a serving state governor, who has demonstrated, in his state and through his conduct, that governance is about service to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know that he will not only add excitement to our already energised ticket and campaign, but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023. I am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of running mate, who will help to lead us to victory next year not only in the presidential election but also in the governorship and legislative elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country. He has both legislative and executive experiences. Please, join me in welcoming to the ticket, the next vice-president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know him to be a fighter; you know him to care about winning; you know him to care about good governance; and you know him to care about our people. Now, my dear friends, let\u2019s do the disciplined hard work necessary to win this election. Let\u2019s go. Thank very much.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking on party unity, Atiku said, \u201cParty unity is critical not only for us to prosecute a winning campaign but also to provide good governance that our country seriously deserves and our people earnestly yearn for. The task of winning the coming elections will be a tough one and we must not take anything for granted.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccepting his nomination, Okowa said, \u201cFirst, I must give thanks to God for this day and I want to appreciate the party for having a very successful convention. And I thank the national chairman and his team and the chairman of the convention committee for giving us a convention that everybody could definitely say two or three are fair. And we came out more united than people ever thought.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to thank you, sir, for all that you\u2019ve done through this very period. I thank God that you were able with your team, the National Working Committee, to steer the party through this period, and we have produced a very experienced candidate, who can take back Nigeria in our rescue missions. I\u2019m sure that we will be able to begin the rebuilding process of this nation right from May 29 2023. We must thank God for that.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. President-in-waiting, I must truly thank you for finding me worthy to be on this ticket. I do know that it was a very tough decision, even as you have spoken this afternoon. But I thank God that amongst my very qualified colleagues, even those more qualified than myself, that I found favour and I\u2019m here today as the vice-presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile thanking you, I do understand that it\u2019s a great work that is ahead of us. By the special grace of God, we will work hard to ensure victory for the party. There is no doubt that there is a great work ahead of each and every one of us.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe building back process is going to be collective and we\u2019re trusting that all of our team members will want to be part of that story at the end of the day. The story which will obviously be positive and will yield positive results, will require that each and every one of us must support our principle as we move forth in the next few months, and that at the end, we will win the elections with a landslide victory.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we must create in ourselves, in yourself, a new approach to political issues, a new commitment, which I believe we all yearn for. It will require a lot of commitment from each and every one of us. It will require the unity of each and everyone of us in our various wards, in our various local governments and states. We need the PDP to return to power.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have answers to the questions because I\u2019ve had the opportunity of going through our candidates book, and I hope each and every one of us will take time to go through \u2018My Covenant with Nigeria\u2019. It is something worth studying. It is something put together, which I don\u2019t think, other presidential candidates of other parties have not been able to put together. You need to go through it. You will find the solutions to our problems in that document. I also appreciate our presidential candidate publicly for making this happen earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cBased on social media reports that he has taken time to understudy, because of the experience that he has had in the past, he has been able to prepare solutions. I believe that we will definitely by the special grace of God, we go for the elections, we will wins landslide. I am very happy to be on this tickets.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am sure by the special grace of God with the national chairman leading us, it should be well with our party. Please, let\u2019s join hands together to walk with our principal to ensure that we win the elections landslide once again. I want to thank Mr. President-in-waiting for finding me worthy to be on the tickets. I want to thank the party for accepting that I be on this ticket,\u201d Okowa stated.\n\n\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, explained that, Atiku wrote NWC to help help choose a presidential running mate, adding that upon the receipt of the letter, he set up a 17-man committee headed by the Deputy National Chairman, Ambassador Umar Damagun, and a decision reached was transmitted to Atiku.\n\nThe PDP chairman, who denounced claims that, \u201cNo voting took place when they met,\u201d stated that the selected committee reached their decision based on consensus and the presidential running mate was chosen based on own merit and criteria as the NWC has no inputs at all.\n\n\n\nThe occasion was witnessed by the Governors of Edo, Godwin Obaseki, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, among others, including all members of PDP leadership.\n\nThereafter, Okowa went for screening before the Tom Ikimi-led committee, which gave the Delta governor a pass mark.\n\n\n\nJubrin, who described the choice of Okowa as an act of God, said in a statement that, \u201cthis decision must be generally accepted as the act God, who gives life to who He wants and takes away life from who He wants. He has bounties unlimited.\u201d\n\nUrging all PDP members to accept this decision in good faith and give the strongest support to Atiku as President of Nigeria and Okowa as his vice-president, he said, \u201cBoth Muslims and Christians must come together to give support to them all.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll PDP members must come together to unite for PDP to take over from APC Government of Buhari. All Muslims and Christians must come together and forget any religious differences and regard Nigeria as one entity. All Nigerians should vote for PDP to ensure that Atiku and Okowa are fully accepted and voted for,\u201d he stated.\n\nPDP Governors Forum Congratulates Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa on VP Selection\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party Governors Forum (PDP-GF) yesterday congratulated the Governor of Delta State, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 General elections.\n\n\n\nIn a statement signed late yesterday by the chairman PDP Governors Forum. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal noted in particular that the PDP Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, promised to select a serving PDP Governor as his running mate, ostensibly not just because of the contributions of the Governors to the effective running of the Party and its stability, but because of their experience and executive capacity. He kept his word.\n\n\n\nHe said that Governor Okowa has distinguished himself as Governor of Delta State, stating that he also has cognate legislative experience as a former Senator as well as what it takes to be an effective Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nTambuwal said \u2018 the great task of recovering, rescuing and rebuilding Nigeria begins with the Atiku / Okowa ticket. The APC has completely messed up Nigeria. It has failed in all aspects of governance; insecurity, bad economy, dysfunctional education, health and social services are the hallmarks of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cWith the Atiku/Okowa ticket help is on the way. We shall overcome\u201d the chairman of the PDP Governors said.\n\nObaseki, Secondus, Ekweremadu, Elumelu Congratulate Okowa\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, former national chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, and House of Representatives Minority Leader, Ndidu Elumelu, have congratulated the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the running mate to the candidate of the PDP in the 2023 presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nObaseki, in a statement, said Okowa\u2019s emergence would translate to victory for the party in the forthcoming elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you, my friend and brother, His Excellency, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa on your emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\n\n\n\n\u201cAn energetic grassroots mobiliser, Okowa, a two-time governor, senator and commissioner, has the needed experience that would guarantee victory for our party in 2023 elections in our bid to rescue the country and place it on the path of progress and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we embark on this all-important mission to rescue Nigeria, we must now all work together in unity, as a people and party, to reclaim our country.\u201d\n\n\n\nSecondus, in a statement from his media office, commended the duo for the maturity they brought into the contest, which must have been responsible for their eventual victory.\n\n\n\nHe described Atiku as a square peg in a square hole, whose pedigree in the nation\u2019s political space remains outstanding and speaks for itself, adding that his choice of Okowa as running mate said it all about his knack for picking good heads to be around him for the gargantuan task ahead.\n\n\n\nHe however, said with the picking of a running mate, the candidacy was complete and PDP was now set for the inevitable journey back to Aso Rock come 2023.\n\nEkweremadu, in a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, also described Okowa as highly resourceful and prepared for the office of the Vice President.\n\n\n\nHe commended the party and its presidential candidate, Atiku for the decision, while calling on all party leaders and faithful to go to work to ensure the success of the ticket at the presidential polls.\n\n\u201cI join our party leaders, party faithful, and supporters in congratulating my brother and friend, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of our great party, the PDP.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a sound choice by our presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and our party. No doubt, Okowa brings immense electoral value to the PDP ticket. He is highly resourceful and he is prepared for the Office of the VP. I urge every party leader and member to now go to work to ensure the success of the ticket at the 2023 polls,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nElumelu, in a statement, said Okowa\u2019s confirmation as running mate was no doubt informed by the confidence and trust reposed in him by Atiku, other PDP leaders and supporters of the party across the nation.\n\nHe, therefore, expressed optimism that with Abubakar leading the charge, and Okowa by his side, the PDP was sure of victory in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you, Your Excellency, Sen. Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, the humble, hardworking and down to earth Governor of Delta State, on your emergence as the Vice-Presidential Candidate of our great party the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have again brought honour and pride to our dear state, Delta, where you have demonstrated uncommon commitment as evinced in your unprecedented achievements in all sectors and we assure you and His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, of our unalloyed and unwavering support for the task ahead.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Atiku Abubakar is a statesman par excellence, a brilliant administrator, remarkably committed and competent leader, a unifier and detribalized Nigerian, who has exceptionally deep understanding of the challenges of our nation and the solutions thereto.\n\n\n\n\u201cImportantly sir, as a leader, particularly, as the Chairman of the South South Governors\u2019 Forum, I earnestly urge you to use your emergence to immediately initiate processes that will lead to peaceful reconciliations and calming of all frayed nerves including some leaders, who may feel sidelined or scorned in the process of nominating the vice-presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022PDP screens vice-presidential nominees today\n\n\u2022Party\u2019s NWC meets over c\u2019ttee\u2019s recommendations on running mate\n\n\u2022Atiku speaks on how to free up funds for social investments\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\nDesperate to beat deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has quietly submitted his forms, with the inclusion of a \u2018place holder\u2019 as running mate.\n\nAt the same time, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has constituted a 12-man committee-led by Chief Tom Ikimi, to screen the presidential nominees of the party.\n\nAlso, following the meetings of the various elders and consultative committees of the party, on the choice of a vice presidential candidate, the National Working Committee (NWC), of the PDP, met to decide on the recommendations made by the various committees.\n\nThis is as the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said his main objective was to have Nigerians, who would be the beneficiaries of his policy framework to interrogate the policies on how to reduce infrastructure deficit and free up funds for social investments in the country.\n\nAn insider in the ruling APC told THISDAY last night in Abuja that the action by Tinubu and the APC was aimed at meeting the statutory requirement and beat the Friday, June 17, 2022 deadline by INEC for presidential candidates to submit names of their deputies to the commission.\n\nBut the choice of running mate is yet to be resolved hence the decision to include a \u201cplace holder\u201d instead as vice-presidential candidate, while Tinubu and the APC were still making consultations for a suitable deputy that would enhance the party\u2019s victory in 2023.\n\nThe controversy over the suitability of the APC running with a Muslim-Muslim ticket or otherwise, has been very intense in the last few days.\n\n\u201cThe name of the running mate submitted would be changed for another northern politician in the next few weeks. The one submitted is just holding the ticket in trust for another candidate to be picked by Tinubu and the party in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe candidate is still widely consulting, because the issues around the choice of running mate are many and he is yet to address them all. So, he is still asking for more time to look into it all \u2013 whether he is running a Muslim-Muslim or a Muslim-Christian ticket.\n\n\u201cHe personally thinks there\u2019s a need for more consultation and that\u2019s what he is doing. The debate on the choice of deputy has assumed a level that is currently greater than the party and the candidate, hence the need for comprehensive consultation, which is what he is doing,\u201d a reliable party source hinted last night.\n\nThough some names had been mentioned as possible running-mate to the former Lagos state, it was gathered that no compromise have been reached yet.\n\nA source in the Tinubu\u2019s camp told THISDAY that all the northern governors want the position.\n\nThe source added that if Tinubu had his way, he would have loved to pick the former Governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima as his running-mate, but he wanted the president and the governors to pick.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAll northern governors want it. If Tinubu has his way, it will be Senator Kashim. But he wants the president and governors to pick for him.\u201d\n\nAsked why Tinubu does not want to pick his running mate himself, the source stressed he didn\u2019t want to be a winner takes it all.\n\n\u201cHe does not want to be the winner takes it all. You need to respect the president. Buhari did not choose VP for himself in 2015.\u201d\n\nFrom the PDP camp, a credible party source, had disclosed that after an extensive deliberation, where Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and sacked former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha, were considered, the vice-presidential nomination committee, settled for one of the governors.\n\nA statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, however, named Dr. Akilu Indabawa, as the Committee Secretary while Mr. Sunday Omobo, was nominated as Administrative Secretary.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the the Electoral Guidelines of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the National Working Committee (NWC), has approved the nomination of the following party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated Vice Presidential Candidate of our Party for the 2023 general election,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nOther members of the committee, the statement listed, were Chief Osita Chidoka, Member; Rt. Hon. Binta Bello, Member; Chief Mrs. Alh. Mutiat Adedoja, Member; Rt. Hon. Austin Opara, Member; Prof. Aisha Madawaki, Member; Mrs. Ayotunde George-Ologun, Member; Chief Mrs. Chidiebelu Mofus, Member; and H.E. Fidelis Tapgun, Member.\n\nThe party said the screening exercise would hold at the National Working Committee (NWC) Hall, PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, today, June 16, 2022. at 10am.\n\nDeadline for the submission of presidential candidates and the vice-presidential candidates ends tomorrow, June 17, as the INEC website shuts down automatically by 6pm.\n\nAlso, deadline for the submission of governorship and state assembly candidates ended yesterday, Wednesday, June 15, while the submission for National Assembly candidates ends tomorrow, Friday June 17.\n\nSources close to the party informed THISDAY that the NWC will submit the names of three vice presidential nominees to Atiku for his consideration.\n\nThe three nominees were of South South and South East zones.\n\nHowever, based on the timetable by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the PDP is expected to submit the names of its presidential candidate and running mate today or before 6pm tomorrow, Friday, June 17, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku, while reacting to the observations by the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), said it was important to emphasise that actively promoting private sector participation in infrastructure development would be beneficial to the economy.\n\nHe also said it was inevitable that Nigerians incentivise the private sector to take risk and invest in the economy for obvious reasons.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media office, Atiku said, \u201cThere is no telling that Nigeria\u2019s huge infrastructure deficit is making businesses uncompetitive and stunting economic growth. The supply of efficient infrastructure, including roads and rail transportation, communication, adequate power etcetera is extremely important for the economy to grow and create much-needed jobs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to build the economy of our dreams, we must increase the stock and improve the quality of our infrastructure. Inadequate infrastructure has been identified as the most problematic factor for doing business in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate further said, \u201cIn terms of actual spending, Nigeria currently spends less than 1% of its annual GDP on infrastructure as against the required levels of between 3%-5% of annual GDP. This shortfall has created a deficit, estimated at USD 3 Trillion over the next 30 years. Our overwhelmed public sector does not have the resources or expertise to deliver.\n\n\u201cWhile our financing requirement is approximately 100 billion USD per annum, Nigeria\u2019s entire budget is only USD 30 billion. The National Development Plan envisages that 80% of all investments will come from the private sector.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, Nigeria\u2019s core infrastructure sectors are not operating efficiently. Almost all the infrastructure sectors from roads, railways, housing, power, and energy are operating below potential. Over the years, we have observed how these enterprises consume huge public resources, while offering poor quality services.\n\n\u201cMany of these state-owned Enterprises have become a source for political patronage, corruption, and rent-seeking to the detriment of Nigeria\u2019s long-term economic growth\n\n\u201cFor example, Nigeria\u2019s refining infrastructure remains poor despite the perennial injection of unending public resources for turnaround maintenance. The country\u2019s refining capacity per capita is 0.002 bpd/capita compared to Libya\u2019s 0.06 bpd/capita and South Africa\u2019s 0.01 bpd/capita.\n\n\u201cAs of today, Nigeria imports over 80% of its refined products to meet its current needs and is said to be the largest importer of PMS in the world, with significant balance of trade implications,\u201d Atiku explained.\n\nSadly, he contended that, \u201cThe fiscal cost of maintaining these state-owned Enterprises is enormous, and it comes with even greater opportunity costs. By holding unto these underperforming enterprises, Nigeria is sacrificing investments in critical areas, including education, health, water, sanitation, and rural infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFor example, the first phase in the rehabilitation of Nigeria\u2019s refineries is expected to gulp US$1.55 billion! With its current precarious fiscal position and daunting development challenges, Nigeria cannot afford to forego productivity enhancing investments in human capital development and channel scarce resources to moribund enterprises.\u201d\n\nSpecifically on his policy document tagged: \u201cMy Covenant With Nigeria\u201d, Atiku said, his objective was to drive private investment to shift Nigeria from being a \u201cnet importer\u201d to a \u201cnet exporter\u201d of petroleum products and become the refining hub of the entire West Africa region.\u201d\n\nAccording to the former vice president, \u201cWe cannot hope to achieve this without extensive reforms to restore investor confidence, which is currently at its lowest ebb. The active participation of the private sector in the downstream sector will help drive efficiency and healthy competition in the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Public Enterprises, had stated that 67% of the 142 privatised firms were performing, explaining that it must be noted that several firms, not just liberalised enterprises, were facing business environment challenges in Nigeria.\n\nMany have closed and or being forced to relocate to neighbouring countries, because of the poor business environment.\n\nTo this end, Atiku said, \u201cThere is no denying the fact that Nigeria has derived enormous benefits from the creation of a liberal environment to facilitate private sector participation in key sectors of the economy. Today, the IT sector is undeniably the fastest growing services sector in the Nigerian economy. We need to replicate these efforts by extending the reform initiatives to other sectors.\n\n\u201cOf course, different countries have implemented liberalisation programmes with varied outcomes and over time and space just as other policies. But it is easier to point to success stories around the world: from Vietnam to Mexico; from Indonesia to South Africa and Egypt etcetera than outright failures.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, liberalisation and deregulation programmes, have supported the private sector to unleash its growth potentials and enabled these governments focus on investing in education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, water and sanitation with such proceeds.\n\n\u201cEvery reform measure has the potential to create difficulties especially, in the short-term, but with a positive impact on incomes, employment, and poverty, over the medium and long-term. Liberalised firms may face difficulties as they transit from the old culture of rent-seeking and dependence on government for survival, to a new business culture that is driven by efficiency and competition.\n\n\u201cBut Atiku Abubakar will ensure that his economic reform measures are accompanied by a series of mutually supportive activities aimed at easing these difficulties and making the reform measures impactful.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NERC, Discos, Gencos, TCN seal deal on compulsory supply of 5000mw of power from July 1\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\n\n\nAs Nigerians continue to contend with erratic power supply, the World Bank has said the country would need about $100 billion in the next 10 years to tackle the challenge which has defied all efforts by administrations since 1999.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to address the challenge in the power sector, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) yesterday said effective from July 1, 2022, there would be remarkable improvement in the nation\u2019s power sector as market participants have committed in contracts to ensure the generation, transmission and distribution of 5000 megawatts (mw) of electricity in the country.\n\nCommenting on the $100 billion needed by the country over the next 10 years, World Bank\u2019s Regional Director for Infrastructure, Africa West and East of the global bank, Ashish Khanna, who spoke at a programme organised by The Electricity Hub, an organisation which provides insights on the sector, stated that a large chunk of the investment was expected to come from the private sector.\n\nHe added that Nigeria has the highest number of people without electricity worldwide, which has led to about four per cent loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nKhanna said the issues of subsidy, gas-to-power as well as energy access would have to be sorted out before a headway can be achieved in the sector.\n\nOn a comparative basis, he noted that Ghana already has 85 per cent electricity access while Senegal was on its way to achieving 100 per cent access by 2025, stressing that Nigeria has all it takes to move from less than 50 per cent access to universal energy provision.\n\n\u201cOur estimation is that Nigeria will need at least $100 billion in the next 10 years, and it will be very difficult for government or the world Bank to plug that hole.\n\n\u201cAnd the private sector will do a lot of funding and will look out for whether the sector is financially viable. But they will ask \u2018if I set up a plant, will they pay for it\u2019? Is the policy and regulatory environment for the sector certain?\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, if the government gets the distribution side of the industry right, the private sector would be willing to come in. However, he added that Nigerians must begin to see improvement in supply, which is important for their buy-in.\n\nHe further revealed that the World Bank\u2019s engagement in Nigeria is still largest by the organisation anywhere in the world, adding that the country remains an important development partner.\n\nIn his comments, the Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, argued that the sector was now receiving more attention especially on infrastructure from generation, to transmission and distribution as well as the interfaces with gas producers.\n\nHe admitted that the sector hadn\u2019t had enough focus in the past leading to decay, but said President Muhammadu Buhari was determined to upgrade the infrastructure because the country cannot move forward without it.\n\nAliyu said the Siemens project was on course, stressing that it is meant to take generation to 25,000 megawatts by 2025. He assured that between September to December, a number of infrastructure will be arriving from abroad.\n\nHe disclosed that the national grid remains unstable and wouldn\u2019t take the other sources of planned energy, saying that therefore off-grid electricity was being planned in silos.\n\nThe minister further stated that the federal government was planning 14 projects which will give the country 1,000 megawatts with 10 state governors already collaborating for an additional 100 mw each to hit 2,000mw off-grid.\n\nDeclaring that Nigeria was also looking at newer sources of power like hydrogen, Aliyu explained that the current focus on solar is in line with the 30:30:30 vision to ensure that by year 3030, 30 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total power generation will be based on renewable sources.\n\nHe said the industry was undergoing reform, which he said will take time to manifest, insisting that comparing Nigeria with other countries like Senegal was fundamentally flawed because of size and other differences.\n\nAccording to him, the Right of Way (RoW) issue had been a big challenge, taking years to resolve and halting some projects , which eventually will undergo variation because of delays.\n\n\u201cWe want to raise our base-load to a level where we can later integrate these other energy sources,\u201d he said, adding that the federal government was discussing with 14 solar developers to execute projects off-grid.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria\u2019s biggest hydropower plants, Kainji and Jebba, could barely produce 130MW of power, despite having a combined installed capacity of around 1,300MW.\n\nAlso speaking, Country Director, World Bank, Shubham Chauduri, explained that as a development agency, the World Bank was committed to helping the government lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\n\u201cSo in the last two years, between 2020 and 2022, our board has approved $8.5 billion financing for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond financing, he noted that officials of the bank also exchange ideas on how to get these things done, adding that the areas of power, human capital, domestic revenue mobilisation, among others remain very critical.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria needed to bring the missing pieces in the industry together, including the technical side, accountability , financing and regulatory clarity.\n\nOn top of the existing support , he stated that there\u2019s another $1.5 billion for which approval has been given , plus the energy transition plan which could take another $2.5 billion,.\n\nNERC, Discos, Gencos, TCN Seal Deal on Compulsory Supply 5000mw of Power from July 1\n\nMeanwhile, NERC has said from July 1, 2022, there would be remarkable improvement in the nation\u2019s power sector as market participants have committed in contracts to ensure the generation, transmission and distribution of 5000 megawatts (mw) of electricity in the country.\n\nThe commission also disclosed that the phase 1 of the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) where four million locally manufactured meters would be rolled out for customers would begin by the end of August this year.\n\nThe Chairman of NERC, Mr. Sanusi Garba, disclosed this yesterday during a media briefing in Lagos, saying the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), generation companies (Gencos) and distribution companies (Discos) have committed to sign contracts which mandates them to ensure that 5000wm generated was bought and paid for, and the gas for generation of that capacity is also paid for as and when due.\n\nHe said the contracts were part of the result of the ongoing reforms in the power sector which are being initiated and supported by the government, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other stakeholders pushing for improvement in the nation\u2019s electricity industry.\n\nGarba said this was the first time market participants were coming together to commit to pay for energy produced by entering a contract to ensure payment or consequences for default.\n\nNigeria\u2019s power sector has been enmeshed in multiplicity of challenges even after the privatisation of the distribution and generation aspcts of the sector in 2013, resulting in poor supply to Nigerians.\n\nGrid collapse has become a regular occurrence in the sector with the power grid recording its latest collapse just a few days ago, throwing Nigerians in darkness, despite trillions of naira pumped into it by the government to improve its performance.\n\nThe country now barely delivers 2000mw power supply to its citizens, with the situation worsening the condition of living of Nigerians and jerking up cost of production.\n\nGarba said this new development would lead to improved service delivery to consumers who require improvement in supply.\n\nHe said any of the parties in the deal that fails to play its part according to the terms of the contracts will receive the consequence, stressing that the targeted 5000mw will only be achieved when all parties comply.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, what we are trying to do is, consumers require the service, the Discos should commit to buying this electricity from those who are generating it. Gencos that are generating the power must commit to buy the fuel to generate that electricity, and the only way it can be done and in a sustainable manner is if it is underpinned by contracts.\n\n\u201cAnd if any of the market participants defaults, then obviously, there will be consequences for not providing what you said you will do.\n\n\u201cThat is the basic explanation of what we are doing which will take effect from first of July. So, we are going to start with 5000mw. Discos will commit to buy and Gencos will commit to generate and ensure that gas is there to provide this power by paying for gas. So, there will be no stories of I don\u2019t have gas to produce.\u201d\n\nGarba also informed that apart from committing to deliver 5000mw on July 1, they would also see an opportunity to increase that contracted volumes from 5000 to 5,500 up to 7000mw.\n\nThis, he said, would make Nigerians to be able to see a trajectory of improvement in not just maintaining the targeted volume of power but to also ensure stability of supply and then assess if there is enough infrastructure to ramp up to 7000mw.\n\nHe assured categorically that power consumers woulf begin to see improvement in supply by \u201cfirst of July\u201d.\n\nHe said TCN has confirmed that it could deliver 5000mw and that even the Discos had successfully distributed 5000mw before but that they couldn\u2019t continue delivering that 5000mw because of commercial reasons.\n\nThe NERC chair added, \u201cSo, the commission decided that this commercial issues militating against low distribution must be sorted out. For Nigerians to have 5000mw, there must be a commitment to buy 5000mw. That hasn\u2019t happened before. This is the first time you have Discos committing to this.\n\n\u201cAnd the TCN will be committed to deliver that 5000mw. And we have identified power plants that will come and contract for the gas to deliver 5000mw. It hasn\u2019t happened before.\n\n\u201cNow, the second leg is, will there be payments because a contract without payment doesn\u2019t work? So, we have sat down working with the Discos, with everybody to ensure that there will be sufficient cash flow to undertake the contracts, because if I sign a contract to deliver gas to you and you default to pay for it, tomorrow, I will shut the power out.\n\n\u201cSo what we are saying is, this is something that has been done to just steer back the market to a way it was designed to work in the first place.\u201d\n\nAlso, the commission disclosed that the phase 1 of the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) where four million locally manufactured meters will be rolled out for customers will begin by the end of August this year.\n\nIt said about 45 local prepaid electricity meter manufacturers have submitted their bids and that the programme was still on the procurement stage.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

However, he has to battle with the splintered power of the party in the state.\n\nCan the sheer popularity of Fayose be enough to get him the Ado-Ekiti seat?\n\nSEGUN ONI\n\nSegun Oni belongs to the short and unfortunate list of Nigerian governors sacked by courts. He was thrown out of office in 2010 after the appeal court ruled that the 2007 election that brought him into power had been rigged.

However, the popularity and acceptability of SDP in the state will make or mar his chances.\n\nCan Oni lead an underdog third force to win the Ekiti governorship election?\n\nWOLE OLUYEDE\n\nWole Oluyede is the African Democratic Congress (ADC) candidate in the June 18 poll.\n\nThe medical practitioner was formerly a member of the APC. He was among the party members suspended indefinitely for instituting court actions against the ruling party.\n\nHe joined ADC and, subsequently, the upcoming governorship race.\n\nAgainst the towering influence and popularity of the PDP and APC, Oluyede and ADC on paper have a slim chance of nicking the required criteria to win the election.\n\nBut with the bigger parties dealing with aggrieved factions, can Oluyede pull the clout that would exploit their division?\n\nOTHER CONTENDERS\n\nThe heavyweights aside, there are twelve other candidates on the ballot for the Ekiti governorship election on Saturday.\n\nReuben Boye Famuyibo \u2014 Accord (A)\n\nAjagunigbala Moses Olajide \u2014 African Action Congress (AAC)\n\nElebute-Halle Josephine Kemi \u2014 Action Democratic Party (ADP)\n\nBenjamin Olufemi Obidoyin \u2014 All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA)\n\nFagbemi Peter Adegbenro \u2014 Allied Peoples Movement (APM)\n\nChristiana Modupe Olatawura \u2014 Action Peoples Party (APP)\n\nDaramola Rowland Olugbenga \u2014 Labour Party\n\nFatomilola Oladosu Abiodun \u2014 New Nigeria People Party (NNPP)\n\nIyaniwura Tope Ifedayo \u2014 National Rescue Movement (NRM)\n\nAgboola Olaniyi Ben \u2014 Peoples Redemption Party (PRP)\n\nAdebowale Oluranti Ajayi \u2014 Youth Progressive Party (YPP)\n\nAdeolu Kolade Akinyemi \u2014 Zenith Labour Party (ZLP)",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: How Funfere Koroye designed his way from China to the UK",
          "text": "Today\u2019s digital nomad is a design engineer who has worked in 4 continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. After designing tech-enabled devices and shoes for Tecno, AFA Sports, and Thando\u2019s, Funfere Koroye now lives in the UK where he is an Ambassador for TechNation and CEO of hardware and innovation startup Nupay Technologies (Nupay Tech)\n\nIn an hour-long conversation on Google Meet, Koroye shares with TechCabal how he\u2019s ended up earning \u00a35,000 per project working as a freelance hardware engineer.\n\nFirst, what exactly does a design engineer do? I\u2019ve heard of graphics designers, UI/UX designers, and even art directors. Design engineering is a first for me.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: we design the hardware of things; how they look, how they feel, and the materials used. We\u2019ll direct the look and feel of the things you use, from laptops and phones to shoes and even toys.\n\nSo you guys are basically architects, but for everyday objects. How does one become a design engineer?\n\nWith a design engineering degree, you\u2019re taught a facet of things. I should say that design engineering, as a degree, is not specific to one industry. You have to specify what industry you prefer while doing the course. Typically, in America where I studied, there are 4 industries for design engineers: furniture, footwear, transportation, and the tech industry. But within the Big 4, there are subsets like jewellery, bags, even boats. Regardless of the industry you specialise in, it all starts on pen and paper, as with any design work, whether UI/UX engineering or hardware engineering. You draw out the idea that you want to create, make a 3D version of that design, and a prototype of the 3D design is created at the factory. Most times, the prototype is a mould that\u2019s used to create the pattern of hardware. Companies everywhere use design engineers. Nike and Adidas both hire design engineers and product designers to help them make their shoes. The funny thing is that the UI/UX folks have stolen product design from us; design engineers are the true owners of the term product design.\n\nIs design engineering what you\u2019ve always wanted to do though? Or is it something you stumbled upon?\n\nYes! I\u2019ve always dreamed of being an inventor. When I decided on becoming an inventor, there weren\u2019t really any options in Nigeria to help me achieve that goal so I had to look elsewhere. I looked at the US, I looked at Europe, the UK, and then finally settled on San Francisco. I was 17, in 2007, when I first made that journey, so that in itself was a bit crazy because I had never travelled out of Nigeria prior to that point. And, you know, that was the beginning for me.\n\nSo what was your first professional experience as a design engineer like?\n\nMy first real professional experience had me move all the way to China to intern for a shoe manufacturing company, and I loved it. In my last year in school in the US, I transferred to my college\u2019s campus in China, and I fell in love with the country. There, I interned as a junior designer for a shoe company. Then after I graduated in 2012, I left the US and moved to Italy for a bit to work as a shoemaking apprentice which is also a part of design engineering. So with my first professional experiences, I dabbled a bit in a few aspects of design engineering.\n\nWow, the US, Italy and China in your early career. How long were you in these countries?\n\nIn the US, I was there for 5 years, but I had to leave once my student visa expired. I lived in Italy for a year, and in China, I\u2019d say a total of 4 years. My first year in China was as a transfer student. Then, after I left Italy, I moved back to China to work for the same shoe company I had interned with. During that period [I was] shuffling between China and Nigeria. I finally had to leave China in 2016.\n\nOh, why did you leave? Sounds like you loved China.\n\nIt was difficult to get residence in China. China\u2019s work and business visas only grant you 30 days\u2019 residence, and after it expires, you have to go back to your country and reapply. You and your employer can apply for a temporary residence permit, but that often takes 6 weeks to process and even then is not a sure thing. Around the time I was there, the Chinese government also had strict rules, something to do with Nigerians flouting the rules, so it was even difficult to get Chinese employers to sponsor you. So after shuffling for a few years, my re-entry request was declined and I found myself back in Nigeria in 2016.\n\nThat must have been hard, moving back to Nigeria full-time right after your career had taken off.\n\nNot really. Like I said, I was already shuffling between Nigeria and China so it wasn\u2019t really hard for me to adapt. When I got back, I was applying for jobs in the most random of places. But I got an email one day from Tecno Mobile and they wanted me to join their design lab as a phone developer and industrial designer. The job gave me enough time to freelance in my role. That\u2019s actually what led me to start specialising in one area of design engineering\u2014tech-enabled handheld devices. So yeah, leaving China was sad but it put me on the path I am now which has seen me even found my own tech startup.\n\nAnd how was the money through all this? How much does a design engineer earn?\n\nIt\u2019s different for everybody, of course. When I was at Tecno, I was earning about \u20a6400,000 (~ $1,500) a month and this was in 2016, I believe, and I was 26 at the time. And it wasn\u2019t exactly ideal because I initially asked for \u20a6800,000 ($3,000) a month, but they wouldn\u2019t agree. After I left Tecno, I worked in other places where I was earning about \u20a6800,000\u2013\u20a61 million ($3,800) a month. This continued right up until the pandemic when I moved to the UK. For freelance projects though, it depends on how much input they need for me, but it\u2019s at least \u00a35,000 per project. I\u2019ve earned as high as \u00a320,000 for a project.\n\nOh, so your taste for Nigeria didn\u2019t last very long then. What changed?\n\nCOVID came, basically. I\u2019d visited the UK before but I never really saw myself living there. But around the time the pandemic was winding down, I decided to build a hardware product for the LPG industry called Nugas (Nupe energy). Sadly, it didn\u2019t take off but we did get some funding and traction. So it just dawned on me that I needed to leave Nigeria and get a different perspective on building products.\n\nHow did that pan out?\n\nShort version, I\u2019m now a Visa Ambassador for TechNation, the company that endorses visas for UK\u2019s Global Talent Visa in the digital technology industry. So I\u2019d say it really worked out well.\n\nAnd the long story?\n\nI had to think about how I could get into the tech space in London. That\u2019s how I came across the Global Talent Visa and TechNation which is open to tech people with no less than 5 years of tech experience who can add to the UK economy. The great thing about this is that there are 2 categories, Exceptional Talent, for recognised leaders, and Exceptional Promise, for emerging leaders. And the requirements were quite minimal: I needed a stellar CV, a reference for good work, and my name in the press. And you know the best part?\n\nAirport food?\n\nErr, no. The best part about the Visa was that I wouldn\u2019t need to stay in the UK for the duration of the Visa. The Global Talent Visa only requires you to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every working year you\u2019ve applied for, and you can apply for up to 5 years. It means that I have 6 months to explore other countries, and do more things.\n\nSo you\u2019re basically the poster boy for digital nomads. What\u2019s been your favourite part of it?\n\nI\u2019ve worked in 5 countries now, but I\u2019ve visited almost 20. To date and project, my favourite has to be my time freelancing for a solar hardware solar company in Tanzania called Jaza Energy. They DMed on LinkedIn and said they were looking to create the Tesla battery pack for Africa. So they flew me out to Zanzibar where I lived for a couple of months, all expenses paid. I think that\u2019s one of the beautiful parts of being a digital nomad; your profile is out there on the internet, you\u2019re not just in Nigeria, or wherever you are; you have access to the whole world. As long as somebody is willing to give you work somewhere. You literally are a citizen of the world, you know? I\u2019ll say Zanzibar is my favourite place I\u2019ve been to. But China is my favourite place I\u2019ve lived in.\n\nAs an ambassador for TechNation, I also get to help other people experience this. It\u2019s a non-monetary role but my job is basically to create awareness about the Visa and help applicants craft their applications.\n\nWhat\u2019s your least favourite part?\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s been settling somewhere legally. As Nigerians, we often use studying to gain entry and residence in different countries. Lately, that has become more difficult. Even today, people have a hard time settling even after doing STEM degrees.\n\nFinding a career path has also been tricky because no matter what you study, you still have to sort of pick where you want to see yourself within that industry, especially in the tech industry.\n\nBut it seems like you\u2019ve found a trajectory that works for you. Are there any fears you have?\n\nLike everyone else, I\u2019m afraid of failure. What if I don\u2019t live up to this, this whole tech bro thing, you know? I\u2019ve got a number of eyes on me, and people who often reach out to say they want to do what I do. But I\u2019m still afraid of failing, which is normal.\n\nEverybody in the tech industry knows that in order to succeed, you have to fail a few times. We don\u2019t discuss it enough but that fear is there in all of us.\n\n* Dollar rate is equivalent to Nigeria\u2019s exchange rate in 2016.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to share your digital nomad story, please reach out to me at timi@bigcabal.com.\n\nEnjoyed this article?

          "text": "12 million.\n\nThat\u2019s the estimated number of motor vehicle drivers that Gozem, a Francophone Africa-focused super app, says operate in informal markets across West and Central Africa. But there\u2019s a problem: these drivers do not have access to traditional banks or micro-finance institutions to finance their vehicles. Instead, they rely on money lenders that charge ridiculous interest rates\u2014some are as high as 70% annually.\n\nGozem, which provides a suite of mobility, e-commerce, and financial services to drivers, retailers, and other consumers, announced on Friday that it has partnered with the International Financial Commission (IFC) to solve these headaches for drivers.\n\nIFC has dedicated a $10 million investment into Gozem\u2019s vehicle financing project. This investment will enable Gozem to provide access to affordable vehicle financing in Togo and Benin, its operating markets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis deal comes about 6 months after Gozem closed a $5 million funding and 14 months after it started its vehicle financing program. The company said it has already helped more than 2,000 drivers acquire vehicles with affordable financing. This new partnership will finance new vehicles for 6,000 more drivers.\n\n\u201cMotor vehincle drivers in West and Central Africa will need access to $3 billion dollars of credit facilities annually to finance their vehicles and we are excited that IFC is placing their trust in Gozem to be at the forefront of providing affordable financing solutions to these underserved communities,\u201d Gregory Costamagna, co-founder and co-CEO of Gozem, said in a statement.\n\nUnlike banks that require credit history, asset collateral, or guarantors before issuing loans, or third-party lenders who charge cut-throat interest rates that are only increasing, Gozem simply uses drivers\u2019 data already available on its platform. The company provides this service by leveraging what Costamagna called its \u201csophisticated\u201d KYC process, financial and behavioural data, like the number of trips completed using its app\u2014which can be accessed in a matter of minutes\u2014to calculate drivers\u2019 credit worthiness. This alleviates drivers from keeping track of their bank statements and records; simply by using the app to find riders and gigs, Gozem knows how much they earn and how long they are likely to take to make their payments.\n\nGozem said in a statement sent to TechCabal that for the next year, they will also work with the IFC to test electric bikes in motovehicle operating conditions and \u201cbuild a green battery-swapping station network in Togo and Benin to demonstrate electric bikes can save drivers money.\u201d\n\nGozem\u2019s Raphael Dana, Costamagna\u2019s counterpart as co-founder and co-CEO told TechCabal over the phone that IFC is starting a pilot investment to test the impact and scalability of this model and will double down based on the result of the pilot.\n\nHe added that this partnership also factors in electric vehicles (EV). \u201cWe have set aside 10% of the investment for our EV pilot phase. There\u2019s a dedicated team working on our EV ambition and we need to ensure that the bikes, battery swapping, economic units, etc. work at scale,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, the project will \u201cvalidate electric bikes and that their adoption at scale will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but it will also help drivers save money through lower energy and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric vehicles have the power to said Aliou Maiga, IFC\u2019s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, emphasised that EVs have the potential to \u201ctransform the moto-taxi market in West and Central Africa by lowering carbon emissions and lowering operating costs for drivers.\u201d She said that by partnering with Gozem, together they could \u201cincrease affordable and green financing solutions for moto-taxi drivers to shift to electric bikes.\n\n\u201cWe hope IFC\u2019s investment for these underserved communities will encourage other investors and accelerate the reduction of poverty and greenhouse gasses emissions in these markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant uptick in access financing initiatives lately. Last year, Asaak went into a partnership with Untapped Global to finance 2,000 bikes in Uganda\u2014both EV and fossil-fuel vehicles. Untapped Global had also entered a similar partnership with South African Flexclub.\n\nLooks like Gozem is gearing up for some big funding. In March, Dana told Africa Report that the company was seeking an $80m Series B\u2014$50 million in equity, $20m in debt, and a $10 million pre-series B\u2014fundraising as it prepares to expand to new markets like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Senegal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The plan is that, when you have the pre-germinated nuts, we plant it and nurse it for three months. So, when it\u2019s three months, we will now transfer to the nursery in a bigger bag.\n\nTeam Lead of the Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP), Mr. Churchill Oboh, said Saro Oil Palm Limited has recorded impressive progress with the project\u2019s implementation in Evboesi community, calling on other communities to urgently key into the industrialization drive of the state government so as not to be left behind.\n\n\u201cWhen we started our engagements with communities to cooperate with the investors, some community leaders refused to cooperate with the investors. But Evboesi is a success story because the leaders saw well ahead of time that Governor Obaseki means well for Edo people. I urge such leaders to cooperate with the government and investors to transform all the communities in the State,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohenosa of Evboesi, Chief Billy Akongie, said \u201cObaseki is our son, we are pleased with what Saro is doing in Evboesi because we had had situations in the past where previous governments brought investors and the investors did not deliver the projects.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey will go and buy project vehicles and brand them and after a while, the contractors will disappear, and that will be the end of the project. But with Obaseki as governor, the story is different. He promised he would develop Orhionmwon local government area when he was campaigning for re-election and he brought Saro to partner with us on this project.\n\n\u201cWe are pleasantly surprised at what Saro is doing in Evboesi; our youths have been gainfully employed on their farm and we are very happy about the 500 KVA transformer that Saro Oil Palm gave to us. They have delivered all the things we requested from them and Saro and our people are partners on this project that will cater for our children and grandchildren. With this project, Obaseki\u2019s name will never be forgotten by our people.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States.

Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

To the best of my knowledge, I know it is a rumour, I have not confirmed that he is going to pick another Muslim to run with him.\n\n\u201cEven at that, I don\u2019t this is the first time Nigeria is experiencing a Muslim-Muslim ticket.

It was gathered that family members had taken away the remains of some of the victims of the massacre for burial.\n\nAdemola-Olateju had in an earlier post disputed claim that the \u1eccw\u1ecd massacre victims are getting mass burial. She said Governor Akeredolu had agreed with the Catholic Church on how to give the victims of the massacre a befitting burial.\n\n\u201cLast week when Governor Akeredolu received Catholic Bishops at \u1eccw\u1ecd, all EXCO members were on hand. We all know the Catholic Church is one of the most powerful institutions in the world.\n\n\u201cThey have a great history and tradition to draw from. They even have a country, the Vatican. The Catholic Bishop of Ondo, The Most Reverend Jude Arogundade requested for land to bury the victims. He asked that the land be big enough, because they will build a memorial dedicated to the victims with their names.\n\n\u201cEven those who have taken their dead to Kogi and the Southeast will have headstones. They are planning a memorial park, the like we have never seen in this country. The governor approved the request immediately.\n\n\u201cIs a memorial park with individual headstone a mass grave? Is creating a memorial park to make sure we never forget, a mass burial? May God save us from ignorance, the evil of misinformation and the evil of ourselves,\u201d Adamola-Olateju said.\n\nSee the names and pictures of the victims of the Owo terror attack below\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",
          "summary": "By Palma IleyeIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others.\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\nIts potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic.",

A seller of vote will not invite the police or make it known in public that he wants to sell his vote. The buyer will equally not make it known to the police that he wants to buy votes; so, it is always something that is done in total secrecy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Say Something\u2019\n\nIn previous elections, political parties and politicians have been accused of inducing the electorate at polling units, thereby engaging in vote-buying and vote-selling which have been criminalised by the government.\n\nThe disturbing rate of such electoral malpractices has become worrisome for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u2013 the nation\u2019s electoral umpire.\n\nINEC, in collaboration with the security agencies and other stakeholders, has embarked on a series of campaigns to curb the trend.\n\nKokumo, who is leading over 17,000 police personnel and assets deployed for the election in Ekiti, assured residents that the force would do well to address their concerns in that regard.\n\n\u201cI want to assure the good people of Ekiti State that we have our men out there who are on surveillance, gathering information as regards this, and I want to urge members of the public that if you see something, try and say something.\n\n\u201cIf you have information concerning those intending to buy votes and those intending to sell votes, reach out to us. We have emplaced adequate measures to check vote-buying, to check vote-selling, and we have the capacity to locate them wherever they are to effect their arrest, carry out our investigation, and process them through the judiciary; they have both committed an electoral offence for which they will be processed through the court.\u201d\n\nNeutral Police\n\nAway from vote-buying and vote-selling, the DIG said actions have been taken to ensure policemen remain neutral throughout the period of the election.\n\nHe listed such measures to include training of policemen and withdrawal of personnel attached to Very important Persons (VIPs) as security aides.\n\n\u201cBefore now, we have had capacity building for our men, and part of the things we had actually instilled is neutrality in situations like this. So, no officer of the Nigeria Police should be out there for the election assignment and resort to being unnecessarily partial or trying to favour a particular political party against the other,\u201d said Kokumo.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019ll remain apolitical, we\u2019ll remain neutral, and we\u2019ll provide adequate security for men and (electoral) materials. We have withdrawn policemen attached to (politicians) in form of aides; to VIPs in order to have a seamless exercise.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the situation where those attached to the VIPs are used on the field to cause unnecessary mayhems, to wreak havoc; so, we have withdrawn them.

          "text": "The people of Ekiti State will on Saturday go to the polls to elect another governor who will take over the state governance from the outgoing governor, Kayode Fayemi and political parties are already in last minute rush to woo electorate.\n\nIn this interview, Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Funminiyi Afuye, says his party, the All Progressives Congress is fully ready for the Saturday governorship election.\n\nHonourable Afuye said the Kayode Fayemi administration\u2019s sterling performance in the last three and half years is enough reason for Ekiti residents to reelect APC.\n\n\u201cI can say without fear of contradictions that our party is ready both at the retail, the wholesale and indeed the at the mega levels. At the retail, we have been going round networking, talking to people, individually, to groups and associations. In terms of wholesale, we have been going round the villages and communities. And of course, the icing on the cake was the presence of the whole party apparatus in Ekiti on the day before yesterday (Tuesday). They were led by no other person than by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the national chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cThe governor has performed excellently and delivered on all his campaign promises. We are running on the platform of good governance delivered by the Fayemi administration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the peaceful conduct of the poll and refusal of some candidates to sign peace accord, the speaker said: \u201cWell as far we are concerned, we have the tradition of trajectory of peaceful conduct of elections even if we have been victims of intimidation in the past elections, we are peace loving people and we have not departed from that. You are aware that leaders were the people that fought for this democracy, so, whatever will bring peaceful and free and fair election we stand by it, that\u2019s our ethos. We are going to give people of Ekiti an election that is free, fair and peaceful.\n\n\u201cApart from the peace accord at the state level, I also signed a peace accord in my community championed by my traditional ruler. That tells you we are lovers of peaceful conduct.\u201d\n\nDismissing the claims by some political opponents that the Fayemi administration has not run the state in a transparent manner, the speaker said \u201cThe govt of the day is transparent that you haven\u2019t heard of scandal of any sort. Our candidate is running on continuity, the five pillars of governance embarked upon by Fayemi\u2019s administration. Governance should be a continuum but the current administration has addressed the pillars significantly. That\u2019s what BAO too will build on.\u201d\n\nHonourable Afuye also rates Fayemi administration high in the area of security. \u201cSecurity is well managed and checkmated in Ekiti by Fayemi Administration. Of course there are skirmishes, but they are nipped in the bud. Fayemi Administration has done greatly well in the area of security. I always tell my friends that Ekiti is the most secured state in Nigeria, but security is a business of everybody and Ekiti people don\u2019t take laws into their hands. People of Ekiti go about their daily activities without fear. Ekiti is not a banana republic that is not safe to live but I know we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d",

As a governor, Okowa had a clear vision which he pursued with incandescent passion, valour, candour, honour and unassailable accomplishments.\n\n\u201cAbove all other enviable attributes, Okowa resonates as a team player, diverse ethnic manager with a friendly finesse and character comeliness. He is one of the few who has sustained in government without the elixir and grandeur delusion that has become the characteristics of many in positions of authority.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Okowa has served both as sub-ordinate, co-ordinate and super-ordinate to several persons without skirmishes. Dr Ifeanyi Okowa is a quintessential gentleman.\n\n\u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worlwide led by Ambassador Professor George Obiozor is very proud of you.

In a sit-down interview with BBC, Lavrov categorically denied Russia \u2018invading\u2019 Ukraine and instead, he stressed that Moscow \u2018declared a special military because we had absolutely no other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into NATO was a criminal act.\u201d\n\nLavrov also reiterated Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s remarks when he said that his forces would carry out the operation in Ukraine to \u2018denazify\u2019 the neighbouring nation. The Russian Foreign Minister said that there were Nazis in Ukraine. The BBC journalist quoted to Lavrov an official United Nations (UN) report about the Ukrainian village of Yahidne, in the Chernihiv region, which states that \u201c360 residents, including 74 children and five persons with disabilities, were forced by Russian armed forces to stay for 28 days in the basement of a school\u2019 There were no toilet facilities, water\u201910 older people died\u201d. On being asked if the UN report is what Russia is doing to \u2018fight Nazis\u2019, Lavrov said, \u2018It\u2019s a great pity\u2019but international diplomats, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Secretary-General and other UN representatives, are being put under pressure by the West. And very often they\u2019re being used to amplify fake news spread by the West\u2019.\n\nChallenges UK PM to defeat Russia\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began, the UK has publicly stood in support of Kyiv and has pledged to see Moscow\u2019s forces being defeated. From sanctioning Russian officials to publicly touting Ukraine\u2019s win and sovereignty, the UK is also among the list of Russia\u2019s unfriendly countries alongside several other nations in the West.\n\nWeighing in on Russia-UK ties, Lavrov said, \u2018I don\u2019t think there\u2019s even room for manoeuvre any more\u2019because both [Prime Minister Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees.

          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele has called on the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and shipping companies to support the drive by the bankers\u2019 committee to improve foreign exchange (FX) earnings through non-oil exports.\n\nSpeaking at the CBN\u2019s Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit in Lagos on Thursday, with the theme: \u201cSetting the Roadmap toward achieving RT200 and non-oil export for development,\u201d Emefiele stressed that it had become more urgent for Nigeria to increase its forex and has called for coordinated efforts by players in the export ecosystem to aid seamless export.\n\nAlso, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who also spoke at the summit, reiterated the call for economic diversification in Nigeria, saying the country should shift from overdependence on oil and gas, to agricultural produce, solid minerals, chemical products, furniture and clothing as well as tourism among others.\n\nThe Bankers\u2019 Committee had at its meeting in February 2022, unveiled the RT200 FX Program, which is an initiative aimed at raising $200 billion in non-oil export earnings over the next three to five years. This initiative was anchored on five pillars, namely: Value-adding Exports Facility, Non-oil Commodities Expansion Facility, Non-oil FX Rebate Scheme, Dedicated Non-oil Export Terminal and Biannual Non-oil Export Summit.\n\nEmefiele restated that over N3.5 billion had been paid to exporters who brought in their export proceeds. He said in April 2022, the CBN released a total of N3.5 billion non-oil export rebate to exporters through the banks in support of the RT200 initiative.\n\nHe appealed passionately to the NPA, the Customs and shipping companies in a working group to work with the bankers\u2019 committee to resolve challenges associated with international trade.\n\n\u201cWe have heard of people who want to export their goods queuing for weeks or months before their goods can go out. Because time is against us, in the short run, what can the NPA and customs do for the exporters, whether they want to create a set of dedicated routes from which they can easily export their goods?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need those export proceeds badly. It is sad that because of the problem of finding an easier route for goods to be exported out of the country, Nigerian exporters prefer to transport by road or sometimes barges from Lagos to Accra or the Republic of Benin to export from there. Doing these we lose the opportunity to earn export proceeds.\n\n\u201cCustoms and NPA in the working group, we want you to look at the long run and the short run. In the short run look at how we immediately create a dedicated export route for exporters, so that their goods can leave. Many of those containers that bring goods into the country go out empty because of these problems,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, Emefiele said: \u201cLet us work on finding a dedicated route where exports can go out easily. In the long run, how do we work on the Lagos Free Trade Zone and create a road that will take the goods through an express road. The Lekki port has a blueprint of a road that goes to Ondo which is about 50km.\n\n\u201cThe Infracorp is ready to fund that if we can yield to that because what I find is that instead of yielding to doing what is good of our country, people want to own colonies because they believe it is their exclusive responsibility. We\u2019re talking about how we can work together now.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the programme was borne out of the realisation that most of the country\u2019s current sources of forex inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\n\u201cAnd with the grossly untapped potential of Nigeria, there is a strong need for us to work together to diversify our forex revenue earnings to the non-oil sector.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, it is the view of the banker\u2019s committee to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control,\u201d he noted.\n\nFurthermore, he said as things presently stand, the country has very little choice left but to look inwards and find innovative solutions to our problems.\n\n\u201cMonetary Policy alone cannot bear all the burden of the expected adjustments needed to manage these difficulties. These problems call for urgent design and steadfast implementation of other supportive, structural, and complementary policies that are broad-based, coordinated, and focused on complementing the work of the monetary authority.\n\n\u201cWe would try as much as possible to provide cheap affordable long-term financing for companies that really truly deserve and would conduct export activities of goods and services.\n\n\u201cBut we feel we cannot do this alone. We need a handshake between the bankers, central bank, exporters, and those in the value-chain and more importantly with our brothers and sisters in the government agencies that are involved in the process of export in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere has been indeed unbearable difficulty and challenges faced by exporters in exporting goods out of Nigeria. We need the support of NPA, please work with us, the bankers\u2019 committee is ready in any way to provide the needed support that can smooth the challenges involved in our port operations in Nigeria. We truly and badly need foreign exchange to fund the import needs of our country. We can no longer continue as a country to depend on revenue from crude oil where we have no control over price and quantity.\n\n\u201cWe all need to work together because it is a pledge and responsibility that we can and will something as Nigerians to help our country. Nigerian ports authority, the customs, the shipping lines, please lets do this together. Nigeria can be great in export,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Sanwo-Olu stressed the need for Nigeria to discourage over-reliance on mono-economic revenue, which is the oil sector, and scale up its non-oil exports. He noted that a situation in which oil and gas consistently account for the bulk of government revenues and foreign exchange earnings, was not ideal.\n\nSanwo-Olu who commended the central bank of Nigeria for organising a summit to promote non-oil exports in Nigeria said Lagos State was delighted to host the maiden edition of the strategic meeting.\n\nHe added: \u201cLagos State is home to the biggest and most important sea ports in the country. There cannot, therefore, be any conversations about growing non-oil exports in Nigeria, without bringing Lagos State and our transport and logistics infrastructure into the picture. This is why I am pleased that Lagos State is hosting the maiden summit.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, a lot of the work we have been doing and still doing is aimed at improving the state of transportation infrastructure, to enable imports and exports, and generally bring down the cost of doing business.\n\n\u201cWhen goods for export get stuck on the roads and can\u2019t make it to the ports, we have a big problem on our hands. There is a big price that the economy pays for these dysfunctions, at all levels \u2013 from the small and large businesses whose goods are being exported to the people in the business of exports, to the users of our roads who have to waste valuable time in traffic because of worsening gridlock.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, our responsibility, as governments, to ensure that we make the business of exporting (and also importing) as seamless as possible. Nigeria has so much potential to scale up its exports, shifting from over-dependence on oil and gas to agricultural produce, solid minerals, chemical products, furniture, clothing, and so on.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, while stressing the need for Nigeria to scale up its exports said, \u201ca country in need of foreign exchange has no business downplaying the importance of exports.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe can do a lot to strengthen the naira and our external reserves by focusing on our non-oil exports. This diversification also gives us immunity from the severe shock of depending on a limited pool of exports.\n\n\u201cI commend the central bank for making this a priority, through the launch of the Race To $200 Billion FX Scheme (RT200), among other laudable initiatives. The RT200 FX Scheme seeks to generate as much as $200 billion in FX earnings, specifically from non-oil sources, over the next few years.\n\n\u201cI am aware that, so far, the central bank has approved the payment of billions of naira to more than 100 exporters who have taken advantage of the scheme and have scaled up their non-oil exports of finished and semi-finished goods in line with it.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that this scheme will go from strength to strength, and deliver to an extent beyond the expectations of the central bank and the Nigerian economy. I urge exporters to readily take advantage of it. I also urge the central bank to continue to fine-tune and strengthen this process, while also thinking of new and innovative initiatives that will achieve similar outcomes.\n\n\u201cLet me also commend the efforts of all the businesses that are investing heavily in the production of products that qualify for the RT200. One example that comes to mind readily is the Dangote Group, which recently commissioned the largest granular urea plant in Africa, right here in Lagos.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to note that the factory\u2019s main product, urea, displaced Sesame seeds as Nigeria\u2019s biggest non-oil export in the first quarter of 2022. I look forward to similar impactful investments of this nature, in Lagos and across the country.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the Managing Director, NPA, Muhammed Bello-Koko, said to create a seamless ecosystem for export, there was need for coordination amongst all the agencies.\n\n\u201cThe problem with automation is that each of the stakeholders is working in silos. So, the level of automation of the NPA is not the same as the customs and the shipping line. The second problem is that when we all automate we will be able to integrate the system,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, in Kano State, said his government must develop a policy on cyber warfare that has as its strategic focus on the prevention of cyber-attacks against critical national infrastructure.\n\nBuhari also boasted that his administration had significantly degraded Boko Haram insurgency, the Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), Eastern Security Network, (ESN),banditry and other forms of insecurity in many parts of the country.\n\nHe, therefore, charged the Nigeria Police Force High Command to evolve realistic strategies and operations geared towards tackling cyber crimes in the country.\n\nBuhari, who spoke during the passing out parade of the 4th regular course cadets officers of the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, in Kano State, explained that Nigeria has now slide from fourth to sixth on the international index of nations affected by terrorism.\n\n\u201cMy administration has also focused on security by repositioning our national securities to perform their duties effectively. We have equally embarked on some crucial changes in their funding structure and mode of operation.\n\n\u201cIn a world, where insecurity is constantly evolving, the enforcement responses have to equally evolve, not just to keep up, but to stay ahead. This administration has signed into law the new police act to ensure improvement in the welfare and service delivery to reach the best international practices.\n\n\u201cI commend the effort and resilience of the Nigeria Police Force and sister agencies for the giant strides recorded so far in the fight against the prevailing security challenge. As you are all aware, this administration came into office with determination to tackle three areas: the security, building and sustainable economy and fighting corruption. We can say that recent positive development has shown that there is general improvement in all these three areas,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that his administration had since inauguration in May, 2015, has impacted positively in Nigeria\u2019s Economy, corruption and security, Buhari told the graduating cadets that modern policing transcended land, sea and air, and that the internet and new digital technologies had provided a platform for the emerging offences to reach unprecedented levels.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMany of the enemies you will confront will be permanently faceless or concealed, leveraging technology to wage warfare that has the potential to be even more destructive than anything the world has ever known.\n\n\u201cWe must develop a policy on cyber warfare that has as its strategic focus on the prevention of cyber-attacks against critical national infrastructure, minimizing national vulnerability to cyber-attacks and minimising damage and recovery time from cyber-attacks.\u201d\n\nThe president emphasised that his government would continue to demonstrate zero tolerance for crime and criminality, stressing that, \u201cThose who take laws into their hands, who bear arms illegally and who seek to profit from a climate of fear and insecurity will be decisively dealt with.\n\n\u201cThat remains our promise to the people of Nigeria, who elected us to keep them safe and secured. The peace and stability of our dear country will continue to be of utmost importance. You, the Police are our points men and you must rise to the occasion.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the nation\u2019s security transcended law enforcement to include building the right relationships that underpinned the development of secured societies, he said, \u201cThis is why the present administration has been fully committed from the start to strengthening existing relations between Nigeria and her neighbouring countries. It has always been clear to us that there is no way we can achieve the security we seek without the cooperation and support of our neighbours.\u201d\n\nThe President added that his government had implemented far-reaching social support programme ever in the country to tackle poverty, one of the drivers of insecurity, at the roots.\n\nThe President, who presented awards to two graduating cadets, Rachel Oluwatosin Babarinde and Isa Abdulateef, added that his government had been able to degrade the terrorists in the Northeast, and as well checkmated the activities of bandits and kidnappers in the other parts of the country.\n\nHe added that, his government took a resolute stand against pervasive corruption and focused on repositioning the national security for them to perform their duties.\n\nWhile congratulating the cadets for successful completion of their training, the president directed them to maintain the spirit of accomplishment as they prepare to face the tasks ahead.\n\nEarlier, in his remarks, the Commandant of Nigeria Police Academy, Assistant Inspector General (AIG), Ahmad AbdulRahama, thanked the President for honouring the invitation, explaining that the institution was upgraded from professional training to degree awarding in 2012, noting that, it had graduated 1,748 cadets, Assistant Superintendent of Police, over the years, including the 205, who just graduated.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano",

          "title": "Nigeria: Ondo Governor Akeredolu, AGF Malami Disagree Over State of Security",
          "text": "The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Thursday, disagreed over the issues of insecurity and restructuring in the country.\n\nThe two Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) spoke at the ongoing meeting of the 36 Attorney-General of the Federation held in Lagos.\n\nAkeredolu, had in his Keynote address warned that the inability of the federal government to secure life and property would soon leave citizens with no choice but to arm themselves in self-defence stressing that the Nigeria Police had been overwhelmed.\n\nThe governor, who asked the Police to \u201cclose shop\u201d if the federal government could not meet its equipment needs, insisted that the police had failed in their constitutional role of protecting Nigerians and that if the situation did not improve, citizens would be left with no other option but to arm themselves in self-defence.\n\n\u201cThe current spate of insecurity in the country leaves us with no room for equivocation on the right of the states to maintain law and order through the establishment of state police.\n\n\u201cThe growing distrust in the polity is a direct result of the disconnect between the federal government and the constituent units of the country. The economic adversity currently experienced in the country, points directly, at the defective political structure,\u201d Akeredolu said.\n\nThe governor, who maintained that a unitary system could not work, successfully, in a country like Nigeria, further said, \u201cThe 1999 Constitution has been amended twice. There is another promise of further amendments arising from the manifest irregularity in many provisions.\n\n\u201cThis has compelled many lawyers and educated citizens to insist on having a new Constitution, which will reflect the agitations of the various groups, which make up the country. The law is becoming increasingly less certain under these circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe crises created by the 1999 Constitution, as amended, have been unending. There have been agitations that the Exclusive Legislative List in this Constitution is limited to Nigeria\u2019s external trade, customs duties, export duties, tax on incomes, profits and capital gains, interstate commerce, external borrowing, mining rents, and royalties from mineral resources, among others.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, has consistently rejected this suggestion, presumably, because of the humongous 52% revenue allocation to it while the 36 States and the 774 Local Governments share the remaining 48%,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAkeredolu, therefore, challenged states to restructure the country by, among others, setting up their anti-graft agencies.\n\nHowever, in his address at the event, Malami said governors could not continue to agitate for restructuring and state police, when they were responsible for the compromise and mismanagement of the current system.\n\nHe said governors, who have taken over the allocations of local government in their states have no moral right to ask for restructuring.\n\nMalami also stated that, \u201cstate police will not work, because state governors would abuse it, adding: \u201clook at the way they treat local government, imagine what will happen if they control the police?\u201d\n\nMalami advised the governors to utilise the existing structures through the National Assembly to press on with their demands for restructuring and other constitutional amendments.\n\nHe said the present controversies surrounding the Paris/London Club loan refunds, could have been avoided if NGF/state governments and ALGON, who engaged the services of consultants and contractors, honoured their agreements.\n\n\u201cNGF and ALGON have not denied engaging the consultants and contractors on behalf of their respective States and Local Governments,\u201d he maintained.\n\nOther speakers at the event were Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Kazeem Alogba, the state\u2019s Attorney-General, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), the President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olumide Akpata and Director-General of the Nigerian Governor\u2019s Forum, Asishana Okauru.\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja and Wale Igbintade in Lagos",
