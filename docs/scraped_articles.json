While the three representatives from the university should be reduced to one.\u201d\n\n\u201cChairman Medical Advisory Committee should no longer be appointed from the university but among substantive Directors/ Deputy Directors in the teaching hospital and should be in accordance with Public Service Rules of Seniority,\u201dhe added.\n\nThe union,he said, also demanded that:\u201dOther health care professionals should have at least four directors out of eight in the Federal Ministry of Health same applicable to State Ministry of Health.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment should establish schools or colleges of postgraduate studies for Clinical Residency training for other health care professionals as it exists for medical and dental practitioners,\u201dhe added.\n\nThe union equally demanded \u201cReconstitution of Presidential Committee on Health Sector Reform to include representatives of other healthcare professionals and health sector unions.\u201d\n\nOther demands, a\u00e7cording to Dr Ogbonna,are:\u201dCommencement of the payment of new hazard allowance for healthcare workers;Implementation of sections of past presidential committee reports on health sector considered to be fair to all stakeholders;Immediate implementation of circular on Pharmacist Consultant Cadre and \u201cApproval and implementation of adjusted Consolidate Health Salary Structure,CONHESS.\u201d\n\nNUAHP,he said,also demanded \u201cPayment of outstanding arrears of promotion, withheld salaries and other allowances in all federal health institutions;Payment of salary arrears and other emoluments by some state governments owing such;Payment of shortfall in the April and May 2018 withheld salaries of health workers in the federal health institutions and \u201cFull implementation of Consolidate Health Salary Structure,CONHESS,for state health workers in states yet to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernments at all levels should provide adequate security for health workers against incessant kidnapping, killings and other forms of criminality health workers daily experience in the course of carrying out their essential duties,\u201dhe added.\n\nHe said his union also demanded:\u201dComplete overhauling of public health infrastructures nationwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Union of Allied Health Professionals expressly commends the National Assembly, most especially the House of Representatives, for taking a bold step towards amending the University Teaching Hospitals (Reconstitution of Boards etc) Act Cap U15 LFN, 2004 formerly known as Decree 10 of 1985.\n\n\u201d It was the promulgation of this Decree in 1985 that introduced dichotomy and discrimination into the health sector.\n\n\u201cThese unfair practices have continued to make the public health sector in Nigeria incapable of providing effective, accessible, and affordable healthcare services. It is also evidently clear that the decree was responsible for the crashing of the Nigeria\u0092s health sector from its enviable 55th position now 187th out of 191 countries of the world by the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) ranking.\n\n\u201cIf passed into law, the new Act will ensure that health workers/professionals with competency in hospital administration and management are appointed to manage the hospitals nationwide.\n\n\u201d This will ultimately guarantee effective, efficient and professional management of the hospitals in line with global best practices.

          "title": "Russian War: Blockade of Ukrainian seaports worsening food crisis in Africa \u2014 Enifome",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe blockade of Ukrainian seaports as a result of the Russian war against Ukraine has worsened the food crisis in Nigeria, and other nations in Africa, a public affairs analyst, Emesakoru Enifome, has said.\n\nThe Abuja-based researcher disclosed this in a report titled, \u2018Unblockade of Ukrainian seaports prevention of famine in African countries\u2019 which was made available to journalists in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the continuing rise in world prices for energy and basic foods, caused by Russia\u2019s full-scale armed aggression against Ukraine, has exacerbated the global food crisis, particularly in African countries.\n\nEnifome, therefore, surmised that unblocking of Ukrainian seaports, combined with effective security guarantees for the resumption of shipping and exports of Ukrainian agricultural products, will help resolve the global food crisis and prevent famine on the African continent.\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cGiven that Ukraine is a leading exporter of agricultural products to many African countries, Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukrainian seaports is already negatively affecting world food prices and may increase hunger in some African countries.\n\n\u201cMost leading international organizations are concerned about rising poverty and possible social protests in African countries due to rising food prices.\n\n\u201cThus, according to the report \u2018A new shock and little room to maneuver\u2019 which published on April 28, 2022 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was presented on April 29, 2022 in the conference \u2018Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019, it is noted that the Russian war against Ukraine destroyed world commodity markets, which in turn led to a significant downturn in the world economy, an increase in the cost of basic goods and services, suspended the positive dynamics of economic recovery in Africa after the COVID-19 pandemic, which together may reduce the annual economic growth rate in 2022 to 3.8% of the projected 4,5%.\n\n\u201cThe author of the document, Abebe Aemro Selassie, Director of the IMF\u2019s African Department, argues that food security is a critical issue for all countries in the Sahel, which, together with other problems in the region, threatens to complicate the political, economic and security situation in the region.\n\n\u201cIn this context, Africa expects high inflation (the worst since 2008), rising debt, rising food prices, food insecurity, and social protests caused by famine. According to him, this crisis will have serious consequences for the most vulnerable sections of sub-Saharan Africa, which are directly dependent on wheat imports from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIn addition, high prices for fertilizers and oil will also negatively affect the cost of production of goods and services in the vast majority of countries in the region.\u201d\n\nEnifome noted that the number of women and children suffering from hunger is expected to increase in Nigeria by August 2022, of which 1.74 million children aged 6-59 months will need treatment for acute malnutrition by 2022, which will be the highest rate of 2016.\n\nHe added, \u201cAccording to the UN\u2019s report \u201cHumanitarian Needs and Requirements Overview 2022 released on June 27, 2022 over 30 million Sahelians, most of whom are women and children, will require lifesaving assistance and protection in 2022.\n\n\u201cIf the war Russia against Ukraine becomes protracted, the regions problems will be exacerbated with dire economic and political consequences.\n\n\u201cWith one-third of the worlds wheat supply coming from Ukraine and Russia, hunger in the region will worsen because of the ongoing war between these two countries. Countries in the Sahel region, which are already food insecure, rely on wheat supplies from Ukraine, and the current conflict has already affected food prices, exacerbating the hunger crisis in countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.\n\nThe public affairs analyst also noted that the updated report \u2018Nigeria Development Update, June 2022\u2019, which was published on June 14, 2022, by the World Bank, revealed that the number of Nigerians living below the poverty line is projected to increase by 1 million by the end of 2022, to a total of 7 million.\n\nEnifome continued, \u201cAccording to the African Development Bank, the full-scale war launched by Russia against Ukraine has led to a sharp rise in prices in Africa. Thus, the cost of wheat increased by more than 45%, fertilizers \u2013 by 300%, with a shortage of fertilizers is 2 million tons. In the absence of compensatory measures, food production in Africa could fall by 20% and the continent could lose more than $ 11 billion in food production.\n\n\u201cUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, during a visit to West Africa (Senegal \u2013 01.05.2022, Niger \u2013 02.05.2022, Nigeria \u2013 03-04.05.2022), said the war in Ukraine is aggravating a triple food, energy, and financial crisis across Africa that is destroying the global food, energy and financial systems of developing countries. It was noted that there is no real solution to the problem of global food security without returning to the world markets of agricultural products of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, some international experts emphasize the need for the African leadership to find optimal ways to overcome the food crisis, promoting Russian narratives about the importance of lifting economic sanctions on Moscow. But the main cause of this crisis and growing famine on the African continent is Russia, which continues to destroy food storage facilities, including wheat, throughout Ukraine, steal existing grain stocks in the temporarily occupied territories and block Ukrainian seaports in the Black Sea.\n\n\u201cRussia does not allow to deliver of agricultural products by sea from Ukraine to countries in Africa and other regions of the world, where it is extremely necessary.\n\n\u201cAs the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said during his address at the session of the Bureau of the Assembly of the African Union on June 20, 2022 \u2013 \u2018\u2026if it was not for the Russian war against Ukraine, there simply would be no shortage in the food market. If it was not for the Russian war, our farmers and agricultural companies could have ensured record harvests this year. If it was not for the Russian war, people in Africa, people in Asia, and anywhere else in the world would not suffer from the catastrophic rise in food prices. There simply would not be such a catastrophic rise in prices\u2019\n\n\u201cTherefore, the unblocking of Ukrainian seaports, combined with effective security guarantees for the resumption of shipping and exports of Ukrainian agricultural products, will help resolve the global food crisis and prevent famine on the African continent.\u201d",

          "text": "By Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nThe National Population Commission, NPC, has commenced State Level Training for 109 field personnel in Benue state to be engaged in the coming Trial Census scheduled for Monday June 27 to Friday July 8, 2022.\n\nThe 12 day training, which is taking place at the Benue State University Auditorium in Makurdi is to equip field functionaries with the required skills to effectively and efficiently deliver on the exercise.\n\nDeclaring the training open, the Federal Commissioner, NPC Benue State, Mrs. Patricia Kupchi explained that the trainees consisting of facilitators, supervisors and enumerators were carefully selected for the Trial Census through an online recruitment process.\n\nThe Federal Commissioner stated that the exercise would be conducted from July 11 to 24, 2022 pointing out that the house numbering would take place from July 11 to 16, to be followed by validation of Enumeration Area, EA, from July 17 to 19 and the enumeration of persons from July 20 to 24, 2022.\n\nShe said the exercise would be a dress rehearsal to the actual census scheduled for next year with the aim of evaluating all aspects of the census operations before the main census on a limited scale.\n\nAccording to her \u201cthe Trial Census, also known as the \u2018census dress rehearsal\u2019, is one of the pre-census activities. It is a process in which all census operations are tested in a detailed and comprehensive manner.\n\n\u201cThis takes place, ideally and as a matter of best practice, one year ahead of the actual census date, when major external circumstances, such as season (weather), holiday periods, school year schedule, etc. can be expected to be similar to the situation, when the census proper will be conducted.\n\n\u201cThe Trial census tests all phases of the main census, from pianning to the execution of the plans, logistics arrangement and management, questionnaire design and format, training procedures, fieldwork operations, publicity, payment system, data processing, data tabulations and analysis.\n\n\u201cAnd the objectives are to assess the quality of the EA maps, determine requisite educational qualification for enumerators, estimated workload of the enumerators, logistics support for the main Census among others.\u201d\n\nMrs. Kupchi said \u201cIn Benue State, the Trial Census will take place in nine Local Government Areas, LGAs including Katsina-Ala, Kwande and Ushongo in Zone A. Guma, Gwer East and Gwer West in Zone B as well as Ado, Oju and Obi in zone C.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner noted that \u201cthe quality of the personnel for the Trial Census has a great impact on its outcomes. The need to properly train the enumerators and supervisors at the state level cannot be over-emphasized.\n\n\u201cFor the next few days, participants will be taught the rudiments, alongside the necessary skills with practical demonstrations of operations in the field, with the overall effort to deliver a truly scientific Trial Census that can prepare the ground for a credible and acceptable census next year.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the conduct of this state training workshop for field personnel is our strategy of making sure that we have a fully equipped and solid based manpower for the trial census.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is determined to successfully conduct the Trial Census in our quest to deliver a credible, reliable, acceptable and verifiable census to the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the Commission will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the Trial Census is carried out meticulously, professionally and scientifically to provide a good foundation for the smooth conduct of the 2023 Population and Housing Census.\u201d\n\nMrs. Kupchi stated that \u201cthe Commission has introduced new technologies such as CensusPAD and CSPro to ensure that the exercise serves as a good rehearsal that will make the 2023 Population and Housing Census credible, reliable and acceptable.\n\n\u201cThe geospatial and infrastructure data as well as the enumeration form shall be uploaded on the tablets, also called Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which are ultra-portable computers that can run a variety of software programs. Based on the above, the data collection in the\n\nTrial census will be Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAP).\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the Trial Census does not lose focus in view of predetermined objectives and processes, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) instruments have been developed to assess the extent to which objectives are being met or not and whether the processes are being adhered to or not.\n\n\u201cl am therefore, confident that the knowledge and skills to be acquired at this workshop will no doubt equip functionaries to efficiently and effectively carry out their task. It is my hope that the objectives of this workshop will also impact positively on all aspects of the preparations and execution of the 2023 Population and Housing Census.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner assured of the preparedness of the NPC to conduct a credible, reliable, and acceptable 2023 Population and Housing Census in the state.\n\nHighpoint of the event was the administration of the oath of secrecy on the trainees by the acting Assistant Chief Registrar of the Benue State High Court of Justice, Mr. Vincent Kor.",

          "text": "Loss of the 2015 presidential poll and hostile parliament stalled the implementation of the 2014 National Conference Report, former President Goodluck Jonathan has explained.\n\nThe former president gave reasons his administration jettisoned the implementation of the report at the public presentation of a book in Abuja yesterday.\n\nTitled: \u201cThe National Conversation\u201d, a chronicle of the activities of the 2014 National Conference, the book was written by Akpandem James and Sam Akpe.\n\nDr. Jonathan defended his administration through former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF)/ one-time Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, who stood in for him at the book launch.\n\nHe said those blaming him were either playing politics or ignorant of the political environment at the time as well as the length of time it would take to implement the report of a conference of that magnitude.\n\nThe former President said: \u201cWhenever people say that I should have implemented the recommendations, my feeling is either those people did not understand the political environment at that time, the length of time it would take to implement the report of a conference like that or probably was just playing politics with such an important matter.\n\n\u201cThose knowledgeable about the processes of constitutional reforms will know that to implement the Confab report, several alterations will be made in the constitution which would require the involvement of the National Assembly and state assemblies.\n\n\u201cSuch elaborate review couldn\u2018t have been possible at that time because by the time the report was submitted in August 2014, we were already on the verge of a general election.\n\nRead Also: Controversy over 2014 Confab Report\n\n\u201cIt is also important to point out that at that time, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who was a member of my party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had already moved out, with some members, to the opposition party. That meant that a reasonable part of the National Assembly was anti-government.\n\n\u201cWhen you know that your parliament is under that kind of situation, it would have been imprudent on my part to take such a precious document, which I consider as crucial to our development yearnings, to a parliament that would not give it due consideration.\n\n\u201cIf we had a task that would require the alteration of the constitution, enactment of new laws, and amendment of some existing ones, there was no way that could have been done overnight.\n\n\u201cWe were also fully aware that for the segments of our population that were already suspicious of all the actions of government, our intentions could have been misread, especially against the backdrop of the ECOWAS protocol on constitutional reforms which states that no substantial modification shall be made to the electoral laws of member states in the last six months before elections\u201d\n\nHe also attributed his inability to win the 2015 general election to the non-implementation of the report.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen l contested the 2015 election, I expected that l would win a second term within which period I would have worked for the implementation of the Confab report.\n\n\u201cI felt that within the next four-year mandate, the first two years would have been dedicated to implementing a reasonable part of the recommendations.\u201d\n\nJonathan who said the essence of the 2014 Confab was to encourage a healthy conversation among the populace, address the queries agitating the minds of Nigerians and mend fences where possible, lamented that most issues are being politicised at the detriment of national development.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we take politics out of our national calculations, we would all agree that with a fresh government it would have been easier to achieve the implementation of the report.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems of this country is that we like playing politics with things that have very much to do with the national interest. We play politics with our security. We play politics with our economy. We play politics with almost everything. That is not the way to go if we must make progress in realising our national aspirations and goals.\u201d\n\nHe then pleaded with Nigerians not to play politics with the 2014 Conference report, insisting that \u201cat the appropriate time, the country through a dedicated parliament will do the right thing. And the right thing is to duly and dispassionately consider the report of the conference to implement the recommendations for the good of the country.\u201d",

          "text": "Group Managing Director of the Nigeria Nation Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd Mele Kyari said the only way to tackle the rising price of diesel and cooking gas is to increase the production of crude oil in the country.\n\nKyari said this when he appeared before the House of Representative Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), headed by Hon Abdullahi Gaya, over the rising cost of the products.\n\nKyari, who rued acts of vandalism oil facilities, which he said was responsible for the decline in production.\n\nHe said three days ago there was a massive attack on one of their facilities and 27, 000 barrels were lost overnight.\n\nHe also attributed the problem to the non-functioning refineries in the country.\n\nKyari said besides the fact the Russia-Ukraine war was affecting the supply of products across the world, most major oil companies were also shutting down due to the energy transmission to eliminate fossil fuels.\n\nHe said the unavailability of Foreign Exchange (FX) as a result of inadequate exports, was another reason for the problem.\n\nHe said interventions were in place to ensure production improves in July to address some of the FX challenges.\n\nKyari also cautioned against suggestions that subsidies should be made available for diesel.\n\n\u201cIn our country, we do not produce AGO (diesel) and we regret that our refineries are not working. Are we doing anything about it? Yes. We are working on getting them back to work. But they will not come back tomorrow.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, we have decided to do a quick fix for the Warri refinery. The reason is simple. We do not want to go the long route of doing comprehensive turnaround maintenance because we are concerned.\n\n\u201cToday when you buy gasoline or AGO you must pay for it. The traders don\u2019t care. The only way you can pay for it today in the market is that you must USD to pay. We do not have another means of getting USD more reliable than the production from the crude oil that we sell.\n\n\u201cToday we are net importers of everything, perhaps with the exception of food. So when you don\u2019t export you cannot have foreign exchange. Therefore there is a limit to the call the CBN governor to provide for FX. There is a limit to what he can do, because for as long as we are not productive.\n\n\u201cThe only solution is to restore crude oil production in this country. Our current crude oil production including condensate is 1.49 million barrels. The budget level as you are all aware is 1.8 million barrels. So we cannot meet it today.\n\n\u201cToday we have over 205 illegal refinery sites. There are over 295 insertions on our crude oil production line. We have over 200 illegal connections on our oil pipelines. Companies shut down because there is no further need to produce and that is what we are containing. There is massive intervention happening and we believe that we would restore the production through the intervention that we are doing.\n\n\u201cIf we cannot take this back, we cannot even have the FX to fund even the AGO importation. So it is not possible. I can assure you that by the end of July, we would restore the product to a level that we can say we are comfortable with and hopefully address some of the FX issues. When you go to the FX window of the CBN if the dollar is not available, if you give it out, it is simply another FX subsidy.\n\n\u201cTherefore there is a supply gap and one of the reason and we are proud to say that it is good reason, is that we took down many of these illegal refineries and I can tell you potentially the AGO you use may be coming from illegal refineries and we took a significant number of them down and that is why you are seeing the supply challenge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should regret this. It is better that we should have zero from the illegal refineries than have them at all because it is a national disaster and we are poised to ensure that we take them down.\n\n\u201cBut as you do this, you must bring in supply and that is why NNPC intervening sparingly but sufficient enough to cover the gap the other marketers are doing but not enough to provide 100 percent of supply into the country.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion I am going to make is that the Federal Consumer Protection Council, the regulator and including NNPC, we have some level of control around this, at the fuel depots when we bring our products, we ensure that they sell at a mark off that is not beyond cost of acquisition and reasonable margin. This we are already doing.\n\n\u201cBut you cannot say the same for the man who went to acquire FX at N600 to the dollar and brings in products and say you have to sell at the price NNPC is selling. So what we are doing is a dilution of the market, because we have access to FX at N418 and therefore our prices are lower than what they would bring and ultimately it would dilute the market not necessarily competing with them.\n\n\u201cCan we increase supply from NNPC? Yes, provided we are able to restore crude oil production, otherwise the limit of our intervention cannot be endless. Lastly, we should not consider putting subsidies on AGO. We simply cannot afford it. We should not do it. This is the reality. Can we manage the price within a range that is rational? That is free of excessive arbitrage. I think we can focus on this and work together the price so that exploitation does not come in,\u201d he said.",

I have since the conclusion of the processes been inundated with various reports and complaints,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari assured that the leadership of the APC would sustain the hearing and healing process it started to ensure fairness, justice and oneness before the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with our ethos, therefore, I shall continue to address the ensuing challenges and grievances through the party machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primacy of justice in all our actions. If justice is denied, the outcome is usually unpleasant.\n\n\u201cThis is because you are the members who keep the party running. I should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolution of conflict, the Chairman and some members of the National Working Committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party is currently addressing the outcomes as part of the way forward. I am encouraging all the party functionaries to adhere to the truth and to be fair to all parties in any dispute.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari told the senators that the strength and victory of the party in the election would depend on unity of members and ability to prevent injustices or heal them, perceived or real.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary roles is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views and grievances at different levels.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that we have accomplished 23 years of uninterrupted democratic governance, our journey is still in a nascent stage and we continue to learn from our challenges and mistakes. Similarly, our party is still evolving in its culture and practices and it is my expectation and hope that we shall attain a mature level in our internal conduct.\u201d\n\nThe president assured that \u201cjustice shall prevail, aggrieved members shall be assuaged and the interest of the party and the nation shall be protected.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari thanked the senators for suggesting a meeting on the issues, which include the future of the party and pursuing solutions to the challenges thrown up by the recent election related activities, particularly, the primaries.\n\nAfter the meeting, Kalu said the aggrieved Senators would no longer pursue defection from the APC.\n\nHe said on his social media page: \u201cEarlier this afternoon, I led the 22 aggrieved Senators and members of the All Progressive Congress to President Muhammad Buhari, GCFR,\u201d Kalu said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur meeting with Mr President was successful and the issue of decamping from our party has been laid to rest.\u201d",

The idea of what method of primaries should be adopted at the moment is entirely left for the political parties to decide.\n\n\u201cBut as we implement the Electoral Act 2022, we are supposed to be very observant of the strengths and weaknesses of the law. This law is supposed to improve on the electoral processes and procedures in our country.\n\n\u201cSo, it is for us to ensure that where there are weaknesses, we try to come up with measures, amendments to deal with the issues of weaknesses in the law. And, I\u2019m sure it will come full circle when the 2023 elections are held.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt in my mind that all of us in the National Assembly, not only in the Senate, but in the House as well, feel that we must do everything and everything possible to make this Electoral Act serve the purpose for which it was passed and assented to.\n\n2023: Court stops INEC from ending ...

It restored and anchors the power of making laws to the National Assembly; and establishes a principle that once the President accents to a Bill he/she can\u2019t approbate and reprobate, i.e. he/she cannot go to the courts to amend/reject the Bill in part or in whole.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi, however, underscored the need to amend the Electoral Act to revert to the Direct mode of primaries.\n\n\u201cOur recent nasty experience of the misuse of consensus and delegate system has vindicated our earlier position on the merit of direct primaries provided that a verifiable membership register of political parties kept simultaneously at the Ward level and with INEC with all the necessary safeguards against corruption and data manipulation, is put in place.\n\n\u201cAs the political process towards 2023 unfolds, the National Assembly needs to be observant of the loopholes and weaknesses of the 2022 Electoral Act, so that a comprehensive assessment is undertaken to provide adequate grounds for making amendments to the Act before the end of the term of office of the 9th Assembly in May 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nFormer president, Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, opened up on the controversial 2014 report of the National Conference, which he convocated.\n\nJonathan spoke in Abuja at the public presentation of the book titled: \u201c The National Question\u201d, authored by Akpandem James and Sam Akpe said the 1999 Constitution would have been amended by the National Assembly to reflect the recommendations made by the conference and that with elections around the corner in 2015, his intentions would have been misconstrued by a section of Nigerians.\n\nThe ex-president, represented at the event by former Secretary to Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, also explained why he declined to give approval for its implementation, despite mounting pressure.\n\nHe partly blamed Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, who was then Speaker of the House of Representatives, as one of those who was opposed to restructuring and would have frustrated the move. He said with Tambuwal\u2019s defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) it would have been an exercise in futility.\n\nHe said he was optimistic that winning the 2015 election would afford him the opportunity of implementing the report of the confab, which sadly never happened.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the 2014 Confab was to encourage a healthy conversation among the populace, address the queries agitating the mind of Nigerians and mend fences, where possible\u2026My message to the conference was very clear; that they could discuss everything, save for the sovereignty of our great country, Nigeria. I believe, like most Nigerians, that we are better off as one united country\u2026\n\n\u201cWhenever people say that I should have implemented its recommendations, my feeling is either those people did not understand the political environment at that time, the length of time it would take to implement the report of a conference like that or probably were just playing politics with such an important matter.\n\nFulani group picks APC nomination f...

That meant that a reasonable part of the NASS were anti-government.\n\n\u201cWhen you know that your parliament is under that kind of situation, it would have been imprudent on my own part to take such a precious document, which I consider as crucial to our development yearnings, to a parliament that would not give it due consideration.\n\n\u201cIf we had a task that would require the alteration of the constitution, enactment of new laws, and amendment of some existing ones, there was no way that could have been done overnight.\n\n\u201cWe were also fully aware that, for the segments of our population that were already suspicious of all the actions of government, our intentions could have been misread, especially against the backdrop of the ECOWAS protocol on constitutional reforms which states that no substantial modification shall be made to the electoral laws of member states in the last six months before elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I contested the 2015 elections, my expectations was that I would win a second term within which period I would have worked for the implementation of the Confab report. I felt that within the next four year mandate, my first two years would have been dedicated to implementing a reasonable part of the recommendations.\u201d\n\nJonathan commended Akpandem and Akpe, two Nigerian journalists, who participated in the conference, for documenting the experiences, including the intrigues, schemings, interests and the side attractions that formed part of the activities that produced its final document.",

In 1999 he contested elections and became the governor of Lagos, in 2003 he contested election as second term governor of Lagos. He ran and won as a senator in the country. Where record keeping is efficient, and INEC server is functional, he doesn\u2019t need to do fresh submission. However, if whatever he is supposed to submit is not handy, it is not late yet. I\u2019m sure before the time he will submit whatever is required of him.\u201d\n\nThe Imo governor also replied Batos Nwadike, his adviser on Political Matters, who resigned his appointment and accused him of running a non-inclusive government and owing him N27 million.\n\nNwadike also claimed he was repeatedly left in the dark and denied access to the government despite his over 20 years of political association.\n\n2023: Court stops INEC from ending ...

He assured the investors that the industry regulator, NUPRC, will support any aspiration for upstream development with midstream facilities integration towards maximising the value chain.\n\n\u201cIt is envisaged that robust collaboration between the awardees and the Commission will lead to better understanding of the challenges being encountered.

          "title": "As Emefiele Has Been Saying \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "EDIFYING ELUCIDATIONS\n\nOKEY.IKECHUKWU@THISDAYLIVE.COM\n\n0KEY IKECHUKWU\n\nThere are three broad scenarios in the economics of survival and avoidable dependency that the Igbo man understands and lives by. The first is that whoever develops a taste for what grows in another man\u2019s farm should procure same legitimately and nurture it for himself, through diligence and patient effort. The second is that the man with a badly managed taste for what grows in the farm of another, but who does not wish to work for it, is in danger of eventually becoming a thief. The third is that if you insist on eating what is produced by others as often as possible, and you are not producing and exchanging things of commensurate value, you will always be in the debt of those who produce what you are crazy about.\n\nThe above, in a nutshell, even if couched in characteristic traditional Igbo common sense, is what the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has been saying for a long time now about the relationship between our national productivity, consumption profile and the value of the Naira. As we consume more than we produce, import more than we export, buy more than we sell, harvest less than we plant because of security and other challenges, and run a monocultural economy amidst great possibilities of diversification, our economy grows ever weaker.\n\nThus shall it remain, no matter the ingenuity and efforts of its central monetary and fiscal regulatory mechanisms, until the right things are done across several frontiers. Yes, the CBN is doing quite a bit on several fronts but, as Emefiele himself said at the maiden bi-annual non-oil export summit, last week: Monetary policy alone cannot solve our FX challenges or, single-handed, reflate the Nigerian economy. Hear him: \u201cThese problems call for urgent design and steadfast implementation of other supportive, structural, and complementary policies that are broad based, coordinated and focused on complementing the work of the monetary authority.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global logistic value chains and local security challenges are real. So is the urgent need for a more diversified economy; and monetary policy alone simply cannot carry the full weight of what it takes to navigate the current challenges of the Nigerian state, especially against the background of its existing political economy. Only a cocktail of strategies that can help the country earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange can make a difference today.\n\nThe fact that the nation recorded a significant increase in non-oil export repatriation within a short period of implementing the Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme is a pointer to what is possible. This does not remove the fact that Emefiele\u2019s call is not new. What is perhaps of desperate concern today is its urgency. The stridency of his calls is driven by the fact that we now have a larger cocktail of economy-impeding factors than at any other time in our national life. Besides the fact that the person who produces less has less to sell, you have the unique situation where farms are raided by marauders; such that there is actually nothing to harvest and, therefore, nothing whatsoever to sell. Thus inflation, joblessness and crime walk the land.\n\nThe central narrative of Mahatma Gandhi to his people was that they create jobs in order countries when they patronize only foreign-made goods. It took some time for the message to sink in, but it eventually did. That was how India\u2019s cotton farms and textile mills roared back to life. That was how unemployment declined, local earnings grew, family wealth multiplied, overall national income blossomed and India\u2019s reckoning in international trade rose. The story is the same for all nations that have risen out of dreary economic waters in the last fifty years. It can be Nigeria\u2019s story, also. Tata Motors was a laughing stock when it started. Remember what it was like for that company 60 years ago? Look at it today.\n\nWe cannot continue on the path of low productivity, high consumption of what we do not produce and unbelievable internal security problems, retain a monocultural economy and then expect (and even demand) that the national currency should magically gain in value. What did we sell two weeks ago to earn the amount of dollars deployed in the party primaries of our political parties? Has the dollar come down from that new high yet? The national assembly cannot decree that the dollar should drop in value. A presidential fiat will be as useless in that regard as well. Expressions of anger, and even calls for the head of the CBN governor, will not remove or address the structural, institutional and other challenges that are rooted in the political economy of the Nigerian State as it exists today.\n\nPerhaps a new CBN governor will set up his own armed forces to protect farmlands, and farmers from bandits and herders? Oh, no, I get it: he will announce a new value for the Naira and make sure everyone complies with the directive? Let us look at recent measures taken by the bank to: (1) Raise the cost of borrowing so we will borrow a bit less and (2) increase the interest we get from savings. The idea is to make people save more. It is also intended to make people invest more. This means more pressure on the cashflows, as higher debt service obligations will mount. And, wait for this, equity investors will be more demanding because the cost of capital will shoot through the sky. With higher costs of borrowing, and the consequent increased financial risk for companies, everyone will be careful where he puts his money. So, logically speaking, it should all reduce how much money is in circulation. This is expected to impact inflation and lead to an overall brighter economic outlook. That is, logically speaking.\n\nThe real issue on the table, however, is that we simply must wake up to the fact that expansion of the earning capacity of the economy, through wider commodity options, must compliment the best monetary, or other, policies anyone can design. Out national road infrastructure must come back to motorable life. The insecurity in the land does not conduce to any form of productivity or developmental initiatives. The power sector must be rescued from its current state of \u201cpowerlessness\u201d. We need realistic and sustainable investments in education, health and other social schemes, to save the Nigerian state today. As Emefiele said: \u201cThese problems call for urgent design and steadfast implementation of other supportive, structural, and complementary policies that are broad based, coordinated and focused on complementing the work of the monetary authority.\u201d\n\nAs was said on this page seven months ago, under the title: \u201cWhat the CBN Cannot Do\u201d: \u201cWhen financial outflows into the agricultural sector do not yield the expected returns due to insecurity, the projected gains in terms of food availability, food security and forex earnings from food exports go up in smoke. Thus a \u201csilo\u201d conversation on diversification of the national economy, especially with agriculture in focus, which does not also simultaneously address security and national road and transport infrastructure is an exercise in self-delusion. You do not drive foreign exchange earnings \u2026 when farmers cannot go to their farms.\u201d And it is not the business of the CBN to provide national security, or protect local farmers.\n\nWhile it is true that the CBN\u2019s Anchor Borrowers Programme, among others, has created millions of jobs, taken the youths of many communities, especially rice farming communities, off the crime path and rescued many local economies, it is also true that Nigerians need to better understand what the issues really are. As was said here, back then: \u201cOnly economy-reflating and socially impactful efforts, as seen in such initiatives, in addition to consuming what we produce and producing what we consume, will give us the prospect of bringing up the value of the National Currency and keeping it up\u201d.\n\nA nation with a predominantly consumption-driven economy cannot suddenly catapult itself into the Neverland of foreign exchange El Dorado. You make money from what you produce and sell, or from what you can do and be paid for. You also buy with what you have earned from either goods or services you offered. You get paid nothing when you produce nothing. You spend more than you earn when you produce and sell far less than you buy. The person who produces nothing and earns nothing, but buys a lot, must be getting the money for his purchases from somewhere. If in addition to producing nothings the person also has some savings, then he must be depleting his savings. But what if this person also has no saving, in addition to producing nothing, that means he must be borrowing. And to borrow is to get credit for present needs, with payment deferred to a future date, right? Well, that is our lot in Nigeria today. And we are still borrowing!\n\nWe shall end on the very conclusions drawn and presented by a Non-Partisan RoundTable on pressing national issues, which was organized by Development Specs Academy, and which held on May 19 in Abuja: \u201c(1) Increased productivity is a critical success factor for any nation that wants a strong and stable national currency, (2) Consumption patterns and product preferences have a direct impact on a nation\u2019s Balance of trade, especially with regards to deficits, (3) The Nigerian State, and the citizenry, must consume mostly what they produce and produce mostly what they consume, or retain some of the economic debilities on the table at the moment, (4) the public is only interested in measuring the value of every economic intervention against the background of impact, (5) The operating environment, in our own case an environment where insecurity threatens national productivity in the area of agriculture and food security, can undermine the best policy initiatives and economic intervention programmes.\u201d\n\nThe above conclusions are valid. They reinforce, and reiterate, Emefiele\u2019s repeated calls. Let us pay attention to the things that really matter.",
          "summary": "Thus a \u201csilo\u201d conversation on diversification of the national economy, especially with agriculture in focus, which does not also simultaneously address security and national road and transport infrastructure is an exercise in self-delusion.\nYou do not drive foreign exchange earnings \u2026 when farmers cannot go to their farms.\u201d And it is not the business of the CBN to provide national security, or protect local farmers.\nYou make money from what you produce and sell, or from what you can do and be paid for.\nYou spend more than you earn when you produce and sell far less than you buy.\nBut what if this person also has no saving, in addition to producing nothing, that means he must be borrowing.",

          "title": "Understanding CBN Perspectives on RT200 \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Barnabas Eke\n\nWith the current unstable accruals in the Foreign Exchange (FX) Reserves; dwindling from $39,650 billion in April to $38,540 billion in May 2022, and compounded by the volatile exchange rate of the Naira, the newly introduced monetary policy intervention by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) referred to as \u2018Road To $200 billion\u2019 (RT200), promises to be the masterstroke strategy to shore up the nation\u2019s exchange rate and boost the FX Reserves.\n\nNo doubt, this is one of the manifest efforts, in the recent past, by the CBN to tangibly promote diversification of the economy given that crude oil sale dominates sources of FX inflow to the economy.\n\nThe policy, therefore, gives impetus to investors in the non-oil sector whose products are meant to be exported. Apart from the value addition of these products, they must also comply with international standards before the exporter would be qualified to earn the maximum benefits equal to the earnings of competing exporters of rival products from other countries.\n\nAccording to the CBN policy guidelines for RT200 released in February 2022, it is a non-oil exports proceeds repatriation rebate scheme that is part of the apex bank\u2019s effort to reduce exposure to volatile sources of FX and to earn more stable and sustainable inflows of FX into the country.\n\nThe shift in strategy, at this point, is vital given the fact that the volatility of sources of FX impacts the exchange rate of the Naira, the accruals to FX reserves as well as the inflationary trends in the country.\n\nThe policy \u201caims to raise $200 billion in Foreign Exchange (FX) earnings from Non-Oil Proceeds over the next 3-5years\u201d according to CBN documents. A major anchor of the program is the Non-OIl Export proceeds repatriation Rebate Scheme. The rebate scheme is designed to incentivize exporters in the Non-Oll export sector to encourage repatriation and sale of export proceeds into the FX Market.\n\nThe policy is borne out of the need to mainstream export-bound non-oil sector products as a means of earning more stable and sustainable FX inflows to insulate the Nigerian economy from shocks and FX shortages. The desired outcome would be to enhance Foreign Exchange inflow, diversify the sources of FX inflow, increase the level of contribution of non-oil exports to economic growth and Gross Domestic Product, ensure stability and sustainability of FX inflows, and support export-oriented companies to expand their export operations and capabilities.\n\nIn order to ensure value addition under the non-oil exports, the approved products, goods, and services must be finished and semi-finished goods wholly or partly processed or manufactured in Nigeria, permissible and excluded under the existing export prohibition list.\n\nThe incentives available to qualified companies in the scheme are derived from quarterly payment by the CBN of N65 for every US$1 repatriated and sold at the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 ( I & E) Window to Authorized Dealer Bank (ADB) for other third-party use, and N35 for every US$1 repatriated and sold into (I & E) window for the Exporter\u2019s use on eligible transactions only. Of course, the incentive payments for every dollar repatriated and sold at the designated banks encourage repatriation of profits and discourage capital flights just as it ensures adequate account of repatriated FX to fund economic growth rather than being frittered away in the open FX black market.\n\nHowever, this is not an all-comers\u2019 participation affair. Consequently, there are certain operational safety nets embedded in the scheme to ensure that it is not abused or derailed. It is also designed to boost the revenue base of dedicated exporters of non-oil products, goods, and services through payments of rebates for each repatriated dollar.\n\nOne of the safety nets of the scheme is that although it is categorically stated that \u201cthe CBN (Trade & Exchange Department) shall be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Scheme\u201d, the ADBs are reposed with further gatekeeping functions.\n\nFor instance, all applications/requests for participation are routed through the ADBs which scrutinize them to ascertain compliance with CBN specifications, the veracity of documents submitted, determination of eligibility of products and exporters (applicants), as well as the verification and confirmation of participating exporter (s) due for payment of rebate by the CBN. The exporters must also receive credits on agreed amounts through their accounts domiciled with the ADBs.\n\nThe complementing but overlap of functions between the Apex Bank and the ADBs adds credibility to the overall process. The apex bank is responsible for the policy measures and issuing of updates from time to time while also taking into consideration the recommendations of the ADBs in the process of effecting payment of rebates to beneficiaries.\n\nThe CBN can also impose sanctions on any ADBs found guilty of any infractions or attempts to circumvent the intent of the Scheme. Sanctions may include suspension from the FOREX dealership license for a period of 24 months. The apex bank can also sanction any Exporter who presents fraudulent document(s) in an attempt to undermine the scheme with a ban from accessing the incentive for upwards of 24 months.\n\nThe banks are expected to play pivotal roles in assuring that the policy objectives of RT200 are realized on or before the cut-off time of the scheme in 2026. To this effect, the CBN has reposed on the ADBs the responsibilities of interfacing with the apex bank and Exporters. Under this role, the ADBs oversee that application procedures and eligibility criteria conform with the standards and meet qualifications specified by the apex bank. In other words, ADBs must not only ensure that potential exporters provide verifiable documented proof of their eligibility and that of their products but are also ascertainable and authenticated by the banks for recommendation to CBN. In addition, banks process requests, render periodic reports on disbursements of rebates and make regular recommendations on the operational guidelines to the CBN.\n\nBarely two months after its introduction, statistics released in April 2022 by the Bankers Committee indicate that 150 exporters have repatriated $60 million in export proceeds which qualified them for the quarterly payments of N3.5 billion FX rebate and the rebates have been ordered to be released to them by the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele. This was confirmed by the Managing Director/Chief Executive, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe in her briefs after the Bankers Committee meeting on the performance of the RT200 program in the 1st quarter of 2022.\n\nThe outlook is eliciting positive interest across the industry. To future-proof the scheme, the Director-General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Chinyere Almona, advises the CBN to take cognisance that critical export infrastructure, international trade diplomacy, and adequate funding are prerequisites for sustaining and optimising the scheme.\n\nIt is hoped that similar suggestions will be accommodated by the CBN, and hopefully, constitute parts of the considerations to look out for in the CBN\u2019s future updates on the guidelines.\n\nBarnabas Eke is a financial expert and public affairs commentator based in Lagos",

          "text": "There is disquiet presently in the Nigerian military as some officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army are said to be planning to storm Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, to protest over unpaid emoluments, poor working conditions and others.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the officers and soldiers, mainly those prosecuting the war against insurgency in the North-East and other parts of the country, said they had perfected plans to stage a one-day protest against the leadership of the Nigerian Army.\n\nFile Photo\n\nAccording to the source who pleaded for anonymity, the protest was intended to expose the rot in the operations of the Nigerian Army under General Faruk Yahaya, the Chief of Army Staff.\n\nHe stated that the operations of the Nigerian Army had been marred by ethnic and religious jingoisms that favoured only a segment of the army.\n\n\u201cGeneral Yahaya has done what no other Army Chief has done in the history of the Nigerian Army. He has divided the Nigerian Army along religious and ethnic lines. You are not considered an officer if you do not share a certain faith or religion, which has affected operational efficiency numerous times,\u201d a Colonel told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you this, the present leadership crop of the Nigerian Army is busy making retirement plans. Contracts are shared amongst themselves, monies meant for troops on the battlefront are diverted to private pockets, allowances of soldiers are not paid, and it is generally an atmosphere of delusion in the army as we speak.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the army authorities were making efforts to avert what they tagged the \u201cembarrassment of the year should the soldiers embark on the protest.\u201d\n\nA source added at that the army authorities had issued directives to all Divisions and Commands to withdraw all passes granted to officers and soldiers and direct those already permitted to travel to return to their bases immediately.\n\n\u201cAll commands of the Nigerian Army have been directed to suspend the issuance of a travel pass to officers and soldiers. It was a terse statement from the Army Headquarters some days ago, with a warning to ensure strict compliance,\u201d a captain at the army headquarters also told SaharaReporters.\n\nThis fact was buttressed by the surge in the requests for passes experienced in North-East Nigeria and other areas with ongoing military operations.\n\nA soldier currently engaged in an operation in one of the states in North West stated that the surge in requests for passes was because the bulk of the soldiers in operation had gone through exacerbating conditions in operations.\n\n\"Our allowances are unpaid; we don't have food or water. Maybe our \u201cOgas\u201d in Abuja want us to perform magic. We have not experienced such in the history of the Nigerian Army. Even the police and other paramilitary services are doing better than us. All of this started under General Faruk Yahaya,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a shame for the Nigerian Army. Other people have been Chief of Army Staff before him. Was this how he was treated? Our prayer is for President Buhari to sack him immediately; else there will be problems.\n\n\"The President must do something urgently. I can tell you that there is a rumble in the barracks. The soldiers are not happy. The suffering is too much, and we are now a laughing stock in the Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nEarlier in March, their counterparts in the Nigeria Police Force said they would embark on the warning strike to protest poor working conditions, poor salaries, lack of genuine welfare benefits and outdated weapons.\n\nA protest tagged \u201cWe are tired of negligence\u201d was also scheduled to be held at the Eagles Square in Abuja to reiterate their demands to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe officers had condemned the continuous killing of their colleagues by armed robbers and terrorists, without adequate compensation for their families.\n\nThey had accused the Nigerian government of lying about the increment of police salary and other promised benefits and demanded improved conditions of service, particularly salary increase and provision of modern weapons as they tackle the security challenges facing the country.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Disquiet In Nigerian Army As Officers, Soldiers Plan One-day Protest Over Poor Equipment, Welfare, Corruption Under General Yahaya",
          "text": "There is disquiet presently in the Nigerian military as some officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army are said to be planning to storm Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, to protest over unpaid emoluments, poor working conditions and others.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the officers and soldiers, mainly those prosecuting the war against insurgency in the North-East and other parts of the country, said they had perfected plans to stage a one-day protest against the leadership of the Nigerian Army.\n\nFile Photo\n\nAccording to the source who pleaded for anonymity, the protest was intended to expose the rot in the operations of the Nigerian Army under General Faruk Yahaya, the Chief of Army Staff.\n\nHe stated that the operations of the Nigerian Army had been marred by ethnic and religious jingoisms that favoured only a segment of the army.\n\n\u201cGeneral Yahaya has done what no other Army Chief has done in the history of the Nigerian Army. He has divided the Nigerian Army along religious and ethnic lines. You are not considered an officer if you do not share a certain faith or religion, which has affected operational efficiency numerous times,\u201d a Colonel told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you this, the present leadership crop of the Nigerian Army is busy making retirement plans. Contracts are shared amongst themselves, monies meant for troops on the battlefront are diverted to private pockets, allowances of soldiers are not paid, and it is generally an atmosphere of delusion in the army as we speak.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the army authorities were making efforts to avert what they tagged the \u201cembarrassment of the year should the soldiers embark on the protest.\u201d\n\nA source added at that the army authorities had issued directives to all Divisions and Commands to withdraw all passes granted to officers and soldiers and direct those already permitted to travel to return to their bases immediately.\n\n\u201cAll commands of the Nigerian Army have been directed to suspend the issuance of a travel pass to officers and soldiers. It was a terse statement from the Army Headquarters some days ago, with a warning to ensure strict compliance,\u201d a captain at the army headquarters also told SaharaReporters.\n\nThis fact was buttressed by the surge in the requests for passes experienced in North-East Nigeria and other areas with ongoing military operations.\n\nA soldier currently engaged in an operation in one of the states in North West stated that the surge in requests for passes was because the bulk of the soldiers in operation had gone through exacerbating conditions in operations.\n\n\"Our allowances are unpaid; we don't have food or water. Maybe our \u201cOgas\u201d in Abuja want us to perform magic. We have not experienced such in the history of the Nigerian Army. Even the police and other paramilitary services are doing better than us. All of this started under General Faruk Yahaya,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a shame for the Nigerian Army. Other people have been Chief of Army Staff before him. Was this how he was treated? Our prayer is for President Buhari to sack him immediately; else there will be problems.\n\n\"The President must do something urgently. I can tell you that there is a rumble in the barracks. The soldiers are not happy. The suffering is too much, and we are now a laughing stock in the Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nEarlier in March, their counterparts in the Nigeria Police Force said they would embark on the warning strike to protest poor working conditions, poor salaries, lack of genuine welfare benefits and outdated weapons.\n\nA protest tagged \u201cWe are tired of negligence\u201d was also scheduled to be held at the Eagles Square in Abuja to reiterate their demands to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe officers had condemned the continuous killing of their colleagues by armed robbers and terrorists, without adequate compensation for their families.\n\nThey had accused the Nigerian government of lying about the increment of police salary and other promised benefits and demanded improved conditions of service, particularly salary increase and provision of modern weapons as they tackle the security challenges facing the country.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Forgotten Heroes: How Nigerian Football Club, Kwara United Turned Ex-Players, Staff To Beggars Amid Neglect, Unpaid Entitlements, Ruined Careers",
          "text": "When Abubakar Yusuf, popularly known as Sylas, signed for Kwara United Football Club from Abubakar Bukola Saraki FC in the 2013/2014 season, he dreamt of a more prosperous life where he could meet the needs of his family as a young player.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the club agreed to pay him N250,000 monthly as salary and N2 million as his annual signing-on fee, a contract which lasted for a period of four football sessions.\n\nFrancis' career as Kwara United Player\n\nThe player had it all planned like many others; make some money, make a good name that would attract better offers from clubs abroad. But, despite using his sweat to serve Kwara United for four years, Abubakar has yet to live the life of his dream.\n\n\"For the past four years that Kwara United has terminated my contract, I have had my career stuck. All my efforts to play for another club were not successful.\n\n\"It is like my football career has ended,\" Abubakar said, in a voice laden with grief and hopelessness.\n\nAbubakar Yusuf while playing for Kwara United Abubakar Yusuf while playing for Kwara United\n\nHe continued: \"To take care of my family is now something very difficult. Even if I cannot continue my career as a footballer, Kwara United should pay me my entitlements. The money they owe me is enough (if paid) to start a new life.\"\n\nAbubakar was right. Kwara United still owes him over N4 million from his signing-on fees during his stay at the club.\n\nA signing-on fee is a payment the player gets for signing for a club. This may vary from league to league. The idea is that if the player is at the club for the time set out in his contract, he will receive a set amount.\n\nFrancis Onyegbula is another player whose football career was ruined by Kwara United. He was signed from Dakkada FC in the 2015/16 football season as a central defender.\n\nIn his contract details, the club agreed to pay him N2.5 million as his signing-on fee and N1,000,000 clearance fee for every year.\n\nFrancis was a regular player with the team. He had an average performance of 80 percent throughout his 3 years' stay at the club.\n\n\n\n\"I played three seasons with the team before they terminated my contract in June 2018 due to an injury I sustained while playing for the club,\" Francis told SaharaReporters.\n\nWhen Francis got injured while playing against MFM FC\n\nIt was gathered that Francis with jersey number 31 sustained an injury against MFM FC on 19 January 2018 at Agege Stadium, Lagos. While still nursing this injury, the team injected him to play against Kano Pillars because the club considered him as an important player who must feature in the match.\n\n\"My wound was still there but they called one man to give me an injection because the team needed the match against Kano Pillars so badly.\n\nFrancis' career as Kwara United Player\n\n\"It was during that match with Pillars in April 2018 that I got another injury on the same wound. That was how a promising career ended.\"\n\nDue to the injury, Kwara United subsequently dropped Francis from their squad and despite his pathetic condition, the team neither released his entitlements nor bothered about how to nurse his injury and get him back on the field again.\n\nHence, on Friday, June 10, 2022, Francis held Kwara United players and staff members hostage in Aba when the team went to honour NPFL 2022 matchday 33 against Enyimba. He prevented the team from going out of their hotel for a training session ahead of their Saturday clash.\n\n\"The team owed me N5 million signing-on fee, N3 million as my clearance fee. I have also spent N2.5 million to take care of the injury whereas the club must take care of my injury because I sustained it while playing for them.\n\n\"They killed my career and left me here suffering. I could not secure a contract with another club again due to this injury. I have been nursing it since 2018,\" he said.\n\n'Kwara United Turned Us To Beggars'\n\nAbubakar and Francis are not alone in this hopeless situation. The pain of being hard up was evident in the voice of Hakeem Onigbari. Onigbari was the team captain during his stay with the club. He was dropped from the team at the end of 2018/2019 after spending more than four years with the club.\n\nIt was gathered that the club agreed to pay him N70,000 monthly salary and N3,000,000 annual signing-on fee.\n\n\"The club did pay our salaries but they still owe us our signing-on fees. I was only paid 70 percent of the agreed sum at my first session with the team and since then, the club has not shown serious commitment to pay me my entitlements. They still owe me over N6,000,000.\n\n\"The club has turned most of us to beggars. As a family man, it is very hard to take care of people depending on me.\n\n\"We have appealed to all those concerned, and written to the government and the League Management Company about our plight but nobody really cares about us.\n\n\"We have staged many protests and we won't stop until we get our money,\" he declared.\n\nThe story is just like that of David Ayeni. He was signed from Sokoto United and played for two and a half seasons. He was entitled to N7,500,000 signing-off fee for his service at the club but the club still owes him over N5,000,000.\n\n\"Due to nonpayment of this money, life has been difficult. This is the money I worked for,\" he said.\n\nEven The Dead Are Not Spared\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Kwara United Football Club does not only owe their ex-players who are alive, those who died while playing for the club were also being denied their entitlements.\n\nThe remains of Abdulazeez Saka after he died\n\nThe most notable one was Abdulazeez Saka who slumped and died on Friday, May 26, 2017 during the club's training session.\n\nIt was reported that Saka slumped, unchallenged during their training session on a Friday morning and attempts to revive him were not unsuccessful.\n\nBut five years after his death, the club has yet to release his signing-on fee for the 2016/17 season he signed with the club to his family, a source close to his family confirmed to SaharaReporters.\n\nAbdulazeez Saka\n\nIsmaila Shagari is also being owed his entitlements by Kwara United even in death.\n\nThe former Team Manager, Agboola Basambo and ex-Chief Security Officer of the club, Mr Buki are dead but their ghosts are probably restless, thinking of when their entitlements would be paid by the club they dedicated years of service to. Their relatives are still hoping the team would release their signing-on fees one day.\n\nAgboola Basambo\n\n'I Became Bankrupt Because Of Kwara United Contract'\n\nMr Majin Mohammed was an assistant coach with Kwara United for a period of 2 years (2015-2017). The club promised to pay N5,000,000 for every season he spent with them.\n\nMajin Mohammed\n\n\"Due to this promise, I approached a bank to get a loan with the belief that I would get paid as and when due.\n\n\"I was only paid N2,250,000 during my first season. And the club failed to pay the balance.\n\n\"I became bankrupt due to this contract. I was forced to sell my belongings to repay the loan,\" Mr Muhammad told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother former employee of Kwara United who narrated his ordeal to SaharaReoorters is Coach John Obuh. Obuh was appointed as manager of the club on January 16, 2016 and left his position in March 2018 by mutual consent.\n\nDespite Obuh' achievements with Kwara United FC, he is being owed outstanding signing-on fees estimated at N23,250,000 (Twenty-Three Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira), January 2018 outstanding salary of N500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Naira), match bonuses estimated at N280,000 (Two Hundred and Eighty Thousand Naira), and feeding allowances estimated at about N125,000,000 (One Hundred and Twenty Five Thousand Naira), bringing the total outstanding sum to N24,155,000 (Twenty-Four Million, One Hundred and Fifty - Five Thousand Naira).\n\nHowever, according to a document obtained by SaharaReporters in which the club responded to a letter of complaint filed by the LMC to demand the payment of Obuh's entitlements, the club claimed that N13,450,000.00 was Obuh's entitlements with the club.\n\n\"Despite miraculously changing the terms of the contract, they still failed to clear my debt, they only gave me N3,000,000.00,\" he said.\n\nImpunity\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) NPFL Framework And Rules:\n\n9.45 The terms of a contract between a Club and a Player shall be strictly adhered to and where a club fails to pay remuneration or entitlements due to players for more than sixty (60) days, such Club shall be liable to a deduction of a maximum of six (6) points and a further deduction of three (3) points for every further thirty (30) days for which the remuneration or entitlement remains unpaid.\n\nDespite the incessant breach of this provision by Kwara United, no action was taken by the League Management Company (LMC) against the club.\n\nAccording to an official of the LMC, who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, the club kept promising to clear the debt anytime they were queried by the LMC.\n\n\"But anytime they came to register for a new season, they would still be allowed to register without showing LMC a clear proof that would tell if they have actually fulfilled their promise.\n\n\"The problem is those at the top, once you can buy your way, the law is just there as a formality,\" the source told SaharaReporters.\n\nDocument Shows Kwara United Owes Ex-Players, Staff N250 Million\n\nAccording to a letter written by the Club Secretary, Olowo S. Hamidu, to the State Governor, through; the Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Sports and Youths Development, and obtained by SaharaReporters, the debt owed by the club (as at October 24, 2019) was Two Hundred and Fifty Million, Four Hundred and Thirty-Five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Twenty Five Naira (N250,435,925.00).\n\nThe letter read in part: \"Your Excellency may wish to be informed that the immediate past Administration in agreement with the National Association of Professional Footballers (NANPF) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) approved the sum of Two Hundred and Seventy-Eight Million, Seven Hundred and Forty-Six Thousand, Five Hundred Naira (N278,746,500.00) only as Sign-On Fees for 2013/2014 30% Balance, 2014/2015 100% and 2015/2016 100% for Players and Officials.

Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abeg\u2019s future lies in its rebrand to a social commerce platform",
          "text": "Payment app, Abeg, has rebranded and will now be called PocketApp, a move that underlines its transition from a payment app to a social commerce app. In addition, Abeg, a subsidiary of Piggytech Global Limited, secured approval-in-principle (AIP) for a mobile money operator (MMO) license application from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the scope of its social commerce operations across the country.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Dare Adekoya, Muheez Akanni, Patricia Adoga and Eniola Ajayi-Bembe as a platform that allows users, mostly Gen Z, to send and request money through a wallet-based system, it enjoyed some virality on Twitter due to its catchy name\u2014derived from a Nigerian slag used to ask for favours. It got downloaded 5,000 times in its first 2 weeks. However, it didn\u2019t gain massive prominence until it became headline sponsor of Big Brother Nigeria (BBN), the most-watched reality TV show in Africa, in 2021. Abeg was acquired by Piggytech Global just before the show began airing, and while it entered the show with 20,000 users on its newly launched app, it claimed to have amassed almost 2 million users by the time the show ended. But after blitzscaling to millions of users in a couple of months, its success was trailed by questions about whether it could retain those users.\n\nPiggytech Global co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Joshua Chibueze told TechCabal that PocketApp is the answer to that question. \u201cSo, what we did last year was to get everyone to get the app first. It was very successful, we got over a million users. But this time around, we are going for retention, we\u2019re trying to create a brand or an app that everyone can use. But for now, we\u2019re targeting small micro-businesses and people who sell on Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nPocketApp will support seamless payments and online commerce throughout the country by adding new functionalities for users to buy and sell items via virtual Pocket shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much focused on people being able to open a pocket shop and sell online for free. Over 65% of Piggvest\u2019s current users sell something, it made sense for us because we\u2019re trying to create extra value for our current customers,\u201d Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp has expressed interest in tapping into Nigeria\u2019s social commerce market which is estimated to reach US$23.8 billion by 2028.\n\nThe MMO license will allow the PocketApp to issue e-money, create and manage wallet creation, enable USSD, recruit, manage and pay money to its agent, and manage pool accounts\u2014all of which are central to expanding social commerce.\n\nPocketApp, like MTN and Airtel, who have received similar approvals-in-principle in the past year, also voiced its support to the Nigerian government\u2019s goals for financial inclusion. \u201cPocketApp affirms its commitment to the financial inclusion agenda of the CBN and the Federal Republic of Nigeria and will continue to make it easier for our teeming young population to seamlessly carry out their transactions while saving them costs and giving them more access to get paid,\u201d it said in a statement sent to TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp COO, Patricia Adoga, said that the PocketApp infrastructure has been in the works for over 18 months to enable secure social commerce because social commerce thrives better in a more trusted environment. \u201cSo we added escrow to our payment infrastructure, protecting buyers and sellers and many other features, ensuring a smooth shopping experience on the app,\u201d Adoga said in a statement.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as a full social commerce app, it will connect buyers and sellers across Nigeria, and soon, other African countries. \u201cPeople can discover you from anywhere, as long as you do honest work and you have a smartphone,\u201c Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nChibueze explains that PocketApp hopes to break through geographical limitations and connect sellers and buyers in different parts of the country. \u201cA strawberry trader in Lagos can buy strawberries from a vendor in Jos who has a pocket shop. That way, the price will be way cheaper because you\u2019re dealing with the vendor directly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Nigeria where e-commerce is nascent and people are more comfortable with buying goods physically, e-commerce companies have to build trust with their users. He explains that trust is one of PocketApp\u2019s major offerings. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve solved for commerce is trust. Anybody can sell anything online in the safest way possible. And anybody can sign in now with confidence. Because if you pay for an item, and you\u2019ve not gotten what you want, you\u2019ve got to deliver whatever it is, and always ask for your money back.\u201d\n\nCommenting on PocketApp\u2019s approval-in-principle, co-founder and COO of Piggytech Global, Odunayo Eweniyi, said in the aforementioned statement, \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly pleased that PocketApp has been granted an approval-in-principle as a Mobile Money Operator in Nigeria. We will now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the full operating license, enabling us to continue growing and expanding the scope of our social payments, social commerce and other digital financial products to reach millions of Nigerian micro-entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The Next Wave: How development agencies are investing in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem",
          "text": "June 19, 2022\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, I\u2019ve attended 2 major conferences: VivaTech in Paris and the European Development Days (EDD) in Brussels. During my time at these conferences, I realised that funding and support for African startups and the tech ecosystem don\u2019t just come from investment firms, angel investors, corporates, and tech hubs. There are other players.\n\nIt\u2019s popular to define progress in the African tech ecosystem by the amount of venture funding raised, but the conversations I had made me wonder whether it was also worth measuring this progress in relation to the activities of development agencies and governmental organisations.\n\nPartner Message\n\nYou are invited to an upcoming virtual pitch & conference organized by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Nigeria Office in partnership with Nikkei Inc. Kindly register your interests here.\n\nDevelopment agencies\u2014international and local non-governmental organisations\u2014are tasked with fostering the socio-economic development of different countries, but now more than ever they are realising that leveraging technology is a no-brainer.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC), the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the development of the private sector, might be more popular for financing roads, ports and other infrastructure across Africa but over the past 60 years has been it has invested about $10 billion in the private sector, working with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to create jobs and improve livelihoods. In 2020, it led the World Bank Group #GlobalTechChallenge initiative to match early-stage health tech innovators with healthcare providers in East Africa. Some of these health tech companies were also provided with funding.\n\nSource: Fikayo Idowu, TechCabal Insights.\n\nTo reduce the financing gap women entrepreneurs still face, in January the IFC launched the ScaleX program that incentivises accelerators to help women-led companies in emerging markets raise equity financing by awarding deserving accelerators up to $25,000. Three years after leading a $8.6 million Series A Investment in Africa\u2019s Talking, the IFC recently backed ride-hailing startup Gozem with $10 million to finance 6,000 vehicles in Togo and Benin.\n\nClosely related to this is the work the International Trade Centre does toward making global prosperity a reality by connecting small businesses in developing countries to international markets. This entails that it has projects in Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mali, Uganda, Zambia, and other African countries that focus on the creation of sustainable jobs in the digital technologies sector, and the modernisation of agribusiness through digital technologies.\n\nAdvisory services can play an important role in shaping the allocation of vast amounts of resources. In this vein, the AU-EU D4D Hub primarily aids African governments with strategy formulation and frameworks for digital transformation.\n\nIn the 2 years since it launched, the AU-EU D4D Hub has conducted feasibility studies in Uganda and Rwanda, as well as learning sessions with the Tanzanian government. Germany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) make-IT project develops and implements accelerator and funding programmes across 18 countries on the continent, according to a 2017-2019 impact report\n\nSource: Fikayo Idowu, TechCabal Insights.\n\nWith an estimated number of over 300 million French speakers across 5 continents, the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), which was created in 1970, is increasing its efforts to give francophone African startups more visibility and attract funding.\n\nSenegal\u2019s D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) since 2018 has been investing in the country\u2019s tech environment, granting about 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out and helping transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem.\n\nMany other African country governments like Mauritius, Congo, Tunisia, Ghana, and Rwanda have initiatives to spur the tech ecosystem in their country.\n\nIt can be challenging to quantify the impact of some of these projects and programmes\u2014training sessions or sponsorship of startups to conferences, for example\u2014but they sure lead to business leads and investment opportunities.\n\nThe attention that African startups are receiving from developmental and international agencies is a testament to the capability of these startups to spread innovation and produce tailor-made solutions for some of Africa\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nPartner Message\n\nApplications are now open for the Decentralized Umoja Algorand Bounty Hack III, by Algorand and Reach. The Africa-focused hackathon is an excellent opportunity for developers to learn & build blockchain projects\u2014prizes of up to $6,000 to be won, including a $1,000 participation prize. Applications are open here until 15th July 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBetter awareness of the different players and activities in the African tech ecosystem creates room for collaboration. For instance, during the European Development Days, I witnessed an intro conversation between representatives of the ITC and African European Digital Innovation Bridge (AEDIB) Initiative concerning their projects. The ITC is working on mapping the tech hubs in Africa, while the AEDIB is building digital innovation hubs\u2014a virtual cluster of innovation centres such as tech hubs, research institutes, universities and others in a community. Since they were working on solving a similar problem, at different levels, it created a perfect opportunity for a partnership.\n\nOne way to scale the impact of the investment activities of development agencies in the Africa tech ecosystem is to increase similar partnerships between them and other players such as tech hubs, universities, and research institutes.\n\nFrom the Cabal\n\nHave a great week.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Next Wave. Please share today\u2019s edition with your network on WhatsApp, Telegram and other platforms, and reply to this email to let us know what we can be better at.\n\nSubscribe to our TC Daily Newsletter to receive all the technology and business stories you need each weekday at 7 AM (WAT).\n\nFollow TechCabal on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn to stay engaged in our real-time conversations on tech and innovation in Africa.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi, Senior Writer, TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Comrade Philip Shaibu, has condemned the killing of a Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia, in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area of the State.\n\nShaibu, who led other government functionaries and heads of security agencies in the state, on Monday, to Ikabigbo, called for calm among residents in the community.\n\nThe acting governor also commiserated with the Head of Ikabigbo Community, Aleghe Braimah; family of a member of the Edo Vigilante Network who lost his life in an attempt to rescue the priest, Yusuf Nurudeen, and the Ogieneni of Uzairue, Kadiri Omogbai.\n\nShaibu said he was in the area to commiserate with the Uzairue people and get first-hand knowledge of the incident, noting, \u201cThe unfortunate attack resulted in the killing of Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia at St. Michael Catholic Church, Ikabigbo in Etsako West Local Government Area. I received briefs from eyewitnesses in the community and assured the troubled community that the assailants will be brought to book and made to pay for their crimes.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are pained by the loss of both the reverend father and the member of the vigilante group, who was killed but I am particularly happy with our youth and the vigilante group and the hunters. We also commend the police and the military for their prompt action. We\u2019re very saddened that we lost our loved ones.\n\n\u201cI insisted that we must come to see what has happened for ourselves. We have gotten some information already. Last night, I insisted that the military should remain in the bush to comb the forest. As we speak, they\u2019re still there because we want to make sure that none of the culprits escapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will also look at what has happened here critically because Edo State has been relatively peaceful. We will not allow these miscreants to come into our state and disrupt the peace that we\u2019re already enjoying. Edo will be too hot for them. We will assess what has happened to know how to correct them,\u201d Shaibu noted.\n\nThe Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, assured the community members and relatives of the casualties that the security outfits will not rest until the criminals are brought to book.\n\nHe implored the community to partner with the Police and charged anyone taking actions to work within the ambits of the law to ensure that they do not run afoul of the law.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

To sustain this growth and eventually transform to a world class capital market, transparency and investor confidence is key.\n\n\u201cInvestor confidence will accelerate the growth of our market and increase both domestic and foreign investor participation. To this end, we will continue to support and strengthen the regulator to effectively do its job of regulating and developing the capital market.\n\n\u201cI see the capital market as an important driver of our economic growth objectives and we will continue to support efforts to position our market where it deserves to be \u2013 a capital market that will broaden access to economic prosperity by enabling the emergence of financially responsible citizens, accelerate wealth creation and wealth distribution, provide capital to small and medium scale enterprises, and catalyze housing finance.\n\n\u201cAs you chart the course for the next phase of the Capital Market Master Plan\u2019s implementation, I assure you of this Administration\u2019s support and look forward to working with you and other stakeholders in the financial market to realize the plan\u2019s outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe SEC DG who spoke at the event said through the implementation of the 10-year Nigeria Capital Market Master Plan (2015 \u2013 2025), the Commission and other stakeholders have recorded significant milestones over the years.\n\nYuguda listed some of them to include full dematerialization of certificates, direct cash settlement, recapitalization of CMOs, E-Dividend Mandate Management System, National Savings Strategy to grow domestic risk capital formation, the Roadmap on Enhancing Commodities Trading Ecosystem, Establishment of the West African Securities Regulators Association (WASRA) to encourage integration of capital markets in West Africa, among others.\n\nYuguda said the Master Plan document recommends a periodic review of the assumptions, goals and objectives of the Plan to better align it with current realities and innovations in the global financial system.\n\nAs part of the review, he said the Commission embarked on a comprehensive review of the Plan, driven by PriceWaterHouseCoopers with funding support from Financial Sector Deepening Africa (FSDA).\n\nThe main objective of reviewing the Master Plan, he noted, is to produce an updated version of the document primarily to engage stakeholders on the current level of market development and opportunities for further capital growth; review and update the assumptions and vision of the CMMP and develop targets for the various thematic areas of the CMMP.\n\nOther objectives of the review are to introduce a Strategy Map and Key Performance Indicators for the CMMP and use the Balanced Scorecard Approach for performance measurement; align existing and derive new initiatives based on targets and strategic objectives; develop an implementation plan for initiatives with clear milestones, deliverables, timelines, resource requirements, dependencies, and identify challenges, opportunities and risks associated with the CMMP implementation and recommend ways of effective and more efficient implementation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe comprehensive review of the Master Plan is now complete and a Revised Capital Market Master Plan has been produced.\n\n\u201cThe revised Plan has incorporated the views and aspirations of stakeholders in our market as well as best practices globally to produce a well-articulated strategic plan for the next four years.\n\n\u201cThe revised Capital Market Master Plan is designed to chart the strategic position and future direction of the capital markets, while providing both the SEC and market participants clarity on the vision of the capital market and the road map required to facilitate a conducive business environment to encourage innovation, investment, growth and expansion of economic and employment opportunities in our country.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to be Africa\u2019s most modern, efficient, and internationally competitive market that catalyses Nigeria\u2019s economic growth and development. We believe the Plan provides a solid roadmap for achieving this vision as we collaborate with all our stakeholders under your continued support and proven leadership.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAbout 10,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the July 16th governorship election in the state.\n\nThe defectors included factional chairman of the party, Wale Ojo, former members of the legislature at state and national level and other leaders of the party.\n\nLeading the crowd of defectors was Hon. Ojo; Hon. Albert Adeogun, running mate to the PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke in the 2018 governorship election; Ayodele Asalu (Asler), House of Representatives aspirant in Ede Federal Constituency and Soji Ibikunle, a party stalwart.\n\nThe defectors whose numbers cut across different wards, Local Government Areas and Federal Constituencies of the state, were formally received into the ruling party at the Freedom Park, Osogbo, the state capital, on Tuesday, exactly 18 days to the governorship election.\n\nWhile receiving the defectors, the National Secretary of the APC, Senator Iyiola Omisore, welcomed them for taking a right decision to join the development train of the progressive government in the State.\n\nOmisore who described their choice as noble and thoughtful said they were back into the family that provides an atmosphere of equality and justice.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe have received you wholeheartedly and welcomed you into an atmosphere of equality and justice. We invite you to join hands with us and let us work together for the development of our beloved Osun and our nation\u201d.\n\nAddressing the ecstatic defectors and party faithful, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola commended the new members for taking a bold and decisive step to enhance their political stature, saying that APC is known for fair play.\n\nIn his words: \u201cI congratulate our friends and brothers who have made a critical decision for their political careers and fortunes. You have come at the right time and you have nothing to fear. You are already members, there will be no discrimination whatsoever. Senator Omisore is a testimony that our party values people of substance and gives a fair chance to all\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the defectors, Hon. Wale Ojo attributed their decision to defect to the ruling party to the need to align with a symbol of excellence and progress in Governor Oyetola.\n\n\u201cJoining the opposition in Osun is like joining forces with wasters. Parties that have become serial failures are not worth following for anyone who is serious and driven by excellence. That is why we have come to align with a symbol of excellence and progress in Governor Oyetola\u201d, Ojo said.\n\nCorroborating Ojo\u2019s position, Albert Adeogun, running mate of PDP\u2019s candidate in the 2018 governorship election, lauded Oyetola for bringing stability to the troubled political situation of the state, adding that a vote for Oyetola is a vote for liberation.\n\n\u201cToday, we have come to align with the progressive party to contribute to the great work that is being done. We hail the governor, who in spite of the lean purse of the state has steadied the sinking ship.\n\n\u201cWhen we belonged to the opposition, we had strong campaign messages against APC, but Oyetola has attended to all those issues and taken away the venom of PDP. Every citizen should be informed and guided that a vote for Oyetola is a vote for liberation\u201d, Adeogun added.\n\nAlso, Ayodele Asalu, Soji Ibikunle and Lanre Arogundade, described Oyetola as a faithful and true leader who evidently is in government to serve.\n\nThey also lauded Oyetola for what they described as high-impact infrastructural development which their respective local governments have benefitted from.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye; the Director-General of Oyetola Re-election Campaign Council, Sen. Bashiru Ajibola; Osun APC Chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun; former Osun Deputy Governor, Mrs. Titi Laoye-Ponle; welcomed the new members into the party just as they assured them of equal opportunities.",

Chief Justice well, following many years of meritorious service to the nation and to pray for his good health.\u201d\n\nThe Senate noted that on Tuesday, June 21, 2022, Lawan drew the attention of the Senate to the media reports on the state of affairs in the Supreme Court of Nigeria, whereby Justices of the Court, through a petition signed by majority of them, raised issues bothering on deplorable welfare conditions and difficult working environment for the Justices, which was addressed to the Hon. Chief Justice of Nigeria and Chairman, National Judicial Council.\n\nHe also noted that the President of the Senate emphasised the need for the Senate to urgently step into the matter as any issue that concerns the Judiciary is an issue of urgent national importance that the Senate could not afford to sit idly by and allow to spiral out of control.\n\nAccordingly, the President of the Senate directed the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to get involved in the matter with a view to unravelling the root cause of the recent development in the Judiciary and how best the Senate can intervene in order to address the concerns raised by the Justices.\n\nAccording to Lawan, Justices were taciturn and reticent in handling issues outside their judicial domain but resorting to such measures in order to protect the Judiciary, required the Senate to rise up to the occasion to ensure that their demands were addressed.\n\nThe committee chairman, Senator Bamidele said his team was taking steps to look into the matter as directed by the President of the Senate by making arrangements to interface with relevant stakeholders both at the Bar and on the Bench.\n\nBamidele said, \u201cThe poor welfare of Judicial Officers would affect the delivery of the judiciary in respect of their output and will prevent them from performing optimally.\n\n\u201cThe sacred image of the Judiciary, which is the epicentre of the temple of justice should be preserved by the Senate through appropriate legislative measures in order to safeguard this highly revered institution and prevent it from being ridiculed.\u201d\n\nBamidele added that it is a regret that the Hon. Chief Justice of Nigeria, Hon. Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammed on Sunday, June 27, 2022, voluntarily resigned his appointment on grounds of ill-health, leaving the most senior Justice to act as the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria. However, this development would not prevent the Committee from going ahead with its assignment in the quest to find a probable lasting solution to the matter.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThough Hon. Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammed has stepped down as CJN, most of the issues raised by the Justices of the Supreme Court and other stakeholders within the Judiciary, still remain and need to be addressed urgently to prevent an eventual shutdown of the Judiciary.\u201d",

President Buhari made the promise to inaugurate the NDDC Board when he received in audience the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) in Aso Rock, Abuja.\u201d\n\nAt that occasion, President Buhari said that \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\nNDEF recalled that the Ijaw National Congress (INC) has been compelled to describe the delay in the inauguration of the NDDC Board as a \u201cclear betrayal of trust and display of state insensitivity on the Ijaw nation and Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nOgbogbula quoted the Niger Delta United Congress (NDUC), as stating that the position of INC \u201crepresents the collective position of Niger Deltans, not the subterfuge from a puppet and beneficiary of the current illegality in NDDC who unabashedly sings the deleterious tunes of his paymasters to suppress Niger Deltans and deprive them of the benefits accruing from their God-given natural resources.\u201d\n\nThe Elders\u2019 Forum, therefore, wondered on \u201cwhat authority is Udengs Eradiri making his outlandish statements which have become a huge embarrassment to President Buhari and the Federal Government, a reason why we call on the Federal Government to call him to order and sanction him accordingly, to teach him a lesson and also act as a deterrent to other government appointees who will be tempted to make statements that they do not have the authority to make.\u201d\n\nNDEF also stated that \u201cto educate and enlighten Udengs Eradiri and others like him who seek to confuse gullible Niger Deltans and other Nigerians, NDDC is regulated by its establishment Act which clearly stipulates how the agency should be governed. The ongoing contraption of administering the Commission by a Sole Administrator is a violation of the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cwhat the NDDC Act provides is that the Board and Management (Managing Director and two Executive Directors) of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, the current Sole Administrator (Effiong Akwa), or his Special Adviser (Udengs Eradiri) are not recognized by the law setting up NDDC, the NDDC Act, and therefore lack the authority, and even moral standing to begin to pontificate on the appropriateness or otherwise of a subsisting law which he and his master currently violate. So, on whose authority and permission is he, an illegal occupier of an office, making such a policy statement affecting an entire region of nine constituent states?\u201d\n\nThe group noted that the framers of the NDDC Enabling Act of 2000 made adequate provisions for proper corporate governance, accountability, probity, checks and balances in the administration of the interventionist Commission.\n\nOgbogbula also drew attention to the reaction of a former Attorney General of Akwa Ibom State, Barr Uwemedimo Nwoko to the above Vanguard Newspaper story, wherein he stated that \u201cthe presidency does not have the power to stop executing any provision of an existing Act, which the National Assembly has not amended. They do not have the power, which is why I said it is a violation. Extant laws must be obeyed.\u201d\n\nHowever, NDEF said it was saddened that what has \u201csubsisted in NDDC for the past two years is that there is an illegal sole administrator who is both Managing Director, Executive Director of Finance, and Executive Director Projects, in clear breach of NDDC Act which ensures separation of these duties to ensure checks and balances.\u201d\n\nThe group maintained that the continued administration of the NDDC by an Interim Sole administrator (Effiong Akwa) is \u201cillegal because the NDDC Act has no provision for this illegality as the NDDC Act only provides that the Board and Management (Managing Director and two Executive Directors) of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, nobody is supposed to begin to administer the NDDC and utilise the huge funds accruing to it on a monthly basis without passing through this legal requirement as stipulated in the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nOgbogbula further remarked that beyond calling Udengs Eradiri to order and \u201cproperly sanctioning him for his embarrassing utterances of denigrating the nation\u2019s subsisting law, President Buhari should also be concerned about the disdain of the Niger Delta people over the manner he has handled the NDDC, most especially administering the Commission with illegal interim management/sole administrator contraptions for five years in his seven years in office, and therefore needs to end the ongoing illegality in NDDC if he is to be remembered for good in the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nThe group recalled that recently an APC group, \u201cCommitted members of the APC from the Niger Delta Region,\u201d cautioned that \u201cgiven the various encounters our presidential aspirants had with party delegates from Akwa Ibom, Abia, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, to Rivers states, our party should no longer be in doubt about the mood of the people of the region with regard to their genuine angst towards the Federal Government for the way we have been badly treated by certain elements in the Federal Government who feed fat on the resources of our region.\u201d They specifically pointed out that \u201cas it stands, the APC cannot win an election in the region except the missteps in NDDC are remedied and the NDDC substantive Board is inaugurated in accordance with the law setting up the Commission.\u201d\n\nAccording to NDEF, \u201cwhile we restate our condemnation of the flippant outburst of Udengs Eradiri and his boss Effiong Akwa to try and justify the ongoing illegality in NDDC, we align with the demands of authentic Niger Delta stakeholders and urge President Buhari to end the illegal sole administratorship at the NDDC; inaugurate the NDDC Governing Board in line with the NDDC Act to represent the nine constituent states, and thereby ensure proper corporate governance, checks and balances, accountability, transparency, and probity in managing the Commission.\u201d",

Fr.

Christopher Odia of Auchi Diocese and Bitrus Borigo of Kaduna Archdiocese, including the mauling of over 40 worshippers at Owo, Ondo State, at different times, the group wondered why the bandits have suddenly picked interest in harassing, and killing harmless clergy and innocent worshippers who pose no danger or obstacle to anyone, rather than their desire to draw nearer to their creator.\n\nThey called on the security agencies at the federal and state levels and across all formations to intensify efforts to bring the killers to book, while also intensifying efforts to safeguard the lives of the citizens.\n\nSIGNIS Nigeria equally challenged the legislative arm of government across all levels to explore the possibility of enacting a law that would enable Nigerians to own arms to defend themselves and their families against arbitrary attacks by gunmen as is now being championed by the Zamfara State government.",

          "text": "The trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu will resume on Tuesday, June 28, at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, warned that security agents must stop harassing those who would come to show solidarity with the IPOB leader at the court.\n\nEjiofor argued that there had been several high-profile trials involving prominent Nigerians, with supporters thronging the court premises in solidarity, who were not intimidated by the security agencies.\n\nThis is even as he advised the supporters to be civil in their approach while at the court premises.\n\nHis statement reads, \u201cWe conducted our routine court-Ordered visit to our indefatigable Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu at the DSS Headquarters.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s visit was unique because it was basically to harmonise the final legal strategy for tomorrow\u2019s outing. Onyendu is fully prepared for his Court appearance tomorrow, and he is in good spirit. We are confident that justice will be done tomorrow too.\n\n\u201cOnyendu thanked millions of his supporters and UmuChineke for standing shoulder to shoulder with him thus far. However, Onyendu is particularly worried over the continued incarceration of Mrs. Ukamaka Ejezie (Mama Biafra), whose only offence was daring to be in Abuja in solidarity with him.\n\n\u201cThe legal team is aggressively exploring all permissible legal frameworks to ensure Mama Biafra\u2019s release. As you may be aware, the Court has fixed the 20th day of July 2022, for definite hearing of the application we filed for her release.\n\n\u201cMay we respectfully, use this medium to appeal to Onyendu\u2019s followers, supporters and well-wishers, who intend coming to Court tomorrow in solidarity with Onyendu, to please maintain absolute civility in their conduct, as have always demonstrated.\n\n\u201cIt is possible you all may not be accommodated within the precinct of the Court, but you could organise yourselves outside the Court premises and remain peaceful, as always.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the Law Enforcement Agencies are reminded once again, that the Court environment is not a police barrack nor an environment reserved for only security operatives. The Court is a public place meant for everyone.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are appealing to the respective law enforcement agencies that will provide security in and around the Court premises tomorrow not to harass, intimidate, and/or arrest innocent civilians for coming to court in solidarity with Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cMay we remind you that we have witnessed several high profile trials involving prominent Nigerians from other divides, where their loved ones thronged the Court premises in solidarity, but nobody was either intimidated, arrested or molested.\n\n\u201cA case in hand is the trial of the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, which has continued to witness outrageous number of sympathisers who have never been molested, arrested or intimidated. Therefore, we expect utmost decorum in and around the Court tomorrow.\n\n\u201cDear UmuChineke, please be reminded that your prayers and supplications are impacting positively, and they are needed now, as always. Do not relent until the final victory.\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic for a very fruitful outing tomorrow. With God on our side, Victory is assured. The hour has come!\n\n\u201cMay you all remain richly blessed. Forward ever, in victory and backward never.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) on Tuesday said they will drive the Labour Party (LP) candidate Peter Obi campaign to ensure he emerge the next president of Nigeria come 2023.\n\nSpeaking during their separate address at the auditorium of Pascal Bafyau Labour House to mark the 10th anniversary lecture of late labour leader, Pascal Bafau, both presidents of NLC and TUC, Comrades Ayuba Wabba, and Quadri Olaleye said the LP candidate is among the finest Nigerians as well as the first to be adopted by labour.\n\nAccording to Comrade Wabba, \u201cNLC is solidly behind Labour Party and will fully mobilise to ensure the victory of the party come 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nHe also recalled that workers\u2019 unions have realised that strikes and protests alone cannot change the narratives in Nigeria, especially regarding to workers\u2019 welfare and fair treatment to the working people, hence labour must venture fully into politics and work hard to support candidates whose mantra will make life better for their members and Nigerians at large.\n\nHis TUC counterpart, Comrade Quadri Olaleye, said that Mr Obi is a face among the presidential candidates which labour unions were pleased and are ready to work with.\n\nHe said the entire labour movement has accepted, adopted and will support, and ensure workers massively vote for him in the 2023 presidential elections.\n\nThe TUC President further said Labour Party is stronger, one and formidable, adding that the party has a widespread structure, as there is a worker and a member of either TUC and NLC in every family across Nigeria.\n\nHe insisted that Labour Party is the only party for Nigerian workers.\n\nObi in his address said his visit to the leadership of the two labour centres was not to campaign but for a courtesy call; to honour the Organised Labour on whose party and interest he is seeking Nigerians vote in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cMy commitment is to move Nigeria from consumption to production and you can\u2019t talk about production without labour. Labour is the engine of production, capital and machine can do anything but labour is what makes it work. Because labour is the greatest contributor to production, it has to be properly remunerated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you how bad things are in this country today. If you are on wages, today Nigerians spend 100 percent of their wages on just feeding. So many don\u2019t even know where their next meal will come from. They pay to train their children only for them finish school and stay at home without work.\n\n\u201cThese are issues we need to discuss about. Nobody can be president without sitting down with the labour organisation to decide the future of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe can nolonger have a situation where the leaders are here and workers are there. They must sit on the same table and talk. That is the beginning of the solution, that is what is happening all over the world.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not a producing country. The collective effect of what we are suffering today is bad leadership. We have a leadership that concentrates on sharing. So you have to move from sharing formula to production formula.\n\n\u201cThis is a country of 200 million people sitting on 923,000 square kilometers of land. They can\u2019t feed themselves, they can\u2019t export anything.\n\n\u201cTotal Nigeria\u2019s export including oil is under $2 billion for 200 million population. A similar country, not a first world country, one with the same tragectory with Nigeria in the year 2000, Vetnam, sitting on 331,000 square kilometers of land, a third of Nigeria\u2019s land space and 100 million population, with half of Nigeria\u2019s population, their total earnings last year was $ 312 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "FBNHoldings Plc recently held its annual general meeting to present financial account to shareholders. In this report AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at FBNHoldings outstanding performance and other strategies adopted to sustain its profitability in 2021 financial year.\n\nThe slow recovery of the nation\u2019s economy following the outbreak of COVID -19 which hit the world economy in 2020 has continued to have negative impact on the growth of business in Nigeria. This situation affected every sector of the economy, including financial service sector.\n\nBut despite the high level economic disruptions , tough operating environment experienced in the country, the FBNHoldings Plc has remained focused on value addition and leveraged its human and financial resources to deliver remarkable returns to Its shareholders.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe group delivered higher topline revenues year-on-year closing the 2021 financial year with gross earnings of N757.3 billion, a 28.2 per cent growth driven by significant growth in Non-Interest Income of 96.1 per cent.\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s audited financial result, profit before tax rose by 99.1 per cent to N166.7 billion from N83.70 billion reported in the corresponding period of last year, while profit after tax rose by 68.37 per cent to N151.079 billion from N89.730 billion recorded in the comparative period of 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the group said it operated in a challenging environment pressured by high inflation and currency devaluation, the effect of which increased operating expenses by 14.2 per cent to N334.2 billion as against N292.5 billion reported in December 31, 2020.\n\nAlthough 14.2 per cent is below the inflationary level of December 2020 that stood at 15.6 per cent, the regulatory cost also rose during the period, increasing by 23.2 per cent year-on-year.\n\nNotwithstanding the inflationary push factors, operating income grew by 35.5 per cent to N592.8 billion from N437.6 billion reported in the preceding year, resulting in an improvement in cost to income ratio to 56.4 per cent from 66.8 per cent recorded in 2020.\n\nIt assured the investors that \u201cgoing forward, we will sustain our focus towards improving efficiency by containing cost and increasing revenue,\u201d adding that total assets grew by 16.2 per cent year-on-year to N8.9 trillion from N7.7 trillion in 2020.\n\nTh management further said this was driven by a 30.0 per cent year-on-year increase in customer loans and 26.3 per cent increase year-on-year in investment securities.\n\nAlso, cash and balances with Central Banks, loans to banks & customers and investment securities constitute 87.2 per cent of total assets as against 83.4 per cent in the comparative period.\n\nThe group said deposit from customers which increased by 19.5 per cent year-on-year to N5.9 trillion from N4.9 trillion, reaffirmed strong market access and robust funding base.\n\n\u201cOur investment in agent banking, digitalisation and deployment of digital platforms which our customers have adopted, improved customer penetration and deepened our solid retail franchise. This continues to provide us with access to stable funding, reducing our cost of fund ratio to 2.1 per cent from 2.3 per cent reported in December 2020 while supporting the float of our current and savings account (CASA) at 91.2 per cent,\u201d the group said.\n\nCommercial Banking\n\nAlso, the group\u2019s result showed that commercial banking subsidiary, FirstBank of Nigeria Limited contributed highest in the group performance, posting profit after tax of N117.8 billion as against N67.8 billion in 2020, representing 73.9 per cent growth.\n\nSimilarly, profit before tax grew by 77.9 per cent year on year to N130.9 billion from N73.6 billion in preceding year, gross earnings up by 30.3 per cent year on year to N716.8 billion from N550.3 billion in the preceding year, while total assets went up by 16.9 per cent to N8.5 trillion, from N7.4 trillion in 2020.\n\nThe bank said \u201cthis performance was driven by a relentless focus on the needs of customers and improving the competitiveness of our offerings. We have sharpened our \u2018Go To Market\u2019 approach to better leverage the opportunities which our large scale provides in addition to becoming more relevant to our clients by improving our value propositions.\u201d\n\nMerchant banking & Asset management\n\nOn the part of Merchant Banking and Asset Management section, the report showed that FBNQuest group gross earnings grew by 8.5 per cent to N42.5 billion while profit before tax declined by 17.3 per cent year-on-year to close at N9.8 billion. The group said its focus on annuity and fee income-driven businesses led to a growth of 14.6 per cent in non-interest revenue year-on-year.\n\nHowever, net interest Income declined by 30.5 per cent year-on-year due to lower yields on assets and a higher cost of funds, and profitability was also impacted by a 20.7 per cent growth in operating expenses.\n\nThe management said \u201cthe Investment Management (IM) Group continues to\n\nperform strongly, contributing 32.0 per cent of gross earnings.\u201d In 2021 in particular, FBNQuest Asset Management said it contributed 14.4 per cent to gross earnings, adding that the IM group\u2019s contribution to revenue is a 3.8-percentage point increase from the previous year.\n\nAdeduntan, Okonkwo, Abdullahi on performance\n\nCommenting on the performance of the group, Chief Executive Officer of FirstBank, Dr. Adesola Adeduntan said: \u201cFollowing years of strategic restructuring of the Bank\u2019s balance sheet and operations, the Commercial Banking business is beginning to transition into a sustained growth phase delivering performance commensurate to the size of our business and capabilities of our people.\u201d\n\nTo mitigate the effect of the low interest rate on investment securities and revenue generation, he said, \u201cwe remained deliberate with our intensified deposit mobilization and funding strategy to support enhanced loan growth at optimised rates leading to a 5.7 per cent increase in interest expense to N140.8 billion from N133.2 billion reported in the comparative period.\u201d\n\nAddressing shareholders at the annual general meeting, Group Managing Director FBNHoldings Nnamdi Okonkwo said: \u201cAt the beginning of the financial year, the group set out to achieve three critical strategic priorities which include enhancing non-funded revenue generation capabilities by accelerating customer-led innovation, upscaling comparative adjacencies, and seizing new local and regional opportunities as they present themselves, drive technology-led efficiency by consolidating the gains from our digital offerings and extracting value from our digital ecosystem and accelerate digitisation of critical-to-business processes leveraging robotics and expansion of our digital-only propositions locally and across our regional subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further,he said , \u201cOur continued investments in next-generation technological capabilities continue to provide foundational support for our overarching digitisation strategy.\n\n\u201cIn the last 12 months, the group has delivered digital alternatives to customers through self-service platforms, significantly reduced the cost-to serve of key customer segments, and ultimately enriched the customers\u2019 experience across various digital touch points by leveraging our Digital innovation Laboratory and our strategic partnerships in the Fintech space.\n\n\u201cAt the operational level, our machine learning and robotic capabilities have been instrumental in eliminating non-revenue accreting and repetitive tasks, thereby creating the opportunity for more members of staff to pursue more productive revenue-generating activities for the group.\u201d\n\nGroup Chairman of FBNHoldings Plc, Alhaji Ahmad Abdullahi said: \u201cWe have remained at the forefront and continued to champion the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion agenda with an agent banking network of over 167,0001 agents located in 772 of the 774 local governments in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur unique multi-business delivery model places us in a vantage position to leverage the inherent synergies between Strategic Business Units to create unparalleled value across sectors and customer segments domestically, regionally, and internationally. One of the outcomes of these collaborative efforts is the generation of N20.8 billion in 2021, purely from the conversion of synergistic opportunities within the Group.\n\n\u201cIndeed, total synergy revenues have grown by 21 per cent in the last eight years, on a compounded annual growth basis from N5.5 billion since 2014. We have activated additional policies and processes to enhance the group\u2019s capabilities to generate incremental revenues from cross-entities collaboration across regions leveraging the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement. These successes have been enabled by our most valuable assets, our staff, without whom we would not have achieved these feats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe changes and restructuring within the group in recent years were informed by our singular ambition of returning to the premier position in the financial services sector across Nigeria and Sub Sahara Africa (SSA). Technology will continue to disrupt how we develop and deliver financial services.\n\n\u201cWith the growing acceptance and popularity of digital banks, the bank and financial institutions of the future are those that will leverage technology and group ecosystem to deliver a seamless customer experience.\n\n\u201cAs a forward-looking financial services group, we have made and continue to make significant investments in the technology that will drive our growth and successes and enable us to face the challenging competitive environment with confidence.\n\n\u201cOur extensive platforms, large customer base, solid franchise, and scale of services make the FBNHoldings a partner of choice for Fintechs who are naturally inclined to connect with institutions with the right network for growth.\n\nWe remain determined to stay ahead of the innovation curve and will continue to leverage our innovation hub to develop next-generation solutions that will help the Group remain top-of-mind and deliver second-to-none customer service across our traditional and virtual networks,\u201d Abdullahi further said.\n\nIn all , the group said it \u201cremains committed to enhancing its financial performance, growing market share, nurturing our human capital and leveraging digital technology to serve our customers better. We will continue to explore opportunities to optimise\n\nour operations in order to increase customer satisfaction and grow annuity income as we look to maximum productivity in 2022.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

As you are all aware, during the consideration for the mode primary, there are so many issues that came up with divergent views. The clause had to be removed to allow parties adopt any method it is comfortable with. After the conclusion of the primaries, some members of the National Assembly who failed to return blamed the method of primary adopted. So many of them feel they should seek reelection under another party. But I feel at the end of the day, APC will come out stronger>\u201d\n\nReacting to the implication of defection for APC, the Lagos West lawmaker said he is confident that the ruling All Progressives Congress is already working on how to resolve the matter. \u201cI want to say the defection may affect APC but we are still in the majority. We are 62 in number. With 62 senators and majority in the Reps, we are still in the majority and there is no cause for alarm. And also, for those who have defected, talks are still ongoing to bring them back to their party to see how they can be accommodated in various ways. The presidential candidate of our party, Asiwaju bola Ahmed Tinubu had also met the lawmakers before his trip to France with assurances that everyone will be accommodated.\u201d\n\nOgun West Politics\n\nSenator Solomon, who is also the Ogun West senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress in 2023, also spoke about his victory at the primary and issues arising from it. \u201cI won the primary convincingly in the last primary election that was conducted in Ogun west and this was not as a result of what happened overnight, it has been efforts put together in the last 15 years since I have decided to return to my root. It is possible with the support of God almighty, the support of the governor and the support of all members of the party. And you can see from the result, I won convincingly, the entire 294 delegates decided to vote for me, that shows I am on ground, that shows I am the candidate to beat in the primaries. So, for those who have gone to court. Like I said, this is the time of the season that everybody would want to engage in one activities or the other but there\u2019s no locus standing because the electoral act is clear on that because before you can go to court, you must be involved in the process. The purpose in which they have gone to court is still not yet known but our lawyers are there studying the paper. The truth is that I won the election convincingly and my people are with us. We are only looking forward to the general election in February and by the grace of God we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on people\u2019s reaction to his Ogun West ambition, the Lagos Senator thanked them for showing concerns about his political sojourn. \u201cWhatever school of thought anyone has shared about my movement, I want to thank them very much because that shows I have done something while serving the people of Lagos west. And I felt serving my people in Ogun West is not also a bad decision. I have know regret and I want to assure you that the same support I enjoy while representing Lagos West, I will enjoy same when I would be representing Ogun West in the 10th Assembly. So, by and large, I am happy, I am in good stay and I am focused. I am looking ahead to the campaign ahead of me and also assure the good people of Lagos, that, yes I am back home, I am serving the people of Ogun West but I would be there at anytime when they need my attention going into the future.\u201d\n\nWhy I switched\n\nOn why he switched to Ogun West, Senator Solomon said his decision is purely about his people and nothing more. \u201cMy decision to go back home is about my people, And I did a wider consultation both in Lagos and in Ogun. I also want to say that there\u2019s no ulterior motive or major reason but I just felt that I have done well and I am okay having served Lagos for so many years. Let me go back to my root to contribute my own quota towards the development of my people. I want to thank Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and governor Dapo Abiodun for their support and encouragement. I want to say there\u2019s no regret or major reason switching to Ogun West.\u201d\n\nGovernorship ambition\n\nWhile reacting to insinuations that the Lagos Senator relocated to Ogun in order to pursue his governorship ambition, Yayi as he is fondly called by his admirers, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the future, I want to allow the future to talk about itself but for now, I am here to represent the people of Ogun west after the 2023 elections and not going in for governorship that is not a discussion before me now. I want to believe that what is before me now is the senatorial election. With the support of the people, my governor, I will come out victorious.\u201d\n\nNinth Assembly and Rubber stamp allegation\n\nThe ninth national Assembly has often been described as a rubber stamp by many, but the chairman of the Senate committee on Finance vehemently objected to this. He queried what the proponents of the concept imply by what \u201crubber stamp.\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know what their definition of their so called rubber stamp is. I want to belief the National Assembly is made of men and women who are distinguished Nigerians and who have the rights to take their own decisions on what comes before them. And I want to believe if supporting the policies and programmes of your party so that the party can bring about meaningful development to the people is what they call rubberstamp, I don\u2019t have apology about that. If timely passage of appropriation bill is rubber stamp, I don\u2019t have apology about that. I don\u2019t know what they call the so-called rubber stamp, if what they call rubber stamp is to be at loggerheads with the executive is their meaning of rubber stamp, I don\u2019t understand. Even in developed democracies across the world, there\u2019s bipartisan where both opposition and ruling parties come together on an issue that affect them.. The issue of rubber stamp should not come but rather we should be seen given enough cooperation to the executive to bring development.\u201d\n\nThe Third Force Option: NNPP and Labour\n\nSpeaking on the development of NNPP and Labour party as third force option, the Lagos senator said it is good for Nigeria\u2019s democracy but noted that politics is about structure and spread. \u201cI know they\u2019re trying to bring the third force and I hope we are not having the fourth force. It is good for our democracy and I strongly believe they\u2019re bringing to the table what the other two political parties are not bringing, but you know Politics is about structures, spread and the people. And I think if you go into the National Assembly now, NNPP has one senator, Labour too has one. I don\u2019t know their number in the House of Representatives. They are welcome if they choose to be the third force. But for us in APC, with our Presidential candidate, I know we are good to go, For PDP, I don\u2019t know their plan or agenda. I know it would be difficult for NNPP or Labout or any party to upstage the APC. To a large extent we are prepared, everybody will sell their manifesto and I know this time around, Nigerians are going to vote not only for party, but the candidate.\u201d\n\nTinubu and APC Primary\n\nSpeaking on the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives, Senator Solomon said the APC chieftain emerged victorious because he did his homework very well and the delegates believed in him. \u201cThere\u2019s no much underhand play or anything that transpired other that Asiwaju Tinubu did his homework very well and also the delegate were convinced that this time around he (Tinubu) should be the one to fly the flag of the party. You he has been there before. He\u2019s one of the founding fathers and he\u2019s a national leader of the party. A lot of us that came out to support him know that he has done so much to become the presidential candidate of the party. I believe we rather thank the delegate for voting him and those who worked from behind the scene.\u201d\n\nReconciliation\n\nThe Lagos West senator said in a bid to consolidate on the success of the primary, reconciliation moves are ongoing to bring back aggrieved party members. \u201cI want to say that APC for now across the divide are coming together more than ever before. For instance in the Southwest, I know hardly would you see anybody saying anything different. And the presidential candidate himself had met with all aspirants who contested with him. That is a sign of reconciliation and they have all pledged their support. In the Southwest, if there\u2019s any issue ,it is not about the presidential, that should be at state level and we are trying to resolve everything.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Lagos West Senator said its committee is guided by the fiscal responsibility act in approving borrowings for the federal government, adding that there are thresholds it must adhere to.\n\u201cWhatever school of thought anyone has shared about my movement, I want to thank them very much because that shows I have done something while serving the people of Lagos west.\nAnd I felt serving my people in Ogun West is not also a bad decision.\nI have know regret and I want to assure you that the same support I enjoy while representing Lagos West, I will enjoy same when I would be representing Ogun West in the 10th Assembly.\nI don\u2019t know what they call the so-called rubber stamp, if what they call rubber stamp is to be at loggerheads with the executive is their meaning of rubber stamp, I don\u2019t understand.",

          "title": "Trump Wanted to Join January 6 Capitol Riot, Tried to Grab Limo Steering Wheel",
          "text": "Donald Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of his presidential limousine on Jan. 6, 2021, when his security detail declined to take him to the U.S. Capitol where his supporters were rioting, a former aide testified on Tuesday.\n\nThe then-president dismissed concerns that some supporters gathered for his fiery speech outside the White House that day carried AR-15-style rifles, instead asking security to stop screening attendees with magnetometers so the crowd would look larger, the aide testified.\n\n\u201cTake the effing mags away; they\u2019re not here to hurt me,\u201d Cassidy Hutchinson, a top aide to Trump\u2019s then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, quoted Trump as saying that morning.\n\nTrump struggled with Secret Service agents who insisted he return to the White House rather than join supporters storming the Capitol where Congress was meeting to certify his rival Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s victory, Hutchinson testified.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m the effing president. Take me up to the Capitol now,'\u201d Hutchinson quoted an enraged Trump as saying. She said Trump tried from the back seat to grab the steering wheel of the heavily armored presidential vehicle.\n\nIt was one of several of Hutchinson\u2019s disclosures in testimony at the sixth day of House hearings into the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol assault by Trump\u2019s followers, roused by his false claims his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.\n\nOn social media Trump denied having grabbed the wheel.\n\n\u201cHer Fake story that I tried to grab the steering wheel of the White House Limousine in order to steer it to the Capitol Building is \u2018sick\u2019 and fraudulent,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media app.\n\nDozens of courts, election officials and reviews by Trump\u2019s own administration rejected his fraud claims, including outlandish stories about an Italian security firm and the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez tampering with U.S. ballots.\n\nFour people died the day of the attack, one fatally shot by police and the others of natural causes. More than 100 police officers were injured, and one died the next day. Four officers later died by suicide.\n\nAt the end of about two hours of testimony, Representative Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the nine-member House panel, presented possible evidence of witness tampering and obstruction of justice.\n\nShe showed messages to unidentified witnesses advising them that an unidentified person would be watching their testimony closely and expecting loyalty.\n\nRepublican Mick Mulvaney, who served as Trump\u2019s chief of staff before Meadows, said on Twitter: \u201cThere is an old maxim: it\u2019s never the crime, it\u2019s always the cover-up. Things went very badly for the former President today. My guess is that it will get worse from here.\u201d\n\nHutchinson told the committee that Meadows and Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani had sought pardons from Trump.\n\nThe hastily called hearing marked the first time this month, during six hearings, that a former White House official appeared for live testimony.\n\nSpeaking in soft but assured tones, Hutchinson painted a picture of panicked White House officials bristling at the possibility of Trump joining what was to become a violent mob pushing its way into the Capitol, hunting for then-Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers who were then certifying the victory of Biden over the Republican Trump.\n\nTheir worries focused on the potential criminal charges Trump and others could face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get charged with every crime imaginable,\u201d Hutchinson said White House counselor Cipollone told her if Trump were to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\u201c\u2018We need to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen, this would be a really terrible idea for us. We have serious legal concerns if we go up to the Capitol that day,'\u201d Cipollone said, Hutchinson testified.\n\nHutchinson, who sat doors away from Trump\u2019s Oval Office, testified that days before the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Meadows knew of the looming violence that could unfold.\n\n\u201c\u2018Things might get real, real bad on Jan. 6,'\u201d she quoted him as saying inside the White House on Jan. 2 with her boss.\n\nShe testified that Giuliani had said of Jan. 6: \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to the Capitol, it\u2019s going to be great. The president\u2019s going to be there; he\u2019s going to look powerful.'\u201d\n\nAt that point, she told the House committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans: \u201cIt was the first moment that I remembered feeling scared and nervous of what could happen on Jan. 6.\u201d\n\nThis month\u2019s hearings featured videotaped testimony from figures including Trump\u2019s oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and his former attorney general, Bill Barr. They and other witnesses testified that they did not believe Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud and tried to dissuade him of them.",

          "text": "Firefighters on Tuesday searched the rubble of a Ukrainian shopping mall where authorities said 36 people were missing after a Russian missile strike that killed at least 18, as a regional governor reported another \u201cenemy attack\u201d further east.\n\nThe attack in the central city of Kremenchuk and the reported strike in the Dnipropetrovsk region were far from any frontlines. The mall attack drew a wave of global condemnation, with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron calling it a \u201cwar crime\u201d.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nUkraine said Moscow had killed civilians deliberately in Kremenchuk. Russia said it had struck a nearby arms depot and falsely claimed that the mall was empty.\n\nThe governor of Dnipropetrovsk said rescue workers were searching for people under rubble in the region\u2019s main city, Dnipro.\n\nThe official, Valentyn Reznychenko, said Russia fired six missiles, three of which were shot down. Railway infrastructure and an industrial enterprise had been destroyed and a services company was burning.\n\n\u201cMass enemy attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. Six missiles!!!\u201d he wrote on the Telegram app.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the governor\u2019s account. The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.\n\nAt a summit in Germany, leaders of the G7 industrialised democracies announced plans for a price cap on Russian oil, designed to starve Russia of the resources for war without exacerbating a global energy crisis.\n\nNext up is a NATO summit in Spain, at which the Western military alliance is expected to announce hundreds of thousands of troops shifting to a higher state of alert and an overhaul of its strategic framework to describe Moscow as an adversary.\n\nAlso bound to infuriate Russia, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that Turkey had agreed to support Finland and Sweden joining NATO.\n\nTurkey\u2019s objections to the membership bids, which if successful would be the biggest shift in European security in decades, had threatened to overshadow a summit striving for unity against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRelatives of the missing in Kremenchuk were lined up at a hotel across the street from the wreckage of the shopping centre, where rescue workers had set up a base. Adults and children, some in tears, lit candles and laid flowers in a tribute to the dead.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians in \u201cone of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said its missiles had struck a nearby arms depot storing Western weapons, which exploded, causing the blaze that spread to the nearby mall.\n\nKyiv said there was no military target in the area.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s goal is for as many Ukrainians as possible to close their eyes forever, for the rest to stop resisting and submit to slavery,\u201d Andriy Yermak, chief of Ukraine\u2019s presidential staff, said on Twitter.\n\nRussia described the shopping centre as disused and empty. But that was contradicted by the relatives of the dead and missing, and the dozens of wounded survivors such as Ludmyla Mykhailets, 43, who had been shopping there with her husband when the blast threw her into the air.\n\n\u201cI flew head first and splinters hit my body. The whole place was collapsing,\u201d she said at a hospital where she was being treated.\n\nG7 leaders said the attack was \u201cabominable\u201d. Russian President Vladimir Putin and those responsible would be held to account, they said in a statement.\n\nRussia denies intentionally targeting civilians in its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that has destroyed Ukrainian cities, killed thousands of people and driven millions from their homes.\n\nUkraine endured another tough day on the battlefields of the eastern Donbas region following last week\u2019s loss of the now-ruined city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian forces are now trying to storm Lysychansk, across the Siverskyi Donets River from Sievierodonetsk, to complete their capture of Luhansk, one of two eastern provinces Moscow aims to conquer on behalf of separatist proxies.\n\nWestern countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia, but so far have failed to curtail Moscow\u2019s main source of income: oil and gas export revenue, which has actually increased as the threat of supply disruption has driven up global prices.\n\nAt the end of its annual summit, the G7 announced a new approach \u2013 leaving Russian oil on the market while imposing a cap on the price countries could pay for it.\n\n\u201cWe invite all like-minded countries to consider joining us in our actions,\u201d they said in a communique.\n\nThe United States also imposed sanctions on more than 100 new targets and banned new imports of Russian gold, acting on commitments made by the G7.\n\nWith summit action now shifting to NATO, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said a new strategic concept would \u201cdescribe in stark terms the threat that Russia poses and the way in which it has shattered peace in Europe\u201d.\n\nThat marks a departure from post-Soviet NATO policy which cast Moscow as a potential partner.\n\nDmitry Rogozin, a former Russian ambassador to NATO and now head of Russia\u2019s space agency, responded by releasing satellite pictures and coordinates of the summit venue, the Pentagon, White House and other Western state buildings.\n\n\u201cToday, the NATO summit opens in Madrid, at which Western countries will declare Russia their worst enemy,\u201d Rogozin wrote on social media. \u201cRoscosmos publishes satellite photographs of the summit venue and the very \u2018decision centres\u2019 that support Ukrainian nationalists.\u201d\n\nThere have been increasing Russian missile strikes a long distance from the frontline over the past few days.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city where Russian troops were pushed back in a counter-offensive in May, authorities said nine people were killed by shelling that hit targets including apartment buildings and a school.",
          "summary": "Firefighters on Tuesday searched the rubble of a Ukrainian shopping mall where authorities said 36 people were missing after a Russian missile strike that killed at least 18, as a regional governor reported another \u201cenemy attack\u201d further east.\nThe attack in the central city of Kremenchuk and the reported strike in the Dnipropetrovsk region were far from any frontlines.\nRussia said it had struck a nearby arms depot and falsely claimed that the mall was empty.\nAlso bound to infuriate Russia, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that Turkey had agreed to support Finland and Sweden joining NATO.\n\u201cToday, the NATO summit opens in Madrid, at which Western countries will declare Russia their worst enemy,\u201d Rogozin wrote on social media.",

          "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell has been sentenced to 20 years in a US prison for helping disgraced former financier Jeffrey Epstein abuse young girls.\n\nMaxwell, 60, was convicted in December of recruiting and trafficking four teenage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein, her then boyfriend.\n\nOne of her accusers said outside the court in New York that she should stay in prison for the rest of her life.\n\nEpstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019.\n\nHe had been awaiting his own sex trafficking trial.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell\u2019s crimes took place over a decade, between 1994 and 2004.\n\nPronouncing sentence, Judge Alison J Nathan said Maxwell\u2019s conduct had been \u201cheinous and predatory\u201d.\n\n\u201cMs Maxwell worked with Epstein to select young victims who were vulnerable and played a pivotal role in facilitating sexual abuse,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said the case called for a \u201cvery significant sentence\u201d and that she wanted to send an \u201cunmistakable message\u201d that such crimes would be punished.\n\nAs well as jail time, the judge imposed a fine of $750,000 (\u00a3610,000).\n\nMaxwell, whose lawyers had argued for a term of less than five years, looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the sentence was passed in front of a packed public gallery.\n\nEarlier, she addressed her victims. She said she empathised with them, adding that she hoped her prison sentence would allow the victims \u201cpeace and finality\u201d.\n\nMaxwell has been in custody since her arrest in July 2020, held mostly at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\nThe case against the British former socialite has been one of the highest-profile since the emergence of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse.\n\nThe judge allowed four women to speak at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, as well as allowing a statement by Virginia Giuffre to be read by her lawyer in her absence.\n\nAnnie Farmer, the only victim on the indictment to give evidence under her full name during the trial, was the first to speak.\n\nShe had to pause midway through her speech in order to contain her emotions but continued to read her statement to the court in full.\n\nSarah Ransome, who did not testify at the trial but was due to give an impact statement, spoke outside court alongside fellow accuser Elizabeth Stein.\n\n\u201cGhislaine must die in prison because I\u2019ve been in Hell and back for the last seventeen years,\u201d Ms Ransome said.\n\n\u201cI was 10 years old when Liz Stein was being trafficked. I was 10. That is how long this sex trafficking ring has been going on for. And it should have just taken one survivor to come forward for us to be taken seriously. It should not have been this hard.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, Ms Farmer and three other women, identified in court only by their first names or pseudonyms to protect their privacy, testified that they had been abused as minors at Epstein\u2019s homes in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nThey recounted how Maxwell had talked them into giving Epstein massages which turned sexual, luring them with gifts and promises about how Epstein could use his money and connections to help them.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s lawyers have tried to portray their client as a positive influence on other inmates in jail, offering to teach them yoga and help them learn English.\n\nThe crimes of Epstein, who mixed with some of the world\u2019s most famous people, were first reported in the media in 2005 and he served prison time in Florida in 2008-09 on a state charge of procuring a minor for prostitution.\n\nFollowing numerous lawsuits, he was arrested again in 2019 in a federal case in New York.\n\nAt least eight women wrote letters to the judge describing how they had suffered.\n\nVictims speak of their pain\n\nIn her written victim impact statement, Ms Farmer said: \u201cFor a long time, I wanted to erase from my mind the crimes that Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein committed against me and pretend they hadn\u2019t happened.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t talk about it for years. It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to keep locked away, and so I did the best I could. The world did not cooperate with this strategy, however.\n\n\u201cSomething would bring to mind this experience and my body would respond with an upset stomach and physical shakiness. I\u2019d feel irritable, have trouble focusing, and feel disoriented\u2026\n\n\u201cOne of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts.\u201d\n\nVirginia Giuffre wrote: \u201cGhislaine, 22 years ago, in the summer of 2000, you spotted me at the Mar-a-Lago Hotel in Florida, and you made a choice. You chose to follow me and procure me for Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\u201cTogether, you damaged me physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally\u2026.Without question, Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible paedophile. But I never would have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so many others, you opened the door to hell\u201d.\n\nA woman referred to in court as \u201cKate\u201d wrote in her statement: \u201cThe consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far reaching for me.\n\n\u201cI have struggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic attacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered low self esteem, loss of career opportunities. I have battled greatly with feeling unable to trust my own instincts in choosing romantic relationships.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to me at that young age changed the course of my life drastically forever.\u201d\n\nAnother accuser, Juliette Bryant, wrote that she had never felt okay since the day Maxwell and Epstein \u201cgot their hands\u201d on her.\n\n\u201cThinking about them still gives me frequent panic attacks and night terrors,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the victims, including myself, are eternally grateful for everyone that has helped expose these criminals.\u201d\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Lewis Hamilton has condemned three-time Formula One world champion Nelson Piquet for using a racially abusive term about him in an interview.\n\nThe 69-year-old Brazilian used the derogatory term in a podcast in Portuguese following last year\u2019s British Grand Prix, when title rivals Hamilton and Max Verstappen collided on the first lap at Silverstone. The podcast came to light this week.\n\nPiquet, who is the father of Verstappen\u2019s girlfriend, Kelly, used a racist term about Hamilton while accusing him of mishandling his car into the first corner. Piquet added Hamilton was \u201clucky\u201d to continue in the race.\n\nThe seven-time world champion said on Twitter on Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s more than language. These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I\u2019ve been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life.\n\n\u201cThere has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action.\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted in Portuguese: \u201cLet\u2019s focus on changing the mindset.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, F1 also condemned the term used by Piquet in a statement that read: \u201cDiscriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect.\n\n\u201cHis tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Hamilton\u2019s team, Mercedes, issued a statement: \u201cWe condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind. Lewis has spearheaded our sport\u2019s efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track.\n\n\u201cTogether, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future.\u201d\n\nFormula One returns to Silverstone this weekend.",
