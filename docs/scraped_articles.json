          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr. Lateef Akinola, has urged pregnant women to avoid acute starvation, noting that it puts them at risk of severe vomiting, placenta dysfunctions, and respiratory distress.\n\nAccording to him, acute starvation in pregnancy could also lead to poor pregnancy outcomes.\n\nDr. Akinola stated further that women experiencing acute starvation in pregnancy might also experience foetal growth restrictions, stillbirths, and increased newborn foetal morbidity/mortality, adding that they are also more prone to maternal preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH Healthwise, Dr. Akinola said the effect of acute starvation in pregnancy was worse in the third trimester.\n\nAkinola who is the Medical Director of Medison Specialist Women\u2019s Hospital, Lagos, said, \u201cAcute starvation in pregnancy can cause severe metabolic dysfunction notably starvation ketoacidosis, and infrequently causes severe metabolic acidosis and placental dysfunctions, which can precipitate insulin resistance, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia.\n\n\u201cThis in turn increases susceptibility to ketosis, particularly in the third trimester that can be complicated by foetal growth restrictions and stillbirths.\n\n\u201cFor instance, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and abnormal reproductive functions in adulthood might be predicated on inadequate nutrition during pregnancy. Acute starvation in pregnancy is usually precipitated by severe hyperemesis gravidarum (severe vomiting during pregnancy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, more than 400,000 babies are born dead in Nigeria annually. Out of more than 2.5 million babies that are born dead globally each year, more than 400,000 stillborn deaths take place in Nigeria, the agency says.\n\nNigeria is one of the five countries in the world with the highest number of under-five deaths, says UNICEF.\n\nDr. Akinola, an IVF specialist, stressed that early diagnosis and management of this condition are necessary to prevent maternal and foetal complications.\n\n\u201cSymptoms to watch out for include severe vomiting especially late in pregnancy. Respiratory distress and significant acid-base disturbances can occur. Other notable causes to watch out for aside from hyperemesis include diabetic ketoacidosis and alcohol-induced acidosis.\n\n\u201cManagement should be promptly instituted, intravenous rehydration, glucose infusion, and nutrient substitution are essential to prevent circulatory hypovolemia.\n\n\u201cThis should also be aimed to correct ketoacidosis and metabolic acidosis. Hospital admission is necessary where daily monitoring of vital signs, urinalysis, serum electrolyte, and urea and/or liver functions, adding that diligent foetal monitoring is essential to preventing maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality.\n\n\u201cSometimes, early delivery in the presence of an experienced neonatologist is essential to prevent foetal complications including stillbirth,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics in its Poverty and Inequality report 2019, one in 10 or more than 82.9 million Nigerians live in poverty.\n\nAlso, the World Bank says 96 million Nigerians will be living in poverty by 2022.\n\nPoverty, experts say, is a key hindrance to women\u2019s wellbeing, especially during pregnancy resulting in malnutrition, anaemia, low birth babies, or foetal loss.\n\nThe maternal expert noted that foetal nutrition in utero keeps going on until a certain stage that could now be detrimental when starvation is prolonged for too long.\n\n\u201cThis could result in intrauterine growth restrictions and eventually if not attended to intrauterine foetal death,\u201c he said.\n\nIt is well established that an adequate and balanced diet during pregnancy is essential for the health of mothers and babies, both in the womb and when born,\u201d the gynecologist said.\n\nHe noted that it is important to detect this problem during pregnancy so that appropriate care can be given.\n\n\u201cA growth-restricted foetus may need expert care to survive. They come out quite hungry, \u201d he added.\n\nHe pointed out that a pregnant woman is supposed to feed well and have an appropriate diet at all times for optimal development of the foetus.\n\nHighlighting the dangers of poor nutrition in pregnancy, Dr. Akinola said poor nutrition will cause inadequate development of the baby because nutrients are required for cells of the foetus to develop properly.\n\n\u201cNutrients such as iron are very important in the development of the cells.\n\n\u201cWhen a pregnant woman stops taking foods rich in iron, she will be deficient in iron and that deficiency will affect the foetus and the cells will not form properly and this will lead to malformation when the baby is born,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "An Abuja-based human rights lawyer, Maduabuchi Idam, has narrated how men of the Nigeria Police Force manhandled him while visiting his clients detained unlawfully.\n\nIdam said police officers attached to the Effab Metropolis Police Outpost, opposite National Open University, NOUN, in Dutse, Dawaki area of Abuja, prevented him from leaving the station after visiting his clients who were detained.\n\nHe said his clients, two Nigerians and two Chinese, were arrested for dealing in donkey meat and skin by policemen from the outpost.\n\nThe suspects Nuhu, Abdul, Shen, and Zou were arrested and incarcerated for 14 days without trial.\n\nIdam argued that the matter over the legality of trading in donkey meat and skin was still in court.\n\nNarrating his ordeal, Idam, on June 30, 2022, said he visited the police outpost to request administrative bail for his clients.\n\nUpon sighting him, Idam said the Investigation Police Officer, IPO, in charge of the case Mohammad, charged at him for trying to release those allegedly involved in an illegal business.\n\nIdam said Mohammad ordered other policemen to lock the post\u2019s gate upon his entrance while vowing to detain him till the next day.\n\nSpeaking with DAILY POST, the activist lawyer said: \u201cFollowing my clients Mararaban Idah Donkey Meat and Skin Dealers Association instructions, I visited the said police Outpost around 1:30 pm on June 30, 2022, to request for administrative bail of four of my clients (two Nigerians and two Chinese Nationals) who have been incarcerated for over 14 days without trial on the alleged offences of trading on donkey skins.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe two Nigerians Nuhu and Abdul, were arrested in far away Mararaban Idah, Kaduna State, and brought to the Police Outpost in Dawaki, Abuja. Whereas, the two Chinese nationals were arrested in their home in Jabi, Abuja FCT, on the mere suspicion that they were donkey skin dealers. An allegation which they have long denied.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the two Chinese nationals (Shen and Zou) were some time in January 2022 arrested and detained for about a month in Central Police Station Abuja and later released without trial, after a series of inhuman and degrading treatment.\n\n\u201cThe Investigating Police Officer directed me to wait for his \u2018Oga\u2019 one DSP Adebayo; I told him I preferred to use the opportunity to quickly attend a very brief meeting before he gets to the station since I don\u2019t know how long it will take him to be in the station. Meanwhile, he reluctantly obliged to give me a call once the Oga arrived at the station.\n\n\u201cJust within a few minutes, I left the station; I was alerted that the \u2018Oga\u2019 had been informed of my visit, and he had directed that I should come back and wait for him. I quickly returned to the station as directed.\n\n\u201cTo my chagrin, the very moment I stepped into the station from the gate, the said IPO, Mohammad Balarabe, retorted at me from the entrance of the police station where he was standing in a very embarrassing manner \u201d who are those sending you to come and demand for the bail of people who are into illegal business\u201d \u201ctoday you must give us a statement on the whereabouts of those who sent you to this station\u201d \u201cWe need to arrest all of them and their partners\u201d \u201d officer take him inside let him give you a statement under caution, thereafter he will look for someone to bail him, he will not leave this place today, he must sleep here today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was lost in the middle of those statements and directives. In my confused state, I feigned ignorance of the fact that I was the one being referred to, not until the officer he had given instructions attempted to grab me. At this point, it was clear to me that I was in for yet another police bruhaha despite my very unprovoked approach. Hence, I quickly reminded the policeman that I am a lawyer duly called to the Nigerian Bar and have not become a suspect for coming to offer my professional service to my clients.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the IPO quickly instructed other officers in the station to block the gate against me in other to prevent me from exiting or escaping, as he insisted that I must spend a night in the station that day. The gates were manned by the officers as directed.\n\n\u201cWith shaky and jittery hands, I managed to compose a distress Whatsapp message to my partner, Benson Aigbojie, and to the Human Right Committee NBA Bwari Branch, where I am a member; soliciting for rescue.\u201d\n\nIdam said members of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, stormed the police outpost following his distress message.\n\nDAILY POST learnt that the head of the police outpost, DSP Adebayo Jogojogo, ordered that Idam should be detained because he wrote a petition against him and his men.\n\n\u201cThankfully, the rescue team comprising of about 20 lawyers, including the NBA chairman Bwari Branch, his Vice Chairman and others, quickly intervened around 7 pm to the Police Outpost for my rescue.\n\n\u201cShortly after their arrival, the said \u2018Oga\u2019 surfaced from nowhere apparently, he was the person that sanctioned my ordeal and his reason for this, was that we (my self and Aigbojie) had authored a petition against him and others for which he is currently undergoing investigation for.\n\n\u201cI was eventually released around 8:12 pm, following the timely intervention of the Chairman, NBA, Bwari Branch,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen DAILY POST reached out to the head of the police outpost, Jogojogo, threatened to arrest Idam.\n\nJogojogo told our correspondent that Idam had failed to return suspects whom he secured an administrative bail.\n\nHe vowed to arrest Idam and work towards the revocation of his licence.\n\nAccording to Jogojogo: \u201cI don\u2019t know him as a lawyer because he has never shown any identity card as a lawyer. Wearing a gown or wig does not make you a lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe always comes to the Outpost and requests for bail of suspects arrested for trading and killing donkeys which is prohibited by the law.\n\n\u201cHe is my suspect; he usually comes and releases all our suspects and doesn\u2019t bring them back. He came for another suspect and I told my men to detain him, and he called all the lawyers in Abuja who begged me to allow him to leave so he would come the second day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for him; if he is with you, I will come over and arrest him.\n\n\u201cHe is a Nigerian citizen; I can arrest him. I worked in Supreme Court before I left; I was the Second-In-Command to the DPO, I was the DCO 1, and all the Supreme Court judges know me.\n\n\u201cI have prerequisite knowledge of common and Sharia law because I read law. He knows nothing, which is why he runs up and down. He should come and challenge me physically, I have told him to take me to court, but he can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI want to arrest him, after which I will write to NBA and the Supreme Court to seize his certificate; that\u2019s why he is running up and down.\u201d",

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), on Wednesday, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to resign or be impeached over his alleged perennial failure to take decisive action on terrorists.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, also said the Buhari government and the military are fine with the spate of terrorist attacks in the country as they have failed to deploy the 12 Super Tucano fighter jets against terrorists turning the country into another Afghanistan.\n\nRecall that terrorists on Tuesday attacked the advanced security convoy of Buhari near Dutsinma, Katsina State, reportedly killing two policemen in the process. The officials were travelling to Daura ahead of the trip of the President to his hometown for Sallah.\n\nTerrorists also attacked the Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje in the Federal Capital Territory on Tuesday, allegedly freeing inmates and killing security agents.\n\nRecently, a community leader in the Birnin Gwari Emirate of Kaduna State Zubairu Abdulra\u2019uf revealed that farmers in the area paid about N400 million to bandits in order to be allowed to carry on with their farming activities.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s Onwubiko said, \u201cThese major incidents are too heavy to be ignored. Terrorists are becoming daring because the government is in bed with armed Fulani terrorists.\n\n\u201cThese bandits were designated as terrorists by a Federal High Court in November 2021 but eight months after, the government has not taken any definitive military actions to stamp them out.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the 12 Super Tucano fighter jets bought from the United States have not been deployed against the terrorists in the North-West despite that the court judgement ordered the government to do so.\n\n\u201cThe failure and inaction of the government have buoyed the heinous and condemnable crimes of the terrorists who now make a fortune from the odious venture of kidnapping Nigerians and have gone as far as collecting taxes like in Kaduna where farmers have so far paid N400 million in protection tax to Fulani terrorists.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, attacks on prisons have grown so much under Buhari. There have been about 15 jailbreaks in the last five years under Buhari and over 3,400 inmates have fled.\n\n\u201cBuhari has failed Nigerians and himself. This is the time for either Buhari to resign or he be impeached if the National Assembly members can grow ball. They must do it or else Nigeria is doomed and over 200 million refugees will flow out of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhy is the minister of interior still on seat? \u201c",

We have been talking with applicants\u2019 counsel since the day of judgement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difficulty you are facing in complying with that order,\u201d the judge asked.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty is that we want to protect the system. If we comply with this judgment, the system will suffer in the future my lord,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed said although NIMC had reached 90 per cent compliance with the order, the commission was constraint to release the biodata to the applicants because of the Act which set up the agency.\n\nHe said the law does not allow the commission to release an individual biodata to another individual.\n\nThe lawyer stressed that if this was done because the applicants were highly-placed persons, this might be abused in future.\n\nThe judge, however, said that the order was not made because the applicants were high-placed.\n\nHe said the judgment was made for the whole of the country, saying it could have been an ordinary Nigerian making the application and that the court is there to protect everyone.\n\n\u201cIf you need an order of court to carry out the judgment, it is a simple application,\u201d Ekwo added.\n\nMohammed, therefore, made an omnibus prayer, urging the court to direct the agency to supply the biodata information of Ukpo to the AGF.\n\nAwomolo did not oppose the application.\n\n\u201cWe agree that the document be transmitted to the AGF for onward transmission to the UK,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Ekwo ordered NIMC to supply the information of biodata of David Ukpo\u2019s national identification number which is in its care to the AGF for onward transmission to the UK.\n\n\u201cThis is the order of this court,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge also warned the lawyer against making use of social media to discuss court matters\n\n\u201cWhen matter is in court, you must be careful how you deploy social media about court matters,\u201d he warned.\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Community Residents In South-East Nigeria, Others Desert Homes Over Rise In Ritual Killings",
          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich. It is sad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSpokespersons for the police in Abia and Anambra states, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Ikenga Tochukwu, when contacted by SaharaReporters on Thursday, said that the cases will be looked into and appropriate measures would be taken to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives called for the declaration of a national emergency of the rising cases of ritual killings across Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Mr Toby Okechukwu, moved the motion during plenary at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHe and his colleagues urged the National Orientation Agency and other stakeholders in the society to embark on vigorous campaigns to open the eyes of members of the public especially youths to the evils of ritual killings for money.\n\n\n\nBut according to a Lagos-based sociologist, Nike Adetutu, tackling this dangerous trend in Nigeria will also require the return to core morals and values in society.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, training and monitoring at the family level has broken down and that is why there are young people with misplaced priorities and poor orientation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"We must go back to the family system, where everything starts, we have failed in that area as a society.\n\n\n\n\"Parents are no longer giving the right training and monitoring to their children and that is why many of them have gone astray.\n\n\n\n\"The return to core morals and values will save us from all these problems. If we don't act fast, we may not be able to handle the disaster already looming,\" she said.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Community Residents In South-East Nigeria, Others Desert Homes Over Rise In Ritual Killings",
          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich. It is sad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSpokespersons for the police in Abia and Anambra states, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Ikenga Tochukwu, when contacted by SaharaReporters on Thursday, said that the cases will be looked into and appropriate measures would be taken to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives called for the declaration of a national emergency of the rising cases of ritual killings across Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Mr Toby Okechukwu, moved the motion during plenary at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHe and his colleagues urged the National Orientation Agency and other stakeholders in the society to embark on vigorous campaigns to open the eyes of members of the public especially youths to the evils of ritual killings for money.\n\n\n\nBut according to a Lagos-based sociologist, Nike Adetutu, tackling this dangerous trend in Nigeria will also require the return to core morals and values in society.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, training and monitoring at the family level has broken down and that is why there are young people with misplaced priorities and poor orientation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"We must go back to the family system, where everything starts, we have failed in that area as a society.\n\n\n\n\"Parents are no longer giving the right training and monitoring to their children and that is why many of them have gone astray.\n\n\n\n\"The return to core morals and values will save us from all these problems. If we don't act fast, we may not be able to handle the disaster already looming,\" she said.",

          "text": "Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), says he would remove the costly petrol subsidy if there is an alternative.\n\nObi said this on Wednesday during a live interview on Arise TV.\n\nThe presidential candidate said petrol subsidy is not beneficial to the country\u2019s economy, describing it as a scam.\n\nTheCable had reported that petrol subsidy payments gulped N1.27 trillion in the last five months \u2014 about 31 percent of the N4 trillion provision for the year. It eroded oil gains as Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited failed to remit revenue to the federation account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have spent over $40 billion on subsidy. Our total education expenditure in the past 10 years is about N8 trillion (about $20 billion on $400/$1). This is 50 percent of it,\u201d Obi said.\n\n\u201cIf we spent $20 billion in power, we would have been generating and distributing 20,000 megawatts of electricity today.\n\n\u201cIt means subsidy alone would have solved a lot of issues in our education, health and in power. If we have 20,000mw, we will be growing at more than 4 percent and add over $100 billion to our GDP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWithin the same period, we\u2019ve borrowed $90 billion, which we\u2019re servicing. With this, you could see total mismanagement of resources that could have changed the entire north\u2026 that vast land would have been huge farmland.\u201d\n\nOn whether or not to remove subsidy, Obi said, \u201cWe have to study and look at it critically.

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "10 lessons Emeka Ajene learned while building Gozem",
          "text": "This insightful op-ed was contributed to TechCabal by Emeka Ajene. Emeka Ajene co-founded Gozem alongside Raphael Dana in 2018.\n\nAmong the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria, there\u2019s a proverb that says: \u201cWhat was secret is revealed in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThanks to a variety of experiences across African markets over the last decade, I\u2019ve become privy to a number of earned insights regarding innovation-led businesses across the continent.\n\nBuilding a super app for Francophone Africa\n\nIn 2018, I moved to Lom\u00e9, Togo to bring my various experiences to bear in service of a singular opportunity: building a super app for Africa, starting in Francophone Africa.\n\nAfter four years of advancing this vision alongside an exceptional team, I am pleased to share that I have transitioned from day-to-day management & operational role to a strategic advisor role at Gozem.\n\nFrom the earliest days of traversing the streets of Lom\u00e9 in search of informal sector motorcycle taxi drivers amenable to a quick sales pitch, to our series A fundraise and our recently announced partnership with the International Finance Corporation, to bringing to market what\u2019s now truly Africa\u2019s super app \u2013 one which operates a variety of verticals across Togo, Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon, generates multi-million USD GMV, employs hundreds of team members across West & Central Africa, and positively affects the lives of many thousands of drivers, vendors, & other partners on a daily basis \u2014 the journey has certainly been personally and professionally fulfilling.\n\nSo rather than recount past successes or detail the varied contributions of Raph, Greg, Jean-Martial, Gr\u00e2ce, C\u00e9cilia, Lionel, Manfreed, Pierrick, and many others over the years, here are some useful lessons, peppered with Igbo proverbs, I learned along the way.\n\n\u201cProverbs are the oil with which words are eaten.\u201d \u2013 Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart (1994)\n\nGozem Team. Image source: Emeka Ajene\n\n1. Culture is a function of leadership\n\n\u201cWhen the mother goat chews her cud, her child watches her mouth.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOrganizational culture is a funny thing. Everyone generally agrees upon its importance, at least in theory \u2014 \u2018culture eats strategy for breakfast\u2019 and so on \u2014 but in practice, at the earliest stages of company building, there are many other pressing (and more tangible) issues that steal attention.\n\nAcross African markets where the innovation economy is still nascent and some positive aspects of Silicon Valley-style management aren\u2019t widely-adopted (yet?); it is easy for startups to fall into locally familiar paternalistic, hierarchy-driven cultures where most \u2013 or all \u2013 decision-making comes from authority.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s not uncommon to find that managers are put (or put themselves) on an unwarranted pedestal. (See, for example, the recent conversation around hostile work cultures across the Nigerian tech ecosystem spurred by Damilare\u2019s expos\u00e9 in TechCabal.)\n\nBut often, the highest and best use of authority by company leaders isn\u2019t to simply show power, but to create and empower internal leaders.\n\n2. Talent development is a differentiator\n\n\u201cKnowing but not telling is what kills old men. Hearing but not heeding is what kills young men.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAttracting talent is a challenge for all organizations, and doubly so for early-stage companies. Newer organizations often lack the prestige, ability to pay, and perception of job security (/\u2018deriskification\u2019) that more established businesses enjoy. And for startups operating in African markets, the talent challenge is compounded by the relative lack of depth within local talent pools.\n\nStartups across the African continent must intentionally and aggressively build their talent development muscle. There needs to be a real answer to this question: \u201cHow do we rapidly upskill junior staff and systematically prepare them to grow in the company and take on new challenges?\u201d\n\nOne specific and unorthodox initiative that we undertook at Gozem was to identify promising drivers on the platform and offer them salaried roles within our operational teams. While in some sense this may be cannibalistic as it often takes the best drivers off the roads, these driver ambassadors have a unique understanding of the Gozem platform and are often able to speak and lead certain driver-facing functions in more credible ways.\n\n3. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it, and it\u2019s what gets understood\n\n\u201cThe voice that\u2019s used in quarreling is not the same voice that\u2019s used in making peace.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOftentimes, when I disclose that I moved to Togo to launch Gozem despite not speaking any French, people are shocked. But it\u2019s true, and the experience taught me valuable lessons about communicating effectively.\n\nThere is great difficulty involved in leading a team of people who speak a different language\u2013 a humbling experience to say the least. For me, among other things, it served as a forcing function for trust & deferential leadership \u2013 letting junior team members make contributions in important discussions with external counterparties.\n\nIn Gozem\u2019s early days, after a few miscommunication-linked mishaps, I began sending a daily morning narrative email in French (translated via DeepL) that highlighted priorities of the day and key recent wins & opportunities for improvement.\n\nWhile oral communication certainly has its place, well-thought-out written business communication can improve comprehension, eliminate misunderstandings, and provide organization-wide clarity \u2013 it\u2019s one reason to take Amazon\u2019s business writing culture seriously.\n\nParaphrasing Jeff Bezos, \u201c[written communication] forces better thought and better understanding of what\u2019s more important than what, and how things are related.\u201c\n\n4. When you have leverage, use it\n\n\u201cIf a snake fails to show its venom, children will use it to tie firewood.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nLeverage is a dynamic thing. You have it at one moment under certain conditions, but the next moment, conditions change and you lose it.\n\nIn negotiations, potential \u2018adversaries\u2019 \u2014 employers/employees, founders/investors, business partners, etc \u2014 are often driven primarily by self-interest, so the ability to recognize where the leverage lies at a given point in time can be very valuable.\n\nTo win, one must develop a long-term and non-zero-sum viewpoint. Nonetheless, it\u2019s advisable to exploit identified leverage. While there\u2019ll likely be future consequences if a hand is overplayed, more often than not, unused leverage becomes a source of regret.\n\n5. Systems lead to success\n\n\u201cWhen a group of people expects things to be done by others, nothing is done.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBest-selling author James Clear wrote, \u201cWe don\u2019t rise to the level of our goals; we fall to the level of our systems.\u201d By this, he means that achieving successful outcomes requires consistent faithfulness to enabling processes. And while his book primarily focuses on individuals, I find the same is true for organizations.\n\nIt\u2019s why many of the world\u2019s leading innovation-led organizations use operating/management systems \u2014 the most popular tend to be EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), Scaling Up, and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)\n\nAt Gozem (thanks largely to the influence of Kevin Colas), we began implementing the Scaling Up method two and a half years or so into our journey. Since then, we\u2019ve seen significant gains in terms of accountability, clarity of expectations, and cross-functional visibility.\n\n6. Become a big fish by dominating smaller ponds\n\n\u201cDrop by drop is how the palm wine fills the container.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\n\u201cWould you rather be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?\u201d\n\nFor businesses with venture-scale ambitions, markets matter. So the only answer is to play in a big pond \u2014 one with a clear path to becoming a big fish.\n\nAt Gozem, while we\u2019ve always maintained a big fish-big pond vision since day one, our initial geographic market was Togo, a country with a population of just 8 million, and our initial focus was on the ride-hailing vertical. It\u2019s no surprise that many viewed us quizzically, with many questions about the strategy of playing small initially.\n\nA relevant French expression that I learned during my time in Togo is \u2018Petit \u00e0 petit, l\u2019oiseau fait son nid\u2018 \u2014 little by little the bird builds its nest.\n\n7. Embrace constraints & learn quickly\n\n\u201cHot soup should be sipped carefully.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAccording to Howard Stevenson, an entrepreneurship professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, \u201centrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled.\u201d And, as alluded to in point 6 above, at the early stages of new ventures, it seems there are never enough resources: not enough time, not enough talent, not enough capital, and so on.\n\nConstraints often inspire better thinking, compel creativity, and force focus and (ruthless) prioritization. In many cases, this leads to quick iteration and rapid learning of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and what truly moves the needle. And when a winning formula is found, constraints push you to fully exploit the opportunity and develop a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n\nRead: Marissa Mayer\u2019s \u201cCreativity loves constraints,\u201d \u2014 a book she penned while at Google.\n\n\u201cit is often easier to direct your energy when you start with constrained challenges\u2026or constrained possibilities. \u2026 Limited investment makes it easier to move on to something else that has a better chance of success.\u201d \u2013 Marissa Mayer.\n\n8. Resilience should be a core organizational trait\n\n\u201cA palm nut that wants to become palm oil must pass through fire.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAll businesses have to be resilient of course, but when comparing my experiences in the West to those across sub-Saharan Africa, I\u2019d say that resilience \u2014 the ability to recover quickly from sudden disturbances and adapt easily to misfortune \u2014 is much more necessary in African markets where extraneous shocks are much more common.\n\nDuring my time in Togo, Gozem experienced its share of unforeseen external bad luck, from office flooding to power outages to regular connectivity disruptions and more. Still, the exercise of planning is essential and robust processes to respond to the unplanned are recommended.\n\nWhile I love the Mike Tyson quote, \u201ceveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,\u201d getting punched in the mouth is far from uncommon in a boxing match and one should certainly be prepared to respond.\n\n9. Character, reputation, and integrity are everything\n\n\u201cNot everyone who answers to the title Chief is a legitimate chief.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOne of the most famous scenes in the critically acclaimed TV series The Wire involves ruthless crime lord Marlo Stanfield (played by Jaime Hector) exclaiming, \u201cMy name is my name!\u201d\n\nFor founders and managers of young ventures, your name is your name. Said simply, reputation matters.\n\nAs much as we\u2019d all like the freedom to be individuals, startup leaders (and business leaders in general) represent more than themselves; they represent employees, investors, and other significant stakeholders. How they\u2019re perceived among different groups \u2014 potential customers, partners, investors, etc. \u2014 can often have a real business impact, like it or not. Call it the penalty of leadership in today\u2019s connected age: \u201c[Leaders] must perpetually live in the white light of publicity.\u201d\n\nAnd in low-trust environments such as African markets, my view is that this is doubly important. Both on the individual and institutional levels, it\u2019s important to always act with integrity, deliver on promises, and avoid doubt-inducing controversies.\n\n10. As you build a business, the business builds you\n\n\u201cThe right hand washes the left hand, the left hand washes the right hand.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBuilding a business is a process of discovery. You discover who your customers are and what they need and will pay for. You discover the products and services that best meet those needs. And you discover how to sustainably and profitably meet those needs.\n\nSo there\u2019s customer and market discovery, product discovery, and business model discovery, but one thing not talked about enough is self-discovery \u2014 throughout the entire process one learns and discovers things about her/himself.\n\nIn early-stage ventures, founders and early employees, at the least, tend to be unusually invested in a company\u2019s ups and downs, its peaks and valleys, its daily mishaps and milestones, and they learn things \u2014 about markets, management, and more \u2014 that ultimately shape their worldview. The intensity of the experience often brings with it earned insights that can last well beyond the lifetime of one\u2019s involvement with the business.\n\nHere, I\u2019m reminded of two quotes that I\u2019ll let speak for themselves.\n\nThe American Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, \u201cThe mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\u201d\n\nAnd Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with the quote, \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\u2019s not the same river and he\u2019s not the same man.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Need for CBN Intervention in ASUU Strike \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nNigerian educational system needs financial intervention including the ASUU strike. There is need for Central Bank of Nigeria intervention in ASUU strike. CBN has the financial capacity to intervene on the present ASUU\u2019s strike which has been a recurrence decimal in the Academic calendar of Nigerian students. The strike actions, mostly blamed on the government\u2019s non-implementation of agreement with the academic body, have disrupted the academic pursuits of most Nigerian students with an estimated 75 per cent graduating later than scheduled. In 2013, Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, declared a strike on December 17, 2013, which lasted 6 months over non-implementation of 2009 agreement between the union and the Federal Government. It was eventually called off after the federal government agreed to some demands of the Academic body.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has disclosed that it introduced no less than 37 intervention programmes to boost the economy of the country. There is need for CBN to include ASUU on its intervention list so that our children can go back to their various universities. It is therefore not surprising if the bank can also step in to salvage the nation\u2019s languishing education sector knowing that education is central to any development efforts.\n\nNigeria\u2019s budget for the education sector has averaged around 5.3 per cent of the budget which is in sharp contrast to the recommended target and continues to drop. From a GDP perspective, the figure paints an even more dismal picture, as the education sector accounted for 1.94 per cent of the real GDP in Q1 2021 and 1.86 per cent in 2020.\n\nAccording to data from UNESCO, about 76,338 Nigerians were studying abroad as of 2018, which is the highest recorded by an African country. From all indications, Nigeria\u2019s persistent level of underinvestment compared to global standards does not bode well for any effort towards improving the nation\u2019s human capital index, nor will it address the seemingly insatiable demands for foreign education.\n\nThe Nigerian education sector requires adequate funding as well as the willingness to build competitive value amongst its peers. CBN can intervene in ASUU strike at this critical crisis. It was perhaps in a bid to replicate the magic wand which has worked so well in transforming the Nigerian agricultural sector in the area of education, that the CBN under Emefiele delved into the education sector with different initiatives which if well implemented will place the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions among the top 100 tertiary institutions in the world.\n\nAmong these initiatives are the N63 billion Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Centres of Excellence in nine Federal Government owned universities across the country to enhance post-graduate studies in financial related courses and the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) to train and finance entrepreneurship ideas of Nigerian university graduates.\n\nInaugurating one of the centres of excellence at Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria recently, the CBN Governor, Emefiele said that the project was part of the apex bank\u2019s intervention in education.\n\nHe explained that the centres would be delivered in phases and the first phase, which comprised the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria had been completed and ready for use by the institutions.\n\nThe Director Corporate Communications Department, CBN, Mr Osita Nwanisobi has stated that currently, the bank has about 37 purpose-driven interventions that are functionally based, well-thought-out and born out of the critical issues within the economic space.\n\n\u201cWe know the issues of insurgency, insecurity, exchange pass through, issues of price adjustment in terms of power or fuel and others. All of these are parked together is what we are seeing as inflation today. That is also why CBN is doing massive intervention especially in agriculture,\u201d he said. Mr Nwanisobi who said that CBN is diversifying the economy to non-oil sectors to boost the economy of the country disclosed that CBN is intervening massively in agriculture to reduce inflation and create more jobs for our youths.\n\nIt goes without saying that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under the leadership of Mr. Godwin Emefiele as governor, has impacted Nigeria\u2019s developmental strides more than any other in recent history of the bank. The apex bank\u2019s intervention programmes in various sectors of the economy including the creation of a N100 billion targeted credit facility; N100 billion health sector intervention facility, Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI), N1 trillion for the manufacturing sector and of course its legendary exploits in the agricultural sector through the Anchor Borrowers Programme, have all gone to show the commitment of the bank to the development of the country beyond monetary policy regulation.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, human capital development is integral to any country\u2019s sustainable development and poverty reduction goals. Critically, education and knowledge capacity building are critical drivers of human capital development.\n\nThus, investment in education is one of the bedrocks of society and helps determine the level of development recorded in an economy.\n\nThe value of education in an economy cannot be overemphasized, as it helps shape both individuals and the broader society, and forms a huge source of economic value.\n\nOver the years, Nigeria\u2019s education sector has suffered neglect of the worst order. In fact a review of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) data suggests Nigeria\u2019s educational sector has suffered massive capital flight in the last 10 years.\n\nSpecifically, using the CBN\u2019s balance of payment statistics, Nigerians have spent a hefty sum of $28.65 billion on foreign education between 2010 and 2020.\n\nNeedless to say that the high demand for dollars to pay these foreign educational institutions has affected the country\u2019s foreign reserve (which currently stands at $33.39 billion), and contributed immensely to piling pressure on the exchange rate.\n\n_______________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes via inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

Gbemisola Saraki, Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development (formerly Minister of State, Transportation).\n\nPresident Buhari urged the newest members of his cabinet to consult and collaborate with older cabinet colleagues and focus on driving key programmes already initiated by this administration.\n\nHe also charged them to serve the nation diligently, maintain unalloyed loyalty to the country and office of the President.\n\nHe said the new redeployment is aimed at reinvigorating certain sectors where the government desires to accomplish improved results.\n\nSpeaking at the swearing-in ceremony, which preceded the virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, the President said as his administration is now on the home-stretch of its second term, more work still needs to be done in diverse areas of the economy and national life.\n\nHe also warned all members of the cabinet against corrupt practices, reiterating that public officers must be above board and those caught in corrupt practices would face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u2018\u2018I begin this address by welcoming on board, all newly sworn-in members of the Federal Executive Council. I also congratulate you because the process that you all passed through to reach this stage has been rigorous and meticulous.\n\n\u2018\u2018The appointment of these new Ministers is in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which prescribes that the Federal Executive Council shall be made up of members from every state of the Federation.\n\n\u2018\u2018I therefore urge you to consider your emergence out of millions of equally qualified Nigerians within the purview of selection from your State, as a call to duty which imposes the obligation to serve the nation diligently and presents to you the unique opportunity to work hard in service to the Government and the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018At the valedictory session for six former Ministers that departed to pursue other political careers, I promised that their replacement shall be a matter of priority so that the business of governance would not experience delays or setbacks.\n\n\u2018\u2018This administration has been in the saddle since 2015 and is now on the home-stretch of its second term, as the nation prepares for the 2023 general elections. All through, it has vigorously pursued the three main electoral objectives namely: Securing the nation; Diversifying & growing the economy as well as fighting corruption.\n\n\u2018\u2018You are all coming on-board at this time with new energy, ideas, experiences and vigour, to join the existing team so that the implementation of policies, programs and projects associated with these electoral objectives would be escalated and accelerated.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is still so much to be done for our country in the areas of infrastructure development, energy, access to finance, access to justice, technology and innovation, trade, agriculture, education and security. The list is inexhaustible,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the newly appointed ministers to be conscious that time is of the essence as they assume office.\n\n\u2018\u2018As I assign you portfolios, therefore, I expect you to carefully study your sectors, take wise counsel, reach out to key stakeholders, consult and collaborate with older cabinet colleagues and focus on driving key programs already initiated by this administration. Above all, be loyal to your President and your country.\u2019\u2019\n\nUnderscoring the need for the old and new members of his Cabinet to work with common objectives of leaving indelible legacies for Nigerians and ending strongly with verifiable accomplishments, the President warned:\n\n\u2018\u2018You must resist bad counsel, resist temptation and be circumspect in your utterances and conduct. You must totally eschew corruption and be above board because if caught there will be no sacred cows,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told the newly appointed ministers to await further communication on their appropriate Ministerial Mandates from the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the FEC meeting and swearing-in ceremony, the Council observed a minute of silence in honour of the Secretary-General of Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammed Barkindo, who died on Tuesday in Abuja.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations. May the good Lord bless all of you and the work that you do\u201d added Jime.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukuma Soludo has explained why he visited the detained leader of the proscribed People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody.\n\nSpeaking with Sam Omatseye on TVC Breakfast show on Monday, the former governor of Central Bank said the move was informed by his resolve to dialogue with anyone and everyone who can help his administration to restore peace and order in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, I did make it a point that I am ready to dialogue with anybody and everybody who will bring security and order to the state. And in that, we met with transporters, traditional rulers and prepared to give amnesty to those in the bush.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that, Nnamdi Kanu is the leader of IPOB, and it has Eastern Security Network. It is important to have full coverage in such that we need to bring everybody on board. I paid him a visit and I am very impressed by what he said in the presence of Senior DSS officials that he is detested by the spilling of innocent blood by some criminals unfortunately operating under the names of IPOB or ESN. But it\u2019s evident to me that quite a number of criminal gangs have emerged because it\u2019s a lucrative criminality \u2013 kidnapping, stealing etc. It has become lucrative business for them. Every criminal gang now claims to be a liberation movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne good thing is that I am happy hearing him denounce criminality, hearing him expressing regret about how things have become, he even told me he is not the one who authorised sit at home. And I didn\u2019t quite understand that initially and severally, his own officials of IPOB have been issuing statements condemning the sit at home and different gangs issuing counter statements. He has his followers but all we want is peace, law and order so that we have the desired development in the homeland.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to question about Kanu\u2019s sincerity, governor Soludo said he cannot read Kanu\u2019s mind or judge him by what he has said in the past. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have the gift to know what\u2019s going on in his mind. Whatever anybody said yesterday, may not matter, anyone could learn from history. The substance for me is hearing him regretting how the homeland has become and consequently asking his supporters to embrace peace and that\u2019s what my take away, not whatever he had said in the past. Now I have a job to do, and my primary role is to provide security for my people.\u201d\n\nMr Soludo who decried the state of criminality in the state, said his administration is determined to return peace and security to the homeland. \u201cWe are determined to return peace to the homeland.\u2019 We are pursuing security, peace and order in all fronts using the carrot and stick approach and the Anambra people are united about this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI must commend the Federal government and the security agencies. Nigeria is facing a lot of security challenges but I must commend them for the assistance. I must say so far so far, we are in sink. By the time I came, there was total silence, nobody was read to give information but that has changed now. There are seven numbers around me and people are cooperating.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former CBN governor said his first one hundred days in office is both challenging and interesting. He however said he is not actually a fan of the 100 days in office school of thought, adding that there\u2019s nothing unusual about the days because he was fully aware of the enormous tasked ahead when he applied for the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I am not a believer in the 100days of a thing but since you guys in the media kept asking, I think I have to create time to address some of what we have been able achieved. The 100days as I said in my address is pumping, it is challenging as expected. But I must said I applied for the job and the good people of Anambra employed me and when I applied I knew the challenges ahead. So no big surprises I must say.\n\nSpeaking on what informed his low key inauguration, the governor said governance is not about the glamour and noise people think it is about, but service to the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d The inaugural reminded us what governance is about. It\u2019s not about glamour, it\u2019s about service.\n\nWe just need to constantly remind ourselves of what governance is all about. On my first day in office, I spent about 8hrs plus. The first three and half hours was an extensive meeting with the security chiefs trying to review the humongous security challenges we have. I didn\u2019t come for the job to answer \u201cyour excellency\u201d I am hired to provide security, create enabling environment for business to thrive, create economic wealth. That\u2019s why they hired me. So I get to work every morning to address governance which is service to the people. We are the employees, the people are the employers.\u201d\n\nGovernor Soludo said the recommendations by his transition committee led by Dr Obby Ezekwesili are already being incorporated into his administration policies. \u201cThe Ezekwesili\u2019s committee came together and worked very hard. I must commend them for the great job they did. Basically, we have three operating documents \u2013 first, the Soludo solution, Anambra vision 2070 which I chaired and the transition committee report. Indeed these documents constitute our agenda for the state. We are determined to deliver on them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement",

          "title": "Boris Johnson Fights for Political Survival as He Prepares to Face MPs",
          "text": "Boris Johnson is fighting for political survival after two of his top ministers attacked his leadership and resigned.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid quit within 10 minutes of each other, followed by a flurry of junior ministers and aides.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Sunak said the public \u201crightly expect integrity from their government\u201d.\n\nBut new chancellor Nadhim Zahawi urged his colleagues to unite and said Mr Johnson was focused on delivery.\n\nMr Zahawi, who becomes the fourth chancellor in three years, was appointed alongside the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Steve Barclay, who became health secretary.\n\nA No 10 source said the new chancellor was \u201cmore dynamic and more aligned\u201d with Mr Johnson, and described the new health secretary as a \u201cmassive upgrade\u201d.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Mr Johnson will come under further pressure when he faces MPs at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\n\nHe is also due to give evidence to the Liaison Committee \u2013 a group of MPs who scrutinise the government\u2019s policy and decisions.\n\nBim Afolami \u2013 who quit as vice-chair of the party live on TV on Tuesday evening \u2013 said Downing Street\u2019s handling of the Chris Pincher affair had been \u201creally appalling\u201d and he could no longer \u201cdefend that sort of behaviour\u201d.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he supported Mr Johnson in his recent confidence vote in order to give him time to rebuild trust after Partygate, but things had \u201cgot a lot worse\u201d in recent weeks.\n\nNeither Mr Javid nor Mr Sunak have publicly spoken since standing down, but their resignation letters on Tuesday were highly critical of the PM.\n\nMr Javid warned the leadership was not \u201cacting in the national interest\u201d, while Mr Sunak said the public expected government to be conducted \u201cproperly, competently and seriously\u201d.\n\nOpposition party leaders urged cabinet ministers to join the pair and resign, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ready for a snap general election.\n\nConservative MP and former chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, told BBC Newsnight it was \u201cover\u201d for Mr Johnson, saying \u201che has neither the character nor the temperament to be our prime minister\u201d \u2013 and the only question was how long the affair would go on.\n\nBut no Tory MPs have declared a leadership challenge against the prime minister and several ministers have rallied around the PM, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss \u2013 one potential contender to replace him as Tory leader.\n\nShe said she was \u201c100% behind the PM\u201d, while cabinet ministers including Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Therese Coffey and Ben Wallace also indicated they would be staying in the government.\n\nTory backbencher Daniel Kawczynski suggested the resignations would ultimately strengthen Mr Johnson\u2019s position, adding they \u201ccould have triggered an avalanche against the prime minister but it hasn\u2019t\u201d.\n\nThe political drama unfolded on Tuesday evening, just minutes after Mr Johnson gave an interview to the BBC in which he admitted he had made a \u201cbad mistake\u201d in appointing Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip in February this year despite being aware of misconduct allegations against him.\n\nIt followed days of changing responses from No 10 over what exactly Mr Johnson knew about the allegations facing Mr Pincher when he gave him the job.\n\nThe row is the latest issue to prompt Conservative MPs to question the prime minister\u2019s leadership and direction of government.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s government has been dogged by a series of controversies in recent months, not least by a police investigation into parties in Downing Street during lockdown.\n\nSome Tory MPs have also expressed dissent over tax rises, the government\u2019s response to rising living costs and its policy direction.\n\nMr Sunak referenced tensions over the economy in his resignation letter, telling the PM: \u201cIn preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different.\u201d\n\nThe departures triggered a wave of resignations by junior Tories, including Mr Afolami, Solicitor General Alex Chalk, and four ministerial aides.\n\nPressure on the prime minister was also elevated last month by the loss of by-elections in Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield and the resignation of Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden.\n\nAnd the resignations come just weeks after he survived a no-confidence vote.\n\nThe PM is immune from a Conservative leadership challenge until June next year under party rules, after he won 59% of the vote.\n\nBut Tory rebels opposed to Mr Johnson\u2019s leadership are attempting to force a change in party rules to scrap the year-long gap between formal leadership challenges.\n\nThey want to use the upcoming elections to the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs to vote in members who would be willing to change the rules.\n\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen told the BBC the prime minister should resign and if he does not do so \u201cthe party will have to force him out\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 1922 committee will deal with this turbulent prime minister, it\u2019s what it was created for,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir said he would welcome a snap election and the country needed a change of government.\n\nHe said: \u201cAfter all the sleaze, all the failure, it\u2019s clear that this Tory government is now collapsing.\u201d\n\nThe next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson used his powers to call one.\n\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey told the BBC that Conservatives must do their \u201cpatriotic duty\u201d and \u201cget rid of Boris Johnson today\u201d.\n\nScottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said \u201cthe whole rotten lot\u201d in Mr Johnson\u2019s government should go, accusing ministers of \u201clying to the public\u201d.",
