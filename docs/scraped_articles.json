          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nMedical experts have said that hearing strange voices and seeing unusual things is a symptom of schizophrenia and not \u2018madness\u2019, as many Nigerians assume, noting that the medical condition affects a person\u2019s ability to think, feel and behave properly.\n\nThe experts also stated that a recent study suggested that about 1.86 million people suffer from schizophrenia in Nigeria.\n\nThe experts were reacting to recent reports that hardship and frustrations are fuelling schizophrenia and other mental health challenges in the country.\n\nAccording to the experts, a recent study by the World Health Organisation has confirmed that schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder affecting 20 million people worldwide.\n\nThe health condition, they said, is characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions and language, as well as hallucinations and delusions.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the Director of Pharmacy and Head of Department, Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, Mrs. Olawunmi Peters, disclosed that a recent research has suggested that about 1.86 million people suffer from schizophrenia in Nigeria.\n\nShe explained that people with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment.\n\n\u201cThe person with this disorder hears and sees things in clear consciousness, which other people can\u2019t hear or see. In some cases patients may exhibit a deficit of functions such as lack of motivation, reduced speech, social withdrawal, or bluntness of effect,\u201d Peters said.\n\nShe recalled a particular patient who strongly believed that her first son used a hammer to drive nails into her skull every day. She added that, even in the face of contrary evidence, the woman refused to believe otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe patient would often be seen laughing to herself for no reason, and at times becomes very angry, telling her friends that her family wanted her dead. At some point, she became restless and suspicious and refused to eat for days.\n\n\u201cShe also described hearing voices abusing her and discussing her actions; and no matter how much you tried to talk her out of it, she was still experiencing these distressing symptoms,\u201d Peters said.\n\nThe director noted that a patient suffering from schizophrenia can only become violent when he or she is in the acute phase of the illness.\n\n\u201cAnd this usually happens when the condition remains untreated. Many patients who receive treatment are actually able to function well in society and build careers, especially when they are compliant with their medications and therapy sessions.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine how disconcerting it can be when your live experience or reality is doubted by everyone around you and no matter how much you try to explain that you hear these voices, they insist that you are unwell?\n\n\u201cYet, you have no fever, no headache, no body pain, or any other measurable signs. This is the reality of so many schizophrenic patients and we can\u2019t blame them for their condition because they did not choose to have schizophrenia,\u201d she said.\n\nPeters added that, with adequate interventions from the clinical psychiatrists, pharmacists, nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers, individuals with schizophrenia can live a normal life.\n\nA consultant clinical pharmacist and National Chairman, Association of Hospital and Administrative Pharmacists of Nigeria, Dr. Kingsley Amibor, disclosed that in a population of over 200 million, Nigeria accounts for 100,000 new cases of schizophrenia on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cIt is often triggered in late adolescent age, around 19 to 20 years. Some may not be detected till they are in their early 30s, with symptoms like false belief (illusion), hallucination, while some have fixed mindsets. There is nothing you can tell them that they will believe.\n\n\u201cAlso, 48 percent of identical twins risk having schizophrenia. We are not saying all the children will have it but there is a risk that some will have it and environmental factors and viral infections play a role,\u201d Amibor said.\n\nHis view was corroborated by the Deputy Director in charge of Pharmacy at FNPH, Yaba, Dr. OyetunjiAjayi.\n\nAjayi disclosed that drug abuse or long-time substance use might trigger schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cThis condition can be treated or reversed. Schizophrenia is not a direct cause of death for anybody but the condition might get worse if they don\u2019t get the required treatment or medication.\n\n\u201cWhere I work, we have over 50,000 new cases annually. In the times of COVID-19, we had an average of 10-15 new cases daily and this is because it is people that know that the condition is treatable that come for treatment,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\nBy: Abayomi Adeshida, Abuja\n\nConstitutional Lawyer and Public Affairs Analyst, Dr. Kayode Ajulo has warned the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Alhaji Abubakar Malami to review a recent pronouncement attributed to him which threatened a legal action against anyone found to use the social media network, Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAjulo stressed that the need to exercise caution in carrying out a legal action was necessary at this time because it would be an exercise in futility since the offence for which the threat was based was not known to the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nIn a media release well circulated in Abuja on Sunday with the title: LEGALITY OR OTHERWISE OF THE DIRECTIVE TO PROSECUTE VIOLATORS OF TWITTER BAN IN NIGERIA\u201d , Ajulo gave instances of cases that were similar to the matter and attempted to suggest that the Justice Minister should desist from a wild goose chase.\n\nAccording to the lawyer in the statement, \u201cSequel to the temporary ban of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government on Friday, 4th June, 2021, my attention has been drawn to a directive credited to the Attorney General of the Federation for the prosecution of violators of the ban of the blogging company in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site, it must be noted that the Nigerian democracy is a constitutional democracy based on the rule of law. Where the rule of law reigns, political expediency ought to be sacrificed on the altar of the rule of law so as to guarantee the continued existence of democratic institutions fashioned to promote social values of liberty, orderly conduct and development.\n\n\u201d The Constitution of a nation is the fons et origo, not only of the jurisprudence but also of the legal system of the nation. It is the beginning and the end of the legal system. In Greek language, it is the alpha and the omega and the barometer with which Government actions are measured.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site in Nigeria, it is imperative to note that the provisions of Section 36(12) of the 1999 Constitution are clear to the effect no one shall be prosecuted for an offence not known to Law, Ajulo submitted..\n\nHe went further to state the provision of Section 36 (12) for the sake of emphasis and for avoidance of doubt, and that section reads, \u201d Subject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a Law of a State, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of a law.\n\n\u201cThe cases of Aoko Vs. Fagbemi (1961) 1 All NLR 400; A.G.F. Vs. Isong (1986) 1QLRN 75 are also quite pungent on this.\n\n\u201d I have carefully spectated the contents of our various penal laws and nowhere is a Citizen of the Country prohibited from receiving or disseminating information which as a right guaranteed under Section 39 of the Constitution,\u201d Ajulo pointed out.\n\nTherefore, he concluded with the following words of advice, \u201cWhile I am weary to believe that the statement credited to the Honourable Attorney General of Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, is with respect, inchoate as the position of law is clear and unambiguous and whatever directive issued for the prosecution of violators of the ban of twitter blog in Nigeria runs contrary to the Letters and the spirit of the Constitution and same anachronistic in a democractic society where rule of law ought to be the guiding compass.",

This onslaught against a revered priest in Igbo land should stop forthwith\u201d\n\nHe also attacked the Catholic Bishop of the Enugu Diocese, Bishop Calistus Onaga.\n\n\u201cThe Bishop should cease from trying to silence Mbaka. Mbaka has been talking under two past Bishops- Eneja and Gbuji, they did not disturb him. We are in the know that the FG is on the neck of Onaga to silence Mbaka.\n\n\u201cThey want Mbaka banned and sent out of the Catholic Church.

          "text": "Fiery Enugu Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka resumed his Adoration Ministry yesterday, Sunday, after serving a 30-day ban.\n\nHowever, DAILY POST reports that despite a directive from the head of his Diocese, Bishop Calistus Onaga, the priest still delved into political matters.\n\nThis is coming amid reports that officials of the Department of State Services, DSS, were at the Adoration Ministry to invite the Clergyman to Abuja.\n\nMbaka made the claim while addressing his followers at the Adoration Ground in Enugu on Sunday.\n\nThose after Fr. Mbaka have not given up \u2013 Ohanaeze youths claim\n\nIt could be recalled that as part of conditions for him to re-open the Adoration, the Ministry was changed to a Chaplaincy, with a caution that he should stay away from politics.\n\nMbaka, however, mounted the pulpit and again lambasted the present government.\n\n\u201cWho is beaten and told not to cry\u201d, he thundered in vernacular.\n\n\u201cThe body and blood of Jesus is the solution to what you are passing through, it is the supernatural solution to what Nigeria is passing through; in a time like this when the youths are passing through the corridors of unemployment, when the youths are crying, when there is banditry, when a lot of terrorist activities are going on, we need the power of the Holy Ghost for holistic solution.\n\n\u201cWhat are we talking about? In a time like this when the whole country men cannot find a solution in the government, people will find a solution in the body and blood of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cDid they tell me to shut up and start saying that the country is good? The country is not good. God will fight for this country. The country is not well. Woe betide a prophet of God who will be silent in time of evil, that person is not a prophet, no matter the threat, no matter the attack, a prophet is a prophet at all times,\u201d he declared.\n\nApparently condemning the role of his Bishop, he said a retired Bishop Eneja of the Diocese \u201cwill not be happy wherever he is hearing that Fr. Mbaka is dumb in a time like this.\n\nDSS denies arresting Fr Mbaka after calls for Buhari\u2019s sack\n\n\u201cWhat will be, will be, it is a matter of time. Adoration Ministry is a prophetic ministry.\n\n\u201cWas it not on Wednesday that I came back to my house after 30 days? I came back on Wednesday, I celebrated mass with some of the leaders of the ministry. By Thursday morning, I got a call from where I was that DSS people from Abuja came to the gate, and they came with a letter of invitation to Abuja, over what? Listen.\n\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand is that the mother Church in Nigeria should be cowed down to a level of Lilliputian, all these are attempts to dumbfound the priest of God, all the priests could be dumbfounded but no prophet could be dumbfounded. It is our duty to protect the sheep in this time when there is killing everywhere, bloodshed everywhere, hunger everywhere.\n\n\u201cAnybody by any means who will stop people from worshipping here will regret it. We must discern when God is working and when the devil is working. Let those who are inviting me to Abuja and elsewhere\u2026they don\u2019t understand history, this is the same Fr. Mbaka that spoke against Abacha and co, this is the same Fr. Mbaka under Eneja, who went to Minna and spoke to Babangida face to face about what was wrong with his government. This is the same Fr. Mbaka under Bishop Gbuji, who went to Obasanjo in Aso Rock, face to face and spoke to him. I perform under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, I don\u2019t do anything to get money but save souls. Under Bishop Gbuji I ministered to the late Yar\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cIf they are attacking me here and there, even from those who should save me, no wahala, I heard the security man did not receive the letter, he could have received it, he told them that Fr. is coming on Sunday to celebrate mass, that they can come to give him the letter. If they know that the anointing flowing from this ground is too hot for them, let them change.\n\n\u201cIf you are the one sent to cow Fr. Mbaka down, it is a stupid assignment because you cannot achieve it. Those who are dreaming that Fr. Mbaka will soon be quiet, you are wasting your time\u2026\u201d\n\nInsecurity: Fr Mbaka under attack for calling for Buhari\u2019s impeachment",

          "text": "By Lucas Ajanaku\n\nThe synching of National Identity Number (NIN) with Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) does not provide absolute guarantee that kidnappers, bandits, cattle rustlers and killer herders will be apprehended, experts said at the weekend in Lagos.\n\nThe experts, who spoke against the backdrop of rising insecurity in the country and the seeming failure of NIN and SIM to track down the criminals, said a combination of technology, intelligence and holistic collaboration among the security agencies would do the magic.\n\nThe President, Nigerian Computer Society (NCS), Prof Adesina Sodiya, said it is obvious that the NIN-SIM information is not enough to track down criminals, especially those engaged in kidnap-for-ransom as they use the telephone number of the captives to communicate with the family members of their victims.\n\nHe said the Federal Government should move further to extend biometric information gathering of the citizens to cover voice recognition along with intelligence gathering and satellite technology to track the criminal elements.\n\nSodiya recalled that aside cash payment to the kidnappers, parents of the kidnapped students of Greenfield University in Kaduna, were also asked to buy bikes.\n\nHe said in very sane climes, microchips would have been installed on the bikes to facilitate information gathering about the location of the kidnappers.\n\nHe said the group has prepared a blueprint which will be handed over to the Federal Government soon.\n\nThe former president, Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusol Teniola, said the difficulty faced by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the security agencies in using NIN-SIM to track down criminal elements in the country is understandable.\n\nHe said the efficacy of using telephone numbers to track criminals was on the front burner of a conversation in 2019.\n\nTeniola who is the Nigeria National Coordinator, Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), said people who were bent on committing criminal activities would find a way to circumvent the system put in place by state actors, adding that in other countries, technology tools are being used to track down criminals.\n\nLike Prof Sodiya, Teniola said satellite technology should be deployed along side location based service (LBS) which can monitor the signal of the kidnappers\u2019 phone if they have one in close proximity with the victims. He also stressed the place of intelligence and the need to do a lot of data analytics to correlate the available data. He said the criminal elements too could use SIM cards bought from neighbouring countries, roam same to carry out their nefarious activities without leaving any signature through which they could be traced behind.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a SIM linked to a NIN, it is the information that is in the hands of the intelligence community that can be used to solve a crime. It does not solve a crime. It is recognized that in other countries, other pieces of technology, in addition to this, are used to identify what happened during criminal activities.\n\n\u201cIn my expert opinion, there should be the use of satellite imaging in addition to the cell site information. It requires not only the technology but also data analytics. It requires the human knowledge and expertise to be able to piece this information together in very quick manner to resolve kidnapping in an expedient way.\n\n\u201cIf you have all the data presented to you, you still need to corroborate and correlate the information to identify those that are involved in criminal activity. So if the information is not being provided by the criminals in terms of registering NIN, how do you know who these criminals are?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou can see we need more infrastructure; we need satellite imaging; we need CCTvs; we need other forms of technology combined holistically to be able to solve this problem. The NIM-SIM assists but does not solve the problem on its own,\u201d Teniola said.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBlood flowed freely in Igangan, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapaland in Oyo State, on Saturday night, as gunmen dispatched over 45 persons to their early graves in the town.\n\nBesides, the five-hour invasion also led to burning of more than 60 houses, while over 160 vehicles were also destroyed, apart from a petrol filling station and the palace of Ashigangan of Igangan, Oba Lasisi Adeoye, that were also razed.\n\nIt was in the same Igangan that angry youths razed the village and vehicles of the Sarkin Fulani of Oyo State, Alhaji Abdulkadir Salihu, in February, this year, after the popular Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, held a town hall meeting in the town. Salihu was evicted from the town based on allegations of aiding and abeitting killings, kidnapping and destruction of farmland in the area.\n\nImpeccable sources said the invaders stormed Igangan at about 11pm, on Saturday, and operated till 4am, yesterday, before leaving the town in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe bandits, according to sources, were about 50 and they invaded the town on more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nCommunity leaders speak on bloodbath\n\nThe Secretary of Farmers Union in Igangan, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, said many lives were lost during the invasion, adding that the invaders shot many residents dead, while security agents also neutralised some of the attackers.\n\nThe convener of Igangan Development Advocate, Oladiran Oladokun, said: \u201cOn numerous occasions, Ibrahim, Seriki Saliu\u2019s son kept threatening that Igangan would be razed down to ashes. He had the audacity to proclaim this on social media as well as on radio shows; perhaps, his words were taken as mere groans, but local vigilantes at Igangan kept receiving the news of impending danger.\n\n\u201cThe state, I believe, thought it\u2019s just another hype, for we notified the state of our fears on the 14th of April, when covert information reached us of a meeting of the Fulani, towards fulfilling their oath of allegiance towards reprisals.\n\n\u201cIf we had not made a little cover, perhaps, as Ibarahim, son of Seriki threatened, Igangan would have become a dunghill of ashes; or, perhaps, this is just their beginning.\u201d\n\nA former caretaker chairman of Ibarapa North, where Igangan is located, Tunji Omolewu, stated: \u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11pm. We were on our way from Ekiti, where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally. I got to Ibadan around 12am, and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. The palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station, too, was burnt. We are assembled here.\u201d\n\nPolice confirm incident, begin investigation\n\nThe Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the invasion of Igangan in Ibarapa zone of the state by unknown assailants during which many lives and property were destroyed.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer for the command, Mr. Adewale Osifeso, who made the confirmation, yesterday, said the incident began at about 11:10pm, on Saturday.\n\nAsked to comment on the figure of people that were killed during the invasion, Osifeso stated: \u201cCasualty figure would be premised upon the completion of the ongoing comprehensive investigations, please.\u201d\n\nOyo Assembly Speaker, Allaafin condemn attack\n\nMeanwhile, the Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Debo Ogundoyin, who hails from Eruwa, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapa, has condemned the fresh attack on Igangan, by bandits and suspected criminal herders overnight.\n\nAlso, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, condemned the and call on residents of Igangan and the entire state to be calm.\n\nGovernor Makinde calls for calm\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has appealed to residents of the state to remain calm as security operatives have taken control of the situation in Igangan, where people suspected to be criminal herdsmen killed about 20 persons in the early hours of yesterday.",

          "title": "Nigeria at crossroads as oil price nears $75 per barrel",
          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigeria appears to be at crossroads over the steady rise in oil prices which hit $72 per barrel over the weekend, distorting earlier projections of the World Bank and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which had earlier predicted a low price regime for 2021.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil price benchmark is gradually making a rebound with a barrel of oil likely to hit $75 in the weeks ahead and probably above, a development that signaled a ray of hope for the troubled sector which has battled a low price regime occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic since last year.\n\nIronically, while other oil producing countries with robust refining capacity are anxious to reap the gains of higher oil prices, Nigeria seems to be fretting because a higher price regime will definitely translate to increased cost of refining and higher fuel subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, gains will be reaped for the country as its 2021 oil price projection was based on an estimate of $40 per barrel, indicating a daily gain of $57.6 daily for the country at 1.8 million barrels of oil production per day.\n\nBut the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, had warned that states might have nothing to share from the FAAC because the country spends about N112 billion monthly subsidizing fuel as a result of the inefficient state of the nation\u2019s refineries which currently is in comatose.\n\nThere was anxiety and panic in the country in April when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had, in a letter to the Accountant General of the Federation , projected that it would deduct N112 billion oil and gas proceeds from the Federation Account for fuel subsidy in order to ensure continuous supply of petroleum products in the country and guarantee energy security\n\nWith daily consumption of petrol at 55 million litres per day and oil at $72 per barrel, the N112 billion monthly subsidy claims may balloon to over N200 billion monthly.\n\nSpeaking in April at the fifth edition of the special ministerial briefings coordinated by the presidential communications team, Kyari said while the actual cost of importation and handling charges of petrol amounted to N234 per litre, the government was selling the product at N162 per litre.

          "summary": "Brent crude, the global oil price benchmark is gradually making a rebound with a barrel of oil likely to hit $75 in the weeks ahead and probably above, a development that signaled a ray of hope for the troubled sector which has battled a low price regime occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic since last year.\nIronically, while other oil producing countries with robust refining capacity are anxious to reap the gains of higher oil prices, Nigeria seems to be fretting because a higher price regime will definitely translate to increased cost of refining and higher fuel subsidy.\nOn the other hand, gains will be reaped for the country as its 2021 oil price projection was based on an estimate of $40 per barrel, indicating a daily gain of $57.6 daily for the country at 1.8 million barrels of oil production per day.\nWhile pump price steadily rose, the face-off between labour and Federal Government kept the latter in a tight corner.\nThe unions had earlier forced the government to reverse the pump price from N168 per litre last year to N162.",

          "text": "Condolence messages have been pouring in following the demise of Prophet TB Joshua.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he would be missed by his followers all over the world not only for his spiritual contributions, but for touching many lives through philanthropic gestures.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, Buhari who commiserated with the family and members of SCOAN on the passing of their father and founder, urged them to take solace in the knowledge that life is not measured and defined by chronological longevity, but by enduring legacies and lives touched positively.\n\nThis is as Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, said he received the news of the death with a heavy heart.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu, in a statement by his media aide, Richard Olatunde, said the renowned cleric was a blessing to humanity and a great Ambassador of the state whose ministry was noted for charity.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Prophet Joshua\u2019s demise came as a rude shock. The pains are not mere emotional flashes; they are indeed piercing. The Ondo State born Pastor and Televangelist was a philanthropist whose exit will be sorely missed by many.\n\n\u201cProphet Joshua was committed to giving and was more often, inexorably imbued with calmness while lifting the downtrodden. As a televangelist, he did not just win souls for Christ, he was passionate about changing lives.\n\n\u201cHe demonstrated timelessly, an alluring service to humanity and compassion by assisting not only his home local government, Akoko North West. Other adjoining local governments in Akoko land benefitted from his large heart of benevolence.\u201d\n\nKogi Governor, Yahaya Bello, said the cleric would be missed for his audacious truth telling and his peaceful advocacies as well as great concern for humanity most especially, widows, orphan and people living with disabilities\n\nWhile he prayed for God to comfort and strengthen the family, church and those greatly hurt by his death, he urged them not to derail for the footprints of the late clergy mostly his humanitarian endeavours\n\nIn his reaction, Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, said he was saddened by the pastor\u2019s death, who he said impacted the lives of millions of people across the world.\n\n\u201cPastor Joshua deployed his gift of delivering the word of God in relatable terms to advance the church of Christ and brought laughter, solace and comfort to many with Christ\u2019s message of love.\u201d\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, in a statement, said the evangelist will be remembered not only for spreading the gospel of Christ, but also for his humanitarian works through which he positively touched millions of lives.\n\nHis death shocking, painful \u2013 Kalu\n\nLamenting the demise of the renowned preacher and evangelist, former Abia governor and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu said Pastor Joshua was popular beyond the shores of Nigeria, adding that he would be greatly missed by his followers.\n\nIn his condolence message, Kalu prayed for eternal rest for the deceased.\n\n\u201cHis death is shocking and painful. He was committed to spreading the gospel of God through his religious and philanthropic platforms. Pastor Joshua was simple, kind-hearted, generous and easy going.\n\n\u201cHe played a key role in human capital development through philanthropy and counselling. His demise has no doubt, left a big vacuum in the Synagogue.\n\n\u201cHowever, the congregation should take solace in the fact that the late clergyman contributed immensely to the growth of the Synagogue church and the larger community by touching lives positively.\n\n\u201cThe late Pastor Joshua will be remembered as a notable spiritual leader with passion for empowering the poor and vulnerable in the society.\u201d\n\nWhile praying for the repose of the soul of the deceased, Kalu extended his condolences to the people and government of Ondo state over the sad loss.\n\nJonathan, Arthur Eze, Gani Adams mourn\n\nFormer president, Goodluck Jonathan, described the late Joshua as a devout man of God, who served God and humanity with relentless passion during his life.\n\nThe former president in a message by Ikechukwu Eze, in Abuja, yesterday, said he impacted millions of lives across Nigeria and the globe.\n\nHe said he was saddened to hear about the death of T.B Joshua, at a young age of 57.\n\n\u201cTB Joshua was a devout man of God who served God and humanity with relentless passion.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of sound doctrine, meek and faithful to his call and passion of reconciling men to God and offering hope to humanity.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian leader, TB Joshua and his ministry exemplified Christ in faith, love and charity; positively impacting the lives of many Nigerians, Africans and millions of people across the world.\n\n\u201cI condole with his family, his church and millions of his followers across the world. May God grant them peace and strength to cope with this loss,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nThe former president also prayed God to grant millions of Joshua\u2019s followers across the world the strength to cope with his exit.\n\nAcclaimed philanthropist and oil merchant, Prince Arthur Eze, described his death as a global calamity for the entire human race and Christians worldwide.\n\nAccording to Prince Eze, with TB Joshua\u2019s death, Nigeria has lost a precious citizen who stood out as a symbol of national unity and pride.\n\nHe said the death was a big loss to the preaching and spreading of the gospel and entire Christendom world wide.\n\nPrince Arthur Eze said the prophet would be missed by his teeming admirers and followers to whom he dedicated his spiritual powers, healing and delivering them from evil spirits and divers health challenges.\n\nProphet Joshua he said was used to perform a lot of notable healings which immortalised him.\n\nThe philanthropiat described TB Joshua as a humble man of God who the Almighty used to touch many souls in terms of philanthropy and spiritual cleansing.\n\n\u201cIndeed TB Joshua was a religious iroko tree whose life gave succour and salvation to humanity\u201d he lamented.\n\nPrince Arthur Eze prayed for the repose of the soul of Prophet TB Joshua while believing that \u201che is already seated in the right hand of our lord jesus christ.\u201d\n\nPrince Eze however expressed regrets that those whom he was used to cure and were still being healed from different ailments and health problems would miss his ministrations for spiritual freedom and purity.\n\nThe Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has described the death as a rude shock, painful and devastating.\n\nAdams described the late prophet as an \u2018Iroko\u2019 tree and an abode for many.\n\n\u201cT.B. Joshua found favour in spreading the Gospel of God through his ministry.\n\n\u201cAccording to the words of God in the Bible, the Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants, the prophets.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult for me to come to terms with the reality of his death. It was very sad. Prophet T.B. Joshua lived and died for God. His life was a complete definition of God\u2019s generousity and philosophy.\u201d\n\nTerrible loss to Yoruba nation \u2013 Akintoye\n\nIlana Omo Oodua (IOO) said his demise was a loss to the Yoruba nation.\n\nLeader of the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, in a statement by Maxwell Adeleye, said he was a great servant of God with outreaches touching most part of the world and bringing charity to the needy everywhere, including his people in the Akoko Area of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cIn many countries across the world, people watched his ministry on TV as he brought his gospel message with hope and joy. We, his people, will miss him greatly. We all pray that God will accept him into the joy of heaven,\u201d the renowned historian and Second Republic member of the Nigerian Senate said.\n\nIkotun community youths mourn\n\nThe youths in the community were also seen gathered in twos and threes speaking in hushed tones. They wondered what would become of their fate now that the man who brought rapid development to the area was no more.",

          "text": "By Chika Abanobi, Gabriel Dike, Job Osazuwa, Chinelo Obogo, Doris Obinna, Steve Agbota, Vera Bassey and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nProphet Temitope Balogun Joshua, prominent pastor and founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), may have had premonition of his death as he reportedly made veiled reference to it in his last official outing at the church located in Ikotun Egbe, a densely populated Lagos suburb.\n\nUntil his death, he ran the Christian Television programme called Emmanuel TV and often toured different countries carrying deliverance and healing sessions.\n\nA statement by the church said the influential preacher and philanthropist died on Saturday, barely a week shy of his 58th birthday.\n\nThe statement titled Prophet TB Joshua \u2013 June 12th 1963 to June 5th 2021, read: \u201cSurely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.\u201d \u2013 Amos 3:7\n\n\u201cOn Saturday 5th June 2021, Prophet TB Joshua spoke during the Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting: \u2018Time for everything \u2013 time to come here for prayer and time to return home after the service.\u2019 God has taken His servant Prophet TB Joshua home \u2013 as it should be by divine will. His last moments on earth were spent in the service of God. This is what he was born for, lived for and died for.\n\n\u201cAs Prophet TB Joshua says, \u2018The greatest way to use life is to spend it on something that will outlive it.\u2019 Prophet TB Joshua leaves a legacy of service and sacrifice to God\u2019s Kingdom that is living for generations yet unborn.\n\n\u201cThe Synagogue, Church Of All Nations and Emmanuel TV Family appreciate your love, prayers and concern at this time and request a time of privacy for the family.\n\nHere are Prophet TB Joshua\u2019s last words: \u201cWatch and pray. One life for Christ is all we have; one life for Christ is so dear.\u201d\n\nDescribing his last moment, a worshipper at the church said Joshua refused to touch any church member during Saturday\u2019s preaching which is against his usual practice.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Saturday), he gave us the signal, but we weren\u2019t paying attention; he said he was not going to lay hands on any of us and gave the microphone to someone and asked that person if he knew why he would not lay hands (on people). That person said no and Papa smiled. He said, \u2018you will soon understand.\u2019 Papa told us there will be a heavy rainfall today and that he might not be there to witness it but we didn\u2019t consider his words. He asked us to keep praying and praying. We didn\u2019t even know what for.\n\nAmong those who offered insight into into how he died, yesterday, was the Lagos Police Commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu. Joshua, he said, was officially pronounced dead by a hospital around 3am.\n\n\u201cI do not know the cause of his death yet. But the information we have is that he was conducting service. Along the line, he felt uncomfortable, walked to his apartment himself and never came back.\n\n\u201cHis people thought he probably wanted to rest or refresh, but when they didn\u2019t see him after a long while, they went in search of him and found him in an unusual position.It was around 3am that he was pronounced dead by a hospital.\u201d\n\nCause of death unknown\n\nThe cause of his death has not yet been made public by either his family or the church. However, long-time member of the Church told Daily Sun that reports that TB Joshua was ill before he died were not true. The source said Joshua was in perfect health and did not show any symptom of fatigue or illness and was his usual boisterous self.\n\n\u201cAfter he had finished preaching, he handed over the microphone he was using to one of the wise men and as he was leaving, he slumped and died. It is not true that he was sick for days as some are reporting. He didn\u2019t have any terminal illness that we know of. In fact, the church was seriously preparing for his birthday which was to come up on June 12. If he was sick, the church would not have been preparing for such a huge event. He wasn\u2019t sick and I can tell you in all honesty that he fell down and died,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u2018Our prophet can\u2019t die\u2019\n\nRegardless of the statement posted on its website confirming his death, many of his faithful have insisted he was not dead.\n\n\u201cIt is fake news! And it will forever remain so. Papa cannot die. It is a lie from the pit of hell. Please don\u2019t believe it. My spirit has never failed me. The spirit of God in me has not told me he has died, he cannot die. He will rise again.\u201d\n\nAnother faithful was caught telling guards that barricaded the entrance to the church: \u201cOpen this gate for us, let us go in and convince him that we\u2019re waiting for him. He cannot die like that, even in the next 10 to 20 years, TB Joshua cannot die. He is only in a coma, communicating with God in the spiritual realm.\u201d\n\nOne believed the cleric is only taking a nap.\n\n\u201cThere are plans underway for his birthday, which is this Saturday. How can he just die like that? How will we celebrate his birthday and he won\u2019t be present? Papa is only taking a nap, we give him only seven days, you will be shocked. He will rise again.\u201d\n\nThey believed that the man of God was only sleeping or the news was a kind of joke that must not be accepted.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for my daddy to die. He is a true prophet of God, who has conquered death long ago. When I heard the news, I laughed it off because I know our prophet is bigger than death. So, no cause for alarm,\u201d a female member said.\n\nAnother member, Mr. Uche Okechukwu Chima, told reporters that it was impossible for a man who has been raising the dead to die.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is a trial of faith. I have been a member of this church since 2008, so I know what I\u2019m saying. Those of us who really know the prophet can attest to the fact that he is not dead, and he can\u2019t die when he still has a lot to do for the people. In matter of hours or days, what I\u2019m saying will be confirmed. I have the confidence that my prophet is sleeping, not dead.\u201d\n\nOur husband is gone -Widows\n\nMany of the widows, who lined up at the entrance to the church, told Daily Sun that they were directly hit by the prophet\u2019s death. The described TB Joshua as a man who was not tired of giving them food and making them happy.\n\nThe widows converged in front of the church wailing and singing, \u201cour husband is gone. How do we cater for ourselves? Who will feed us? Our husband is too young to die. Hope hunger wlll not kill us? God return TB Joshua back to us.\u201d\n\nIn tears, they recalled how the man of God had on many occasions donated cash, foodstuff and other consumables to make life better for them. One of the widows, in her 70s, described Joshua as their adopted husband who fed and clothed them, even when their relatives abandoned them.\n\nMrs Funmilayo Ojo said he was an angel sent by God to feed widows and other less privileged people in Africa.\n\n\u201cApart from Christmas period, he reached out to widows every month. He placed our children on scholarship and took care of them.\u201d\n\nMama Ezekiel\u2019s said the late TB Joshua has been supportive since the demise of her husband.\n\n\u201cI have three kids and daddy has been the one supporting with their school fees after the death of my husband as well as my rent since I moved down to Ikotun. I don\u2019t know what would become of the thousands of people he has been catering for,\u201d she lamented.\n\nMrs Sholanke Maria, 76, who came down to the church from Ikorodu, said TB Joshua healed her 53-year-old son who had hole in his heart.\n\n\u201cI went to see him at the mountain and told him about my sick child. He prayed for me. He gave me N50,000 to buy food and he also gave me anointing oil. I went to fetch his water and gave my son. And God healed my son.\u201d\n\nAnother aged woman who did not give her name said: \u201cI am one of the widows that TB Joshua helps even though I am not a member of this church. I didn\u2019t come here yesterday but at 3pm on Saturday, I saw a man walk pass me in my room and I felt maybe it was the shadow of my neighbour. But no, my neighbour was not around and I was not even bothered again but this morning, I saw N1,050 in my Bible. I also didn\u2019t pay attention, it\u2019s not my money, there is no one else in the house to put the money there. I was just grateful to God because I know it is divine provision but as I got to my church today, already cleaning as an usher, I got a call, I had to rush down here. My helper is gone but his spirit will never leave me.\u201d\n\nSome other members around the woman confirmed that the prophet said he would visit them.\n\nKinsmen, traditional ruler, others demand corpse\n\nThe traditional ruler of Arigidi-Akoko in Ondo State, hometown of the late founder of Synagogue Oba Yisa Olanipekun has demanded the corpse of the late cleric.\n\nThe monarch in a statement urged the church authorities to ensure the corpse was brought to Arigidi-Akoko for burial.\n\nHe said the late prophet represented so many things to them, hence the need to have him buried in his home town.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Zaki-in-Council, the High Chiefs, the Elders and immediate family members of our late son, I commiserate with the president, the Governor of Ondo State, my beloved people of Arigidi and the people of Nigeria in general for the loss of our illustrious son. I pray that God, in His infinite mercies will wipe off our tears,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference\u201d \u2013Section 39 (1) CFRN\n\nDavidson Iriekpen, Nseobong Okon-Ekong, Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe federal government has continued to face searing criticisms of its decision to suspend the operation of the American microblogging social network, Twitter, in Nigeria as some Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) yesterday told THISDAY that the action contravened Section 39 (1) of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThey also dismissed the directive of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to the Federal Director of Public Prosecution, to arrest and prosecute any user of Twitter in defiance of the suspension order, as offensive to Section 36 (12) of the Constitution as altered.\n\nSection 39 (1) stipulates: \u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyers argued that the suspension amounted to a hindrance of the citizens\u2019 right to receive information.\n\nThey further argued that the threat of prosecution by the AGF has no basis in law as it clearly violates Section 36 (12), which states: \u201cSubject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that the offence is defined and the penalty, therefore, is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of law.\u201d\n\nMalami, had in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu, had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to work with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy to ensure speedy prosecution of alleged violators.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also described the suspension of Twitter as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nJoining the fray, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives threatened to sue the federal government over the suspension of Twitter operations.\n\nThe lawyers, in separate interviews with THISDAY yesterday, described the action of the government as illegal, null and void and unenforceable.\n\nThey said the suspension in the first place was illegal because it infringed on the fundamental human rights of the citizens.\n\nThe lawyers, citing portions of the law, stated that the government cannot prosecute anyone under a non-existent law.\n\nHuman Rights activists and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ozekhome, citing decisions from the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, said: \u201cNo citizen of Nigeria can be tried or punished for an alleged offence not created by law.\u201d\n\nOzekhome, who faulted the directive of Malami, warned that the government should \u201cbe ready to build thousands of prisons across all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria so as to accommodate the deluge of \u2018erring\u2019 Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, there must be a statutory provision creating an offence before any person can be convicted for the said offence.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe punishment too must be specifically named in a legislation. The apex court emphatically stated that it is rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act that is not qualified as an offence not defined or stated (codified) in any law and the punishment thereof prescribed.\n\n\u201cAll the above judicial authorities are crystal clear that neither Malami nor the DPP, nor this government, can prosecute any Twitter user. Using Twitter is not a known crime or written offence.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the National Assembly has not enacted any law banning the use of social media, including Twitter, Ozekhome said the mere verbal pronouncement, declaration, directives or threats by Malami could not amount to a law validly passed by the National Assembly.\n\nChief Godwin Obla (SAN) described the suspension of Twitter as senseless and not legally justiciable because there is no order proscribing Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nObla, who noted that what the federal government did in the first place was to stop telecommunication companies from allowing Twitter to use their platform to operate in Nigeria, said that no Nigerian could be punished for merely using Twitter which according to him is an online means of disseminating information.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is nowhere and I have not seen the order by the Attorney-General proscribing Twitter because there must be an order. Can the federal government on its own have breached the citizens\u2019 right to disseminate and to hold and manage information? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cSo, if a Nigerian citizen is using another IT platform, say, the United States platform, he can disseminate information; it\u2019s a piece of online information, it\u2019s not physical. If my Twitter account is a US Twitter account, I can tweet from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ban does not make sense. It is not legally justiciable. I do not see how it can be enforced, and I don\u2019t see how any citizen can be found guilty of such an offence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN), wondered when a pronouncement by a mi\n\nnister becomes a law on which citizens could be prosecuted.\n\nHe said for anyone to be arrested and arraigned before a court of law, there must be an offence, adding that in this instance, there is no known law for which a person has disobeyed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any law that says if there is a pronouncement by a minister, it becomes an offence,\u201d he said, explaining: \u201cTo arrest someone there must be an offence, a written offence. There must be a law; you must refer to a law that says anybody that disobeys an order or a statement by the minister is an offence but there is nothing like that, there is definitely no law like that.\u201d\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Chief Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), also stated that there is no known law on which Nigerians could be prosecuted for using Twitter and added that the power to make criminal laws rests with the National Assembly and not the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not aware of any law that has been enacted by the National Assembly. The president cannot enact criminal law, only the National Assembly can do so.\n\n\u201cCriminal laws are not enacted in secrecy; it has to be published before it can be effective.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN), said, President Muhammadu Buhari lacked the power to use state institutions to fight personal battles.\n\nDaudu also clarified that the decision of Twitter to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account \u201cis not a matter between Nigeria and the social networking service.\u201d\n\nHe made this clarification in his response to THISDAY\u2019s inquiries on the constitutionality of the federal government\u2019s decision to suspend Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria.\n\nDaudu said every Nigerian operating a Twitter account \u201cdoes so in his own name, even if the underlying objective is to promote the objectives and aspirations of his constituency, business outfit or even office.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said Buhari, though a very eminent personality \u201cis an individual customer of Twitter with no greater rights than the other millions of persons who have also subscribed to Twitter and agreed to their rules and conditions of membership.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter perceived that Buhari broke its rules and applying one of the sanctions open to it removed the offending tweet. Whether the account was blocked or suspended is really not the issue at this point in time,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, therefore, said the president lacked the power to use state apparatus and institutions \u201cto hit or get back at Twitter, which is what he has done in retaliation by banning them from Nigeria using state institutions such as the NBC and the NCC to deprive all Nigerians of their access to Twitter.\u201d\n\nMr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) also stated that before anyone could be punished for any offence in Nigeria, the offence must be defined and the punishment thereof must be prescribed in a written law.\n\n\u201cThis is what is stipulated by Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that except there is an existing law that proscribes the usage of the Twitter account, \u201cit is unconstitutional to arrest let alone prosecute anyone for using Twitter\u2019s services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also told THISDAY that the parliament is currently looking into the recent suspension of Twitter by the federal government, with a view of getting a critical analysis before taking a position on the trending issue.\n\nKalu said: \u201dThe House is busy looking into the trending Twitter issue as expected for any federal parliament. It is time for an in-depth critical analysis of the entire picture not yet time for press releases on the issue. But be rest assured, it won\u2019t be long before we make our position known in line with our laws and democratic principles.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer and former National Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, condemned the attempt to prosecute violators of the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAjulo opposed Malami\u2019s position, saying: \u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site in Nigeria, it is imperative to note that the provisions of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution are clear to the effect no one shall be prosecuted for an offence not known to law.\n\n\u201cI have carefully stated the contents of our various penal laws and nowhere is a citizen of the country prohibited from receiving or disseminating information, which is a right guaranteed under Section 39 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOrtom described the suspension of Twitter operations in the country as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nThe governor said the Twitter suspension offered no solution to any of the problems facing the country, as the move was only capable of heightening tensions and fuelling suspicions among Nigerians over the real motives of the federal government.\n\nOrtom, in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, said that suspending Twitter amounted to suppressing freedom of expression, gagging social media and undermining fundamental human rights of Nigerians, a development contravening Chapter four of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nOrtom emphasised the need for the federal government to listen to the views and yearnings of the people to enable it to address the challenges confronting the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives has threatened to sue the federal government in court over the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nIt described the decision as an act of desperation of a non-performing and failed government to intimidate and cow the citizens to consolidate its hold on power by brute force.\n\nThe Leader of the caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said Twitter had become an integral component of the citizens\u2019 ability to keep the government in check and to provide real-time feedback on the impact of the government\u2019s activities on the citizenry.\n\nPDP: APC behind Twitter Suspension, Moves to Suppress Nigerians\n\nThe PDP has accused the National Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP said facts available to it showed how APC leaders at one of their party\u2019s national caucus meetings recommended the regulation of social media in Nigeria and how they have been plotting to obliterate internet-based interaction platforms such as Twitter.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the APC Caucus had been pushing bills in the National Assembly, particularly in November 2020, seeking to enforce a draconian regulation of social media so as to gag Nigerians from exposing its atrocities, including human right abuses, treasury looting, nepotism and sectional marginalisation by the APC administration.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cNigerians can also recall how the APC administration in carrying out the agenda of its party has been using the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to suffocate the media space with humongous fines and threats of suspension of operating licences of broadcast stations.\u201d\n\nBuhari: We Are Taking the Lead in Cyber Policing\n\nProtocols:\n\n1. It is with great pleasure that I address you today on this occasion of the 2019 Annual Investment Meeting here in Dubai.\n\n2. I wish to thank His Royal Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates, for inviting me to speak at this event.\n\n3. This is the ninth edition of such a gathering. At this point, I want to congratulate His Highness, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum for his vision to support such a platform where world leaders in both the public and private sectors exchange ideas on how to make this world a better place.\n\n4. This morning, my brief remarks will be on digital globalisation, which we all agree is transforming the world as we know it. Almost every day, innovations and transformative ideas are rolled out. This trend is here to stay.\n\n5. Today, we have a cyber world that is intangible but real. This borderless world is powerful, and it impacts the lives of billions of people, no matter how remote their physical locations are.\n\n6. People work in it. People socialise in it. And people invest in it. This presents enormous opportunities. But it also remains a constant threat if left unregulated.\n\n7. On the one hand, it has made the human race more productive and more efficient. Today, we have digital banking, virtual currencies and many social platforms that connect people and cultures.\n\n8. On the other hand, we have seen platforms hijacked and manipulated as evidenced by the steady rise in fake news and cybercrimes.\n\n9. More recently, we are also witnessing the use of the cyber space to manipulate elections, subvert the democratic rights of citizens as well as propagate violence.\n\n10. In effect, the digital world has become the new frontier for both good and evil. Therefore, the challenge for world leaders must be to ensure that this space is inclusive, accessible and safe.\n\n11. In Nigeria, our mobile phone penetration exceeds eighty per cent. This means majority of Nigeria\u2019s one hundred and ninety million citizens are fully connected to this new digital world; especially our youth.\n\n12. Sixty five percent or one hundred and seventeen million Nigerians are under the age of 25 years. These bright minds are the drivers of this emerging digital sector.\n\n13. Today, Nigeria has close to ninety technology hubs and every day, new ones are coming up and they are all developing solutions for Nigerian, and indeed global problems.\n\n14. Already, these young entrepreneurs have attracted investments of over one hundred million dollars. A sizeable amount from overseas including Silicon Valley.\n\n15. As many of you from this region are aware, Nigerian start-ups always have a very impressive outing at the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition (GITEX). Many have won prizes.\n\n16. As leaders, it is therefore our responsibility to create the enabling environment for these minds to flourish and reach their full potential.\n\n17. When we came in 2015, we immediately agreed that any future economic growth must be inclusive.\n\n18. As the Nigerian youth population are fully digitalised, it is clear that the idea of having an inclusive economy cannot be achieved without digital inclusion.\n\n19. We therefore leveraged and supported digital platforms in our numerous socio-economic programs: from training extension workers in agriculture, health and education sectors; to enabling micro-credits to increase financial inclusion.\n\n20. However, whilst this digital globalisation has occurred rapidly in the private sector, many governments and regulators have not kept pace.\n\n21. New waves of cybercrime and terrorism continue to threaten the positive strides being made.\n\n22. On cyber security, Nigeria has taken the lead in cyber policing in West Africa. In this, we are working with our regional and global partners.\n\n23. Furthermore, our public sector reform programs focus on digitising key operations. From procurement to payroll to revenue collections, we are using digital platforms to reinforce our objectives of improving efficiency, accountability and transparency in governance.\n\n24. We are also working on creating the largest digital database in Africa. Already, our digital identity system has captured over thirty million Nigerians and legal residents.\n\n25. As earlier observed, the digital world is borderless. In many instances, the criminals in this world are faceless and without physical addresses. This is why we must all come together to protect the good while eliminating the bad.\n\n26. Emerging threats are difficult to prevent or manage unilaterally. It has to be a collective effort, led by both public and private sector leaders \u2013 many of whom are here today.\n\n27. A certain level of regulation is needed to preserve the integrity of the digital economy.\n\n28. I therefore would ask all of us here present, over the coming days, to put our heads together and come up with proposals on how we create a digital world that is accessible, inclusive and safe.\n\n29. I thank you for listening and wish you very successful deliberations.\n\n\u2022Being the text of keynote speech delivered by President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Annual Investment Meeting in Dubai, UAE, on April 8, 2019\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Stakeholders demand legal backing for proscription\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City, James Sowole in Akure, Bassey Inyang in Calabar, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Sylvester Idowu in Warri, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti and Amby Uneze in Owerri\n\nDespite the ban on open grazing of cattle by Southern governors, the practice has continued to flourish in the 17 states of the region with stakeholders asking for legal backing for the proscription order.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigations at the weekend showed that the delay by the governors in enacting laws in their states to legalise the ban has heightened concerns among residents, particularly in the farming communities of the states.\n\nWith the absence of the law, according to THISDAY\u2019s investigations, herders have continued to openly graze their cattle, leading in some cases to frequent clashes between them and farmers whose farmlands suffer devastation due to the movement of the animals.\n\nThe governors, under the aegis of the Southern Nigeria Governors Forum (SNGF), rising from a meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, on May 11, had, among others announced a ban on open grazing to check the escalating conflict between farmers and herders.\n\nHowever, their decision had riled the federal government with President Muhammadu Buhari querying the legality of the ban.\n\nIn Ondo State, THISDAY gathered that the Bill against Open Grazing and other Matters Related has passed through the second reading but the lawmakers couldn\u2019t go further in the legislative process due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nBut open grazing by herders has reduced drastically in the state, particularly in places close to urban areas.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the herders still move their cows in many villages like Osi, Ogbese, Ala, Igbatoro, Eleyowo and other villages in Akure North Local Government Area.\n\nAlso, sources told THISDAY that the practice is still going on in villages in Ondo North but not with the impunity earlier displayed by herders.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Commander of the Ondo State Security Network, Amotekun, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said open grazing had reduced in the state as the security agency no longer give them chances to continue the illegal practice.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, thinking that we would not have some herders still engaging in open grazing in view of the ban and the operation of Amotekun is like saying why do we still have crime when there are policemen working?\n\n\u201cOndo State Government through Amotekun is not relenting. The herders know they are doing the wrong thing. Once they see us, they run away. They know they are doing the wrong thing destroying some people\u2019s means of livelihood for yours to thrive, we see it as being unfair.\n\n\u201cThe position of government is very clear about it. No open grazing is no open grazing, and anybody that is engaging in it is doing illegal thing and anybody that is caught, will face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nIn Cross River State, the herders were still practising open grazing as usual in some communities in Odukpani, Obanliku, Yala, Yakurr, and Obubra Local Government Areas.\n\nHowever, THISDAY gathered that there have been no clashes between the herders and any of the communities since the cows are restricted to the areas where they have been grazing for decades.\n\n\u201cThe owners of the cows pay rent to the community for the space the cows are taken to feed in the bush along Calabar-Itu highway. That is how we have been operating with them for years, and there is no problem; we have never heard problems,\u201d a community leader from Okoyong confided in THISDAY.\n\nHowever, the state government is insisting that it will not go it alone, but would wait for the southern governors to work out modalities on the way forward.\n\nPress Secretary to the Cross River State Governor, Mr. Christian Ita, said grazing in restricted area was not strange to the state having established the first cattle ranch in Nigeria; the Obudu Cattle Ranch Resort.\n\n\u201cAs I said, I am sure modalities would be worked out at the Southern governors\u2019 level, and then we proceed from there,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Anambra State, despite the ban on open grazing, herdsmen still graze cattle in communities in the state, even within the state capital territory, in open fields and on farms belonging to farmers.\n\nMr. Fredrick Okoye, a farmer in Umuokpu community, Awka South Local Government Area, told THISDAY that despite the ban on open grazing, Fulani herdsmen still graze their cattle on their farms, damaging their crops daily.\n\n\u201cThere is a law which states that if Fulani people destroy your crop, they will pay you for it, and if farmers kill cattle, the farmer will pay for it. But to tell you the truth, that arrangement has not been working. If they (herders) destroy your farm, they don\u2019t pay. If you kill their cattle, they also do not even report for payment, rather, they think of a reprisal.\n\n\u201cThat is the major reason we are afraid. They graze on our fields everyday, even today. If you come to Umuokpu today and wait until afternoon, you will see them,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Okpuno and Mgbakwu communities, all around the state capital, cattle were seen in the area, grazing in open fields.\n\nThere have been cases of clashes between herdsmen and farmers in Anaku, Omor and even in riverrine parts of Anambra State.\n\nAnambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba, said the anti-open grazing law was unnecessary as the proclamation of the ban by the governors was enough for the herders to comply.\n\nThe Speaker, Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Marcus Onobu, also told THISDAY that the persistent open grazing of cattle in the state was due to the inability of the state government to come up with legislation against it.\n\nOnobus said Governor Godwin Obaseki was yet to come up with a bill to legalise open grazing.\n\nHe added that though a private bill against open grazing exists, the legislature was yet to debate it because it requires public hearing.\n\n\u201cBut I think the major problem is the strike action by legislative workers because already, we have a private bill before us.\n\n\u201cEven if we want to rely on the private bill without waiting for the governor, we are still going to have a public hearing, and we cannot do that since the legislative workers\u2019 strike has not been called off,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, without a legislation, it will be difficult to enforce the ban on open grazing as verbal pronouncement is not enough because aggrieved persons can go to court to seek redress.\n\nIn Delta State, open grazing persists in the forest, particularly in Ughelli, Abraka, Oghara in Delta South and Central Senatorial zones.\n\nHowever, security arrangement and agitations by the people have reduced open grazing.\n\nMr. Olisa Ifeajika, Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, confirmed to THISDAY that there has been a reduction in open grazing in the state.\n\nIfeajika said the state was yet to enact a law against open grazing due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nDespite the anti-open grazing law in Oyo State, herders are still openly grazing their cattle in most areas of the state.\n\nAreas where open grazing is still going on in the state include Ibarapaland, Oyo/Ogbomoso expressway, Oke Ogun and some parts of Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nThe state House of Assembly in October 2019 passed a bill titled, \u2018Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Law\u2019, which was signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nHowever, Makinde has expressed the determination of his administration to enforce the law, stating that the state government will within the next eight weeks launch a task force to enforce the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Oyo State, open grazing is against the law. The implementation plan will come out within the next six to eight weeks and the task force will cut across Oyo State. So, whoever goes against the law in this state will face the wrath of law and that is just it.\u201d\n\nMakinde\u2019s Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Taiwo Adisa, while speaking on the challenges facing the implementation of the law, identified the major one as the lack of commitment of the police and other security agencies to enforce the law.\n\nFarmers operating in Ekiti State have also raised the alarm that open grazing of cattle and other ruminant animals are still happening in all the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\nSome farmers told THISDAY in Oke Ako, Irele and Ipao in Ikole Local Government Areas and Ijan and Aisegba in Gbonyin Local Government area as well as Aaye Oja, Igogo and Osan in Moba Council Area that the practice was still effective in their areas.\n\nTHISDAY observed that the practice was even common in Ado Ekiti, the capital city, especially along Ado-Ijan-Ikare, Ado-Iworoko-Ifaki and Ado-Ikere-Akure roads.\n\nHowever, the State Commander of Ekiti State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe (rtd), said the law was being vigorously enforced by the security outfit.\n\nHe said the outfit had been zealous in the enforcement of ban on open grazing of cattle, adding that some herders and cattle had been arrested with owners already in court facing charges while their cows were confiscated.\n\nAkomolafe added that his officers had engaged in shootout with some herders around 2:00am on more than four occasions around Ikole axis, which he said attested to the proactiveness of Amotekun to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our statutory duties to enforce the law and we are doing it. We have arrested scores of cattle owners who are in court facing charges but their cases got stalled by JUSUN\u2019s strike. Some are still being detained by the police.\n\n\u201cWe know that some herders are still disobeying this law, but we are extending our dragnets against them. Even most of them who are returning to the North due to the advent of rain used to take permission from us and we took pain to escort them to the border in Kwara or Kogi to ensure that no destruction takes place,\u201d he added..\n\nThe ban on open cattle grazing was yet to be enforced in Imo State.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Imo State Government has so far not send any anti-open grazing bill to the House of Assembly.\n\nAt the moment, herdsmen are still seen in the bushes and by the road sides grazing their cattle without anybody or security personnel challenging them.\n\nEven in the Owerri, the capital city, as well as in other various villages and communities, open grazing still goes on unchecked.\n\nAreas where the herdsmen usually go for grazing include Irette, Avu, Obinze, in Owerri West LGA; Emekuku, Agbala, Amakohia/Akwakuma in Owerri North LGA.\n\nOther areas are Obowo, Okigwe, Mbaise, and other Local government areas.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The banks also agreed to operate something akin to foreign exchange imprest account such that the coffers of banks will be replenished so long as they retire the initial amounts to the satisfaction of the CBN.\u201d\n\nNwanisobi allayed fears of a forex shortage and urged members of the public seeking to purchase foreign exchange for PTA, BTA, payment of tuition fees or medical fees to do so from their banks.\n\n\u201cWe wish to assure members of the public that the CBN shall continue to monitor market developments and is committed to ensuring an efficient FX market for all legitimate users,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, advised customers to approach their customer service representatives of their designated banks should they encounter challenges, adding that they could escalate complaints to the CBN via the bank\u2019s toll-free line: 07002255226 or send an email to cpd@cbn.gov.ng if their requests are not met.\n\nSources at the meeting with the bank CEOs held to address the challenge faced by customers in accessing forex from their banks, said Emefiele warned that the CBN would deal with any bank that denies customers the opportunity to purchase foreign exchange for legitimate purposes.\n\nAccording to the source, Emefiele said the CBN management frowned upon the seeming difficulty customers experienced in accessing foreign exchange through the banks, particularly for Invisibles such as PTA and requests bordering on tuition and healthcare needs.\n\nEmefiele had last week reiterated the bank\u2019s commitment to ensuring steady availability of foreign exchange for manufacturers.\n\nEmefiele had also urged banks as well as Nigerians to strive to end environmental pollution and ensure sustenance of banking principles.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chiemelie Ezeobi, Segun James, Mary Nnah, Sunday Ehigiator in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha in Abuja, James Sowole in Akure and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday led other dignitaries, including former President Goodluck Jonathan, and Governors Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, to mourn the founder of The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Pastor Temitope Balogun Joshua.\n\nA statement by the SCOAN said the televangelist died on Saturday. He was 57 years old.\n\nThe statement did not give the cause of his death.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday 5th June 2021, Prophet TB Joshua spoke during the Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting: \u201cTime for everything \u2013 time to come here for prayer and time to return home after the service.\n\n\u201cGod has taken His servant, Prophet TB Joshua home \u2013 as it should be by divine will. His last moments on earth were spent in the service of God. This is what he was born for, lived for and died for,\u201d the church said.\n\nThe news of the death of Joshua was met with shock and disbelief. When THISDAY arrived at the church\u2019s headquarters in Ikotun-Egbe, a suburb of Lagos, members were looking forlorn while some were crying profusely asking church workers to disprove the story.\n\nEfforts to access the church was rebuffed by officials who blocked the entrance and denied even members entrance.\n\nFor most of those present, nothing could be more shocking as they had no inkling what was in the offing when they thronged the church yesterday seeking solutions to their problems.\n\nThe road to the church was equally crowded with people who were prevented from entering the church, among whom were those that came with the hopes of being healed of one illness or the other by the late televangelist.\n\nBuhari, in a statement yesterday by his media adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, said Joshua would be missed by his global followers.\n\nHe commiserated with the family and members of SCOAN on the passing on of their father and founder.\n\nHe said the renowned televangelist would be missed by his followers all over the world not only for his spiritual contributions, but for touching many lives through philanthropic gestures.\n\nHe urged Joshua\u2019s followers to take solace in the knowledge that life is not measured and defined by chronological longevity but by enduring legacies and lives touched positively.\n\nHe also condoled with the government and people of Ondo State.\n\nJonathan expressed sadness over the death of Joshua, describing him as a devout man of God.\n\nIn a message of condolence to his family and the SCOAN congregation, the former president said Joshua served God and humanity with passion.\n\nJonathan also prayed God to grant his followers across the world the strength to cope with his exit.\n\n\u201cI am saddened to hear about the death of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua known as TB Joshua, the Spiritual Leader of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), at a young age of 57.\n\n\u201cTB Joshua was a devout man of God who served God and humanity with relentless passion. He was a man of sound doctrine, meek and faithful to his call and passion of reconciling men to God and offering hope to humanity.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian leader, TB Joshua and his ministry exemplified Christ in faith, love and charity; positively impacting the lives of many Nigerians, Africans and millions of people across the world,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Akeredolu said he received the news of the death of Joshua with a heavy heart.\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Richard Olatunde, described the deceased as a blessing to humanity and a great ambassador of the state.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Pastor Joshua\u2019s demise came as a rude shock. The pains are not mere emotional flashes; they are indeed piercing. The Ondo-born Pastor and televangelist was a philanthropist whose exit will be sorely missed by many,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso in a statement, the traditional ruler of Joshua\u2019s hometown, the Zaki of Arigidi, Oba Tisa Olanipekun, said the community received the sad news with grieving hearts.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe shocking event is reported to have occurred on Saturday, 5th June, following a prayer and worship session at his church. His body is believed to have been deposited in a morgue somewhere around the church. A delegation from SCOAN is presently headed for Arigidi to make an announcement and submit a factual report of the devastating incident.\n\n\u201cPending receipt and confirmation of this report, I solicit the full co-operation of SCOAN church members in Nigeria and across the globe to allow the immediate family and the Arigidi community to mourn this painful loss without further distractions.\n\n\u201cI am hereby making a demand that his body must be preserved intact until arrangements are made to examine and/or certify the cause of his death and the body is moved to Arigidi for final burial rights to be announced at a later date.\u201d\n\nFayemi has also expressed condolences on the death of Joshua.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, said he received the news of Joshua\u2019s death as a rude shock, describing it as a major blow to the Christian community in the country.\n\nFayemi described the deceased as a man of God whose life and ministry impacted positively on the lives of the people.\n\nHe added that the uniqueness of his ministry also earned him large followership outside the country.\n\nThe governor said the late Joshua did not only minister to the spiritual needs of the people but to their physical and financial needs as attested to by many who found succour in his church.\n\nAlso, the Southern Senators\u2019 Forum has described the demise of the renowned preacher as a national loss.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by the Chairman of the forum, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, the lawmakers said Joshua\u2019s evangelistic and philanthropic gesture had inscribed his name in gold.\n\nThe forum said Joshua spent over four decades serving God and that he had only answered the call to get his reward for these sacrifices in heaven.\n\nOn his part, the Aare Oona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, described the death of Joshua as an eclipse in God\u2019s vineyard, saying it is a rude shock.\n\nAdams, who is a cousin of the church leader, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, said Joshua was an Iroko tree, an abode for many souls.\n\n\u201cThe man of God has found favour in spreading the Gospel of God through his ministry. And according to the words of God from the Bible \u201cThe Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult for me to come to terms with the reality of his death. It was a rude shock and very sad. Prophet TB Joshua lived and died for God. His life was a complete definition of God\u2019s generosity and philosophy. He was very humble, gentle and generous to a fault. His large-heartedness knows no tribe, colour, ethnic, language or religion. He was simply a winner of souls even spreading beyond the shores of Nigeria,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Twitter ban rewinds Nigeria to pre-internet darkness and reign of fear",
          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is its citizens\u2019 use of Twitter, and all media enabled by the internet.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought the country had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

          "text": "Twitter has reacted to the indefinite suspension of the social media site by the Nigerian government, expressing concern.\n\nA statement by a Twitter spokesperson to TechCabal said:\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "text": "On behalf of the ownership of Farmsponsor Nig Ltd, we want to thank our sponsors for their unwavering support and trusting us as we work to improve the Agricultural sector in Nigeria.\n\nWe deeply share in your displeasure with the upset that the company has had in paying out its sponsors.\n\nThe past few days has been quite a challenge as the company has been facing some difficulties which has destabilized our crowd funding operations.\n\nThese challenge stems from the recent SEC cease announcement on all crowdfunding platforms by June 30, 2021. This has made it impractical for Farm-sponsor to continue its crowding operation as the notice came upon us abruptly, by the first week of June.\n\nWe are taking appropriate measures to see that all funds collected from every sponsor will be paid back accordingly.\n\n\n\nAn overview of Farmsponsor facilities and operational layout\n\nPlease bear with us as payments will likely be staggered. We are working to make payout as fast as possible but to be honest, it may take up to 18 \u2013 24 months to finish. Paying everyone at once will eat too deep into our operational cash flow. Let us continue to work to pay you.\n\nThe stated timeline is only but the very least. We are already working hard to see everyone is paid in the shortest of time, nevertheless we wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint twice so we have to settle for the stated projected timeframe.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that over the last two years, Farm-sponsor have accomplished a great deal, and we owe it to all your sponsorship.\n\nIn the time that we have been doing business together along with the funds you have trusted us with, we have been able to establish the following:\n\n\u2022 A 360,000-broiler Pen (biggest in South-South Nigeria).\n\n\u2022 60,000 capacity breeders pen (with over 10,000 laying breeder birds).\n\n\u2022 10 tons per hour feed mill.\n\n\u2022 24,000 per day fully automated chicken processing plant (recently installed and commissioned).\n\n\u2022 128,000 birds per week state of the art hatchery.\n\n\u2022 823 Hectares of land in Oyo State (valued above $3m).\n\n\u2022 A veterinary clinic and two retail supermarket outlets in the heart of Port Harcourt, amongst many other great features that we have achieved together.\n\nWe are just stating to make certain, perhaps you\u2019re in doubt that you have invested wisely.\n\nPart of our short term strategies is through overdraft or a term loan from some of our financial institutions. Our mid term strategy is through equity investment from institutional investors and we are willing to relinquish 30-50% of directors shares in the company. Our long term strategy would be direct revenue from the business, hence the 18-24 months.\n\nOur entire workforce is working tirelessly to ensure that we regain the trust you\u2019ve always had with Farmsponsor.\n\nIt\u2019s uneasy on our part that we are writing this letter instead of payment slips.\n\nWe apologize for any undue hardship or inconveniences that this might cause you.\n\nWe really appreciate your understanding, and support as well as believing in us as we walk this journey of emerging a stronger Farm-sponsor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAkpa Chike\n\nCo-founder, Globetrot Farmsponsor Nig Ltd.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nMigration is the movement of persons from their place of usual residence and across international borders to a country of which they are not national, usually for the benefit of all \u2013 country of destination and country of origin.\n\nSuch movement which are due to different factors could be immidiate or remote and could regular or irregular.\n\nIrregular migration is that movement which takes place outside the regulatory norms of the sending, transit and destination country. Those who migrate are call migrants.\n\nA migrants is any person who is moving or has moved across international borders or within a state, away from his/her habitual place of residence, regardless of the person\u2019s legal status, cause (s) of the movement and whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary.\n\nRecently, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) organised a training programme for selected journalists in the print, radio, television and digital media spread across different states of Nigeria.\n\nThis was within the framework and understanding of the role of the media in information dissemination\n\nThe three days training held in the FCT, Abuja was part of IOM awareness raising interventions designed to create positive behavioral change among potential migrants, their families and friends to make safe and informed migration related decisions and promote the positive impact returning migrants bring to their home communities.\n\nBeyond awareness raising, the training was aimed at building the capacity of participants in providing legal, ethical and well informed migration related reporting, with focus on data analysis and reporting, migration and challenges of COVID-19, interviewing migrants and their families, especially vulnerable migrants, social media, migration and technology, migration terminologies, human rights, mental health psychosocial support in reporting, gender and migration, as well as working with editors in migration reporting, among others.\n\nIt was also aimed at equipping them with the requisite knowledge to adequately situate migration related matters in the public domain, besides being a platform to strengthen existing partnership between IOM and the media organisations.\n\nAlso, in line with the concept of bridging capacity gap in reporting on migration, the Civil Society Network on Migration and Development (CSOnetMADE) organised a 2-day Capacity Building Workshop for Media Agencies on Migration Reportage in the South-South region of Nigeria.\n\nIt was a follow up to a similar one in the South-East and North-West, with a prospect of another in the North-Central.\n\nIt was in recognition of the fact that in the context of migration, the media are crucial in delivering verified information, informed opinion, as well as balanced and incisive narrative.\n\nCSOnetMADE believes that the madia contribute and shape public, political perception on all aspects of life, including migration.\n\nFor instance, such perception portrays migration as a problem, rather than a multi-faceted global phenomenon, with a variety of challenges and opportunities.\n\nNowadays, migration is largely illustrated by scenes of boat crowded with migrants risking their lives to reach Europe.\n\nIt believes that the media reportage and use of concepts in reporting these scenario have not always been done with appropriate terminologies and understanding of the core migration concern, a development which presented some challenges for policy makers and service providers to effectively respond to the situation.\n\nThe fundamental questions that arose from the 2-day workshop were, how are\n\nmigration issues reported and documented by Nigerian media? How do the media portray migrants and migration? Are madiamen/women properly trained and equipped to report migration related matters?\n\nTo CSOnetMADE, \u201cIt is imperative for the media to understand migration issues if they, as relevant stakeholder of the Nigeria migration management mechanism must add value to migration governance and awareness creation on regular and irregular migration.\u201d\n\nFew days later, IOM organised a Town Hall meeting with key stakeholders for the purpose of establishing ways and links on how to integrate migration discussions in schools so as to bring about increased knowledge and awareness on the risk of irregular migration, human trafficking and smuggling of migrants.\n\nIt was also meant to promote the tenets of safe migration practices, as well as provide avenue for social cohesion for returned migrants to reduce stigma and help them reintegrate into the society.\n\nThe key stakeholders included the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Edo State Ministry of Education, Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Private School Owners Association and the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).\n\nTown Hall meeting is one of the numerous avenues through which Migrants as Messengers (MaM), a project facilitated by IOM engages key stakeholders in communities to proffer solutions aimed at addressing the challenges of migration.\n\nMaM is a migrants centered approach to awareness raising \u2013 giving returned migrants opportunity to share their experiences, with IOM providing the platform.\n\nIt is a peer to peer awareness raising campaign through volunteer returned migrants to empower young people in Nigeria and some other West Africa countries to make informed decisions.\n\nTown Hall meeting also provide a platform for returned migrants to showcase their contributions toward addressing irregular migration by promoting safe and orderly migration, as well as sharing experiences and information as to opportunities in their home communities.\n\nThe move by IOM, though novel, is a demonstration of commitment to working with different cadre of journalists in promoting safe migration, telling stories of returnees and the benefits of migration without prejudice to the fact that migration also has its negative side.\n\nAs the United Nations Migration Agency, IOM in collaboration with other stakeholders between April 2017 and January 2021 facilitated the voluntary return of 17,359 Nigerians migrants from 22 countries, including Libya, Niger, Mali and other transit/destination countries.\n\nThe figure is made up of 10,141 males and 7,218 females. A further breakdown of the figure indicated that 12,667 returnees were between the 18 and 35 years; 2,436 were between 36 and 45 years; 1,640 were between 0 and 12 years; 363 were between 46 and 53 years; 153 were between 13 and 17 years while 100 were between 54 and 66 years.\n\nOf the total figure, Edo State has the highest figure of 38.1 percent, followed by Delta, 22.6 percent and Ogun State with 6 percent.\n\nThey were provided with immidiate protection and reintegration under the EU-IOM Initiative for Migrants Protection and Reintegration.\n\nIOM also act with its partners in the International and local communities to assist in meeting operational challenges of migration, advance understanding of migration issues as well as encourage social and economic development.\n\nHowever, since 2001 when IOM began operation, it has been in the vanguard of, not only promoting safe migration, it has also assisted migrants find meaning in life.\n\nThrough behavioral Change Communication (BCC) campaigns, outreaches, media reports, IOM seeks to equip vulnerable migrants with the information they need to migrate safely and access assistance when necessary, hence the setting up of three Migrants Resource Centre, each in Abuja, Lagos and Benin City in Edo State.\n\nThe centers offer free information services on migration options to empower potential Nigerian Labour Migrants make informed decisions.\n\nIOM offers Technical Support for the implementation of Labour Migration policy Action Plan which aims at managing labour migration and mobilising diaspora for international development.\n\nIt helped review the National Labour Migration Policy and the National Policy on Migration to ensure that emerging migration issues were well captured and facilitated the high level meeting that led to the adoption of draft and final policies.\n\nIOM aims to address the root causes of vulnerability to trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants through engagement with the media and targeted interventions at the individual, household, commmunity and structural levels.\n\nFor instance, it provides mental health psychosocial support and counseling, not only to returned migrants, but to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).\n\nMore often than not, the most vulnerable get additional support through reintegration assistance.\n\nA case in point is one Sandra (not real name), an AVR after four years harrowing experience in Libya courtesy of IoM presently operates an hair dressing saloon in the outskirt of Benin City.\n\nShe disclosed to this writer that barely few months after her return, not been able to integrate speedily and in what seems to her as IoM delay in assisting her with empowerment tools, set out to return to Libya, but for the later and timely intervention by IoM with empowerment tools worth over #800,000.\n\nToday, she operates a thriving hair dressing saloon.\n\nAVR (Assisted Voluntary Returnee) include those who traveled for economic reasons, unaccompanied children and survivors of trafficking. IoM assist them with travel logistics and flights. Many receive protection support as well.\n\nOver the years, and based on partnership, IoM has supported efforts of Nigeria government to manage migration, while strong collaboration has established with stakeholders on migration, both nationally and internationally in order to enhance border management, fight human trafficking, reduce irregular migration and mainstream migration policy decisions.\n\nIts migration policy based research contributes to evidenced-based policies on migration that address the needs of migrants and supports the national capacity to address them.\n\nAs at today, IOM is a reputed UN agency that promotes migration policies and legislation which are coherent, comprehensive and in line with national realities and which correspond to international norms and good practices.\n\nIt is a leading and accredited inter-governmental organisation working with migrants and government to respond to contemporary migration challenges. It is well positioned to build on its grassroots experience and provide guidance on migration policy. It provides information, advice and support to further the efforts of its stakeholders to develop effective national, regional and global migration management policies and strategies, as well as contributes to increased dialogue between migration stakeholders at bilateral, regional and global levels.\n\n...",

It is, therefore, incumbent on all lovers of peace and freedom to rise against this current regression into savagery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe on our part are resolved to defend our people, their property, and all legitimate means of livelihood against both internal and external aggression. On this, there will be no compromise. We call on our people to remain vigilant and report any suspicious movement in their communities. In addition, they must be united in the task of defending our lives and properties. We cannot afford to fail,\u201d he said.\n\nThe killing has also been condemned by many Nigerians including the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams.\n\n\u201cThis is one killing too many, I will not fold my arms seeing the blood of innocent people being shed like it is in Igangan,\u201d Mr Adams said in his statement.\n\nThe attack on Igangan comes months after a self-acclaimed activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, led a crowd to Igangan to eject the head of the Fulani community there, Salihu Abdulkadir.\n\nHe accused Mr Abdulkadir of backing criminal herdsmen whom he alleged were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of farmers and residents of the community. Mr Abdulkadir denied the allegation but he was nonetheless forcefully ejected from a community he had lived in for decades.\n\nThe federal and Oyo State governments frowned at the development, saying no citizen has the right to eject other citizens from wherever they wished to reside in the country.\n\nIgangan residents said on Sunday that they believe the latest attack was a retaliation for the eviction of Mr Abdulkadir.\n\nAPC calls for security summit\n\nThe main opposition party in Oyo State, APC, in its reaction to the attack, called on Governor Seyi Makinde to convene a security summit promptly to address the security challenges in the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cObviously and certainly, the current situation of Oyo State was not what Makinde and PDP took over from the immediate past APC government in the state under Governor Abiola Ajimobi in 2019,\u201d the Oyo APC spokesperson, AbdulAzeez Olatunde, said.\n\n\u201cThe excuse of general security issues has been with us in Nigeria since 2009 even before Ajimobi took over the mantle of governance in 2011. In spite of the issues, Ajimobi secured Oyo State,\u201d it said.\n\nThe APC also asked the governor to make public how much he had spent so far on the state\u2019s monthly security.",

          "title": "Anxiety as extrajudicial killings in S/East escalates",
          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nA window into the level and the dynamics of Insecurity, anxiety and extrajudicial killings in the southeast were three telling incidents of great significance in the last two weeks have occurred in that zone of the country: one, the killing of Ahmed Gulak, an APC chieftain and former Special Adviser to president Goodluck Jonathan, the ongoing army operations where many youth have allegedly been labelled IPOB militants and sympathisers, according to media reports, and were executed by soldiers, the other was an unfortunate incident close to Onitsha bridge by Anambra state\u2019s side.\n\nGun-wielding troops of the Nigerian army had mounted various check points causing heavy traffic gridlocks that verged total standstill.\n\nAs a salon car approached and was flagged down by the soldiers, the occupants, suspected to be IPOB militants opened fire on five soldiers at the checkpoint, instantly killing all of them .\n\nIn its bid to solve a growing regional crisis, Nigeria\u2019s government may have made it worse, again.\n\nNot too long ago, a group,\n\nCoalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) accused the military of extra judicial killings of youths in the zone. The accusation was contained in a statement issued three weeks ago by the President-General, GoodluckIbem, and Secretary-General, KaniceIgwe.\n\nIt cited the alleged shooting to death of Owerri-based businessman, Noel Chigbu, by a soldier at a checkpoint in Amakohia, Owerri, on Friday, April 30, 2021 by 10p.m., among other killings.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cCOSEYL, the umbrella body of all youth organisations in the South East geopolitical zone, is very enraged over the unlawful, barbaric, wicked and extra-judicial killing of a businessman, Mr. Noel Chigbu, aged 39 years, by the military at Amakohia junction, Owerri, Imo State for allegedly violating their checkpoint rule. Another is the unlawful killing of a first-year student, Divine Nwaneri, at a military checkpoint close to Imo Governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThese killings and more that happened in recent times are tangible proof that the military are on a secret mission to exterminate Igbo youths in the South East. The killing of unarmed agitators and pampering of Boko Haram terrorists is a clear testament that Ndigbo have been marked for extinction by the Nigerian military.\u201d\n\nIt wondered why the soldiers paid with tax-payers money would kill an innocent youth on the flimsy excuse of violating checkpoint rules. COSEYL stated: \u201cThis is absolute madness and it must stop forthwith.\n\nUrging the soldiers to desist from harassing the Igbo people, the coalition added: \u201cThe impunity with which soldiers and other security operatives deal with Igbo youths calls for serious concern. This is total harassment of Ndigbo and we reject it in its entirety.\n\n\u201cIgbo youths are being arrested by the army who brand them unknown gunmen and kill them. How do they know that they are unknown gunmen?\u201dIt called on governors, lawmakers and other political office holders from the South East to speak up in defence of their people, who are being unlawfully killed daily without justifiable reasons.\n\n\u201cIf our governors and other political office holders are keeping silent and all Igbo youths are killed, who will vote for them in the next elections?\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, demand that the military must identify and hand over those soldiers involved in the unlawful killings of Chigbu, Nwaneri and others to the police for immediate prosecution\n\nFor months, the revival of age-long secessionist rhetoric for the creation of a \u201cBiafra\u201d nation for the Igbo ethnic group has grown in popularity across Nigeria\u2019s southeast.\n\nMany attribute this revival to Buhari\u2019s exclusive government, ethnic jingoism, tribalism which seems to favour the Fulani ethnic stock of the president to the exclusion of other nationalities in key appointments and the impunity of Fulani herdsmen and their pampering by the authorities, even when it is evident that innocent Nigerian are killed,kidnapped and raped by some of these herders.\n\nThe secessionist calls have been mainly led by NnamdiKanu, the self-declared leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Kanu, a British citizen who started his protests from London, was previously known only by his dedicated followers in the region, but has now grown popular with tacit support from other nationalities outside the southeast on account of what many see as the righteousness of his legitimate demand.\n\nKanu was again at the center of growing tensions in the southeast this week as, he asked the people of the region to observe stay-at- home order on 30th to 31th May .\n\nIn a show of force, the Nigerian government deployed army troops to southeast . Of recent, many Security personnel, especially police have been killed in the region by gun men, according to the authorities, IPOB members are behind the spate of violence, killings and arson on public utilities, but the organization has vehemently denied responsibility for these crimes.\n\nNot helping matters are videos on social media showing soldiers\u2019 inhumane treatment of local youth in the southeast and chasing after unarmed civilians in trucks. Inadvertently, the army\u2019s actions have stoked increased tensions between southeast Igbos and the northerners.\n\nHistorically, Igbos in Nigeria\u2019s southeast have felt marginalized in Nigeria and president Buhari, a northerner, did little to ease those sentiments soon after taking office when he suggested he\u2019d prioritize development in other regions where he won more votes.\n\nThe animosity between the regions had progressively worsened over the years.\n\nIn June 2017, a coalition of northern youth groups issued Igbos living in the north with a quit notice. At the time, the Nigeria government urged Igbos to disregard the threat and promised to apprehend the youth group\u2019s leaders but no one was arrested in connection with the quit notice.\n\nIn the aftermath of clashes the army has declared IPOB a terrorist organization. It cited the group\u2019s formation of Biafran law enforcement bodies and \u201cpossession and use of weapons.\u201d\n\nThe fallout of the events of the past days is still unclear but already, gun men have routinely killed many police officers and soldiers in the region.\n\nThe latest build up of troops and the guerilla tactics employed by IPOB members in responding to army violence have been stoking fears of a breakout of violence.\n\nIn response to a gradual move towards anarchy and killing of security personnel, the Buhari government has launched Operation Restore Peace, designed to destroy the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a separatist group in support of independence for the former breakaway Republic of Biafra, and its security wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nAccording to Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, the security services are not to be constrained by human rights considerations. In comments reported in the Nigerian media, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t mind the media shout; do the job I command you. If anyone accuses you of human rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So, take the battle to them wherever they are and kill them all. Don\u2019t wait for an order.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat another order are you waiting for when Mr. President had ordered you to shoot anybody carrying AK-47 rifle? Quote me, even a dead policeman can be tried and dismissed from the force and his family will not get his benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t sit and wait for them to come; take attack to them and don\u2019t lose your arms to criminals.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the IGP is not only giving the green light to human rights violations, but also promising his protection for those who commit them. In addition, he is threatening those who might hang back with the loss of pension benefits! Usman is implying that he has the full support of President MuhammaduBuhari\u201d, declared professor AdeagboMoritiwon, a political scientist. The professor said this posturing is yet another sign of Buhari\u2019s lack of empathy and sensitivity. He said in a situation like this, the president ought to have made a conciliatory nation-wide broadcast to douse tension and sue for peace.\n\nBusiness Hallmark learnt that security services are conducting house-to-house searches in Ebonyi, Imo, and Rivers states, all with large Igbo populations. Local people are saying that the security services are rounding up young men and their family members and taking them away for questioning. IPOB leader NnamdiKanu has dubbed the police initiative \u201cOperation Massacre Biafrans.\u201d\n\nAs it is now, youth and even other people are living in fear, not knowing what will happen. This fear had led to panic buying of foodstuffs, in case the face -off between IPOB and security forces are in for a long haul.\n\nShops and offices have remained under locks and key in the southeast, and feelers show that banks may join for fear of attacks and violence.\n\nThe inspector general of police shot- on- sight order have scared the daylight out of people and have chosen to remain indoors for the time being.\n\n\u201cUsman Baba is a northern Muslim from Yobe State. He is a career police officer. There is nothing in his background that would suggest an understanding of southern and eastern grievances and fears of the \u201cestablishment of a Fulani Caliphate\u201d, said a top politician from the southeast who pleaded anonymity.\n\nOperation Restore Peace and Baba\u2019s rhetoric would seem tailor-made to feed the revived Biafra secessionist movement and general southern and Christian fears of a Fulani-Muslim onslaught against Christians.\n\nMoritiwon said,\u201d it should be anticipated that local people will fight back viciously and the security services\u2014as directed by Usman Baba\u2014will respond in kind. It is to be hoped that President Buhari will repudiate Baba\u2019s rhetoric and methods, not least for the sake of the unity of Nigeria.\n\nOnly last week, seven suspected persons were killed when the Nigerian troops from 6 Division Garrison, Port Harcourt and 29 Battalion in conjunction with operatives of Nigerian Police, DSS, and NSCDC raided an operational base of the Eastern Security Network, an armed arm of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra.\n\nThe raid was said to have been carried out on Thursday, 27 May 2021 on the base located at Agbomchia Forest along Pipeline Road Ogali/Komkom Boundary between Eleme and Oyigbo LGAs of Rivers State, army spokesman Mohammed Yerima said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIn the firefight that ensued during the Clearance/Raid Operation, 7 IPOB/ESN members were neutralized.\n\nMeanwhile, The World Igbo Congress (WIC) has viewed, with a sense of foreboding, the reported \u201cshoot-on-sight\u201d order given to Nigerian Army units operating in the southeastern states ostensibly to check the activities of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its Public Relations Officer, Basil Onwukwe, yesterday, said: \u201cThe said order further exacerbates the perplexing inability of the Nigerian forces to issue and/or execute similar orders against the deadly Boko Haram and marauding Fulani bandits, euphemistically called Fulani herdsmen, who have ramped up their terror activities against Nigeria since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe order further compounds our consternation over the posting of soldiers of Igbo descent to the hotbeds of terror in Boko Haram over-run territories while posting only Fulani soldiers to the South-East.\n\n\u201cBy all estimations, IPOB is simply an unarmed organisation.\n\nNigerian governments have a long history of worsening potential crises through a highhanded approach. In Dec. 2015, the Buhari-led government was accused of killing hundreds of members of Islamic Movement of Nigeria, a Shiite group in Nigeria\u2019s north, leading to fears of another insurgency in the north. The Nigerian army claimed the group prompted a confrontation after blocking the motorcade of Nigeria\u2019s army chief. Despite a court order for his release by courts, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, the leader of the Shiite group, remains in government detention.",

          "title": "Nigerians groan as cost of living soars to record high",
          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nIt is as if Nigerians are presently living in the proverbial Dante\u2019s Inferno, the hottest part of hell reserved for serious, unrepentant sinners whose sins have gone beyond redemption.\n\nSuch is life in today\u2019s Nigeria; and indeed so tough and difficult has life become that eking out a living has become like the Twelve Labours of Hercules.\n\nNigerians from all walks of life, all strata of society, complain of high cost of foodstuff, that electricity bills have reached the rooftops, and also that transportation cost is hurting, while prices of essential products as toiletries and beverages have equally shot up.\n\nIn the face of this is inflation amidst lack of increment of income. For months, Nigerians have been lamenting a steady increase in prices of goods and services.\n\nIn Lagos, as in other major cities, in the country, prices of goods have increased drastically with residents and traders blaming President Muhammadu Buhari for not doing enough to check rising food prices.\n\nIn his view, John Ojo, an artisan opines that the core factor behind the rising food inflation in the country is the heinous activities of the criminally minded among and amidst the rampaging Fulani herdsmen who kill farmers at will and with searing impunity, after destroying their farmlands.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk of soaring prices of food items they should know that incidentally, Buhari\u2019s kinsmen, the Fulani herdsmen, are responsible\u201d, he said in a chat with Business Hallmark.\n\nWhen Business Hallmark visited the Oshodi market, traders ruefully complained of rising prices of goods on a daily basis, while they lament that the President seems to be looking the other way even as Nigerians groan, cry and complain about the high cost of living.\n\nA trader, SherifatAdemuloye who sells provisions and groceries in the market, said: \u201cBuhari knows what he is doing. He literally wants to punish us for voting for him. This is hell on earth.He knows the solution, only that he wants to punish us in this country. Can\u2019t he see that the prices of goods are unbearable? The prices of goods are going up now and then. We can\u2019t bear it again in Nigeria because the prices of things are increasing every minute.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, before now, we normally bought small Hollandia milk for N60, now it is N100. If you want to buy noodles, a carton goes for N950. Now, we are buying it for N2,450. The Spaghetti that I used to buy for N2,400 now goes for N4,800 per carton. As traders, we are tired, we just sit under the sun getting nothing,\u201d she said. She complained of low sales, as she said Nigerians are not to blame for this downturn, but the president.\n\nNext to Sherifat was a pepper trader, who identified herself as mama Mulikat, she stated that : \u201cThe cost of food is no longer a joke, it has become really expensive, most especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4,000, but now, it is N18,000 or N17,000. I can\u2019t afford to buy a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6,500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13,000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy a bit from other traders.\n\n\u201cThe cost of pepper and tomatoes is as high as N18,000 this year compared to 2015 when a basket was sold for N4,000. Some of the traders complained that the government is involved in the hike of prices. The traders also complained of over taxation and the high cost of transportation to Lagos.\n\n\u201cI heard that some security officials collect up to N25,000 from traders just to bring the goods into Lagos. When we approached the dealers to reduce the price, they became furious,\u201d mama Mulikat said.\n\nJuliet Okonedo, another trader who sells dried fish said the president should have mercy on the masses, saying it was not a good way of repaying the masses that voted for Buhari. She said everything in this country has gone up, wondering that if things continue like this before expiration of this administration\u2019s tenure many Nigerians will die of hunger.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari should come to our aid. If things continue like this many Nigerians will die of hunger. He should know that we have children who are in higher institutions and most of us bear the burden of their fees. Where is the money now that things are expensive and money is hard to come by amidst inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir fees are now very high. I have sponsored three children who are now graduates from different universities in Nigeria. The fees I am currently paying on my last child are more than the money I paid to train his older ones through school. The government should help us.\u201d\n\nAde Onitiri, a butcher, shared similar experience. Recounting his experiences, Onitiri said he had been recording losses in the last six months. \u201d How many people come to me to buy meat, just a fraction compared to say two years ago. \u201d My take is that Buhari has killed us with high cost, while his kinsmen, the Fulani herdsmen kill our brothers and sisters who are farmers in the villages with AK-47.\u201d\n\nAnother trader, who sells fruits, Baba Ahmed, said the price of a measure of dates that used to cost N1,500, rose to N2,000 at the beginning of the year.\n\nWhile calling on the Federal Government to address the situation, Lagosians threatened a mass protest to shut down the country if the situation continued.\n\n\u201cThe government should know that everyone is not a civil servant that receives salaries. We are not depending on the government to pay bills other than this business than we do. Some of us have graduated from school without working.\n\nI am not happy at all and if President Buhari or anyone responsible does not do something, we will close down our businesses till our yearnings are heard,\u201d IsiakaJimoh, another butcher said.\n\nAn insurance executive who spoke with Business Hallmark in confidence said: \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Lagos State Government and receive a salary, but at the end of the month, I pay the debt because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a bottle of Coca Cola soft drink now? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying. It keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nSix years into Buhari\u2019s presidency, public trust in the Nigerian government has declined to a record low alongside a growing perception of lacking political inclusion. This gloomy outlook is hardened by negative economic impacts caused by the pandemic, and a sense of undelivered political promises, leading to stagnation in the country.\n\nRecall that in September 2020, during a ministerial retreat to assess his stewardship, Nigeria\u2019s President MohammaduBuhari declared his administration\u2019s progress in all fronts to improve his citizens\u2019 quality of life and set them on the path to prosperity. Speaking further, he commended his administration for innovatively addressing insecurity and insurgency by rehabilitating and re-integrating repentant terrorists into society. Seemingly triumphant, he affirmed that his administration is on the right course and highlighted their efforts in building strong institutional capacities to fight corruption, while urging his appointees to defend his government by going on the offensive to better present information.\n\nBut many analysts and observers have said the president was being economical with truth and mealy- mouthed to whitewash his gross failures at different levels.\n\nProfessor AdeagboMoritiwon, a political scientist said \u201d on record, this administration is the worst in the history of the country.\u201d He said what Buhari said in 2020 Presidential Retreat and the white washing of his failures by his apologists are now clear to Nigerians to be nothing but absolute falsehood.\n\nIn his election manifesto were promises to ensure the equitable distribution of the nation\u2019s wealth and close the gap between different classes. He had committed to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next ten years, but he did not explain, however, how he intends to achieve this. Many Nigerians did not believe their President, and currently many more rather feel the opposite about his positive self-assessment \u2013 that things have actually gone from bad to worse under Buhari\u2019s watch.\n\nEvidence of this is the fact that today, poverty, unemployment and mass hopelessness literarily defines the lives of most Nigerians.\n\nSuch a self-assessment of success begs certain questions: could this stance be a political pretence or stem from a genuine insensitivity to the pulse of the street? Professor Adeagbo believes it was delusion of grandeur with a dose of pretence for Buhari to ascribe success to his many failures.\n\nWith an unenviable reputation as the world\u2019s new poverty capital, about 40% (82 million people) of Nigeria\u2019s population are living on less than 1$US per day, according to figures from National Bureau of Statistics. Amidst repeated claims by the government of undertaking measured to alleviate poverty, the recent increase in fuel pump prices and electricity tariffs has triggered questions about Buhari\u2019s commitments and priorities. Considering the economic downtown experienced by many Nigerians in a period marked by a remarkable loss of jobs and income, owing to the severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the decision to eliminate the expensive but popular petrol subsidy programme, and likewise the programme for electricity tariffs, is considered insensitive to the realities on ground and generally an act in bad-timing.\n\nIn the last five years, the price of food items has risen steadily, with rice that used to sell for 9,000 naira per bag in 2015 now tripled up to about 26,000 naira \u2013 a fact acknowledged by the Nigeria\u2019s Minister for Finance, Budget and Planning, Zainab Ahmed. This has impacted disproportionately the poor in a country that is said to be already hosting a high population of the world\u2019s poorest citizens.\n\nFor many in the country now then, the question is how much longer would this state of distress continue?",

          "text": "OlusesanLaoye\n\nControversies are still trailing the forceful open of the Idiroko border in Ogun State, South West of Nigeria by some angry youths, who claimed to be part of the groups agitating for the self determination of the Yoruba to have Oduduwa Republic.\n\nThe youths in their hundreds while protesting to show the seriousness of their agitations, stormed the Idiroko border, which is one of the most active popular borders in the Southwest to the Benin Republic.\n\nThe youths who felt the closure of the border has been affecting the business activities of the people in Yoruba land, argued that the present Government of President MuhammaduBuhari closed the border, as part of the agenda of the North, to cripple the the economy \u00f2f the people in the the South west Nigeria, while business activities are still booming at the Nigerian borders in the North.\n\nThe federal govenment had since 2019 announced the closures of all the borders in Niger\u00eca, on the grounds of security, curbing illegal smuggling of goods to bring more revenue to the coffers of govenment and to streamline exportation and importations of goods through the land borders.\n\nIt was ordered that any goods that will be coming to Niger\u00eca should come through the seaports\u2019 but the arguement of the Yoruba self determination youths was that the issue of the sea port was applicable to the South alone where there are ports and not the North where there are no ports and which they believed has made the closure one sided. They also believed that normal business activities are still going on at the Northern borders.\n\nThis they claimed, informed their resolve to forcefully opened the border, claiming that Yoruba Nation has come to stay and they can not watch their people suffer because the closure has grounded commercial activites at the South West borders.\n\nIt was observed that within the two days that the youths chased the customs and imigrationn officers away from their border posts, there were jubilation among the traders who claimed that they have suffered a lot, since the border was closed to commercial activites in 2019.\n\nThe traders in the area expressed joy as they appealed to the federal government to restore normalcy and restoration of business activities to the border towns.\n\nHowever, their jubilation was short lived as the security operatives launched a severe attack to repel the protesting youths, who forcefully opened the border.\n\nAlthough they were repelled at Idiroko, they informed journalists that the exercise would be a continuous one and they would from time to time, move from one border to the other in the South West. \u201cBecause Yoruba nation is no more part of Nigeria and we are ready for anything they want to do\u201d.\n\nOne of those who believed that the federal govenment was not fair to the people of the South west, MrDeboAkingbade, said they were disappointed for the continued closure of the border because the IdirokoSeme border used to serve people from Togo Benin a\u00f1d Ghana. He argued that because of the movements of goods commercial activities were booming but since the closure of the border\u2019 \u201d we now have everything grounded. Our school are closed, petrol Stations closed, only few traders now come to the market, taxi drivers have nothing to do as before and nothing is moving\u201d\n\nSome of the traders who spoke appealed to the federal government to permanently reopen the borders.\n\nThe customs Public Re\u013aation Officer for Ogun1 Area Command, Hammed Oloyede said that the customs and other security operatives were able to bring the situation back to normal after repelling the angry youths who seized the border.\n\nHe said \u201cthere was no attacks on our patrol points ad the youths were just doing.g their own thing\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the customs are now at alert and would not allow anyone to cause break down of law and order.\n\nBut Sunday Adeyemo alias Sunday Igboho who spoke on the incident said that the Federal government of Nigeria just closed the border to punish the people of the South West because all the borders in the North are operational.\n\nHe argued that the closure \u201cis part of the war the government of the North is fighting with us in the West a\u00f1d.the entire South.\u201d\n\nHe went on, \u201cwhen they started fighting and killing our farmers we never knew their game plan, it was later that we discovered that they were doing that to destroy our crops so that we won\u2019t be able to farm and depend on their own products. But we were able to repel them and that was why we drove the Fulanis out of our land.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the boys did was just to show the Fulani led government that enough is enough and it would be a continuous action.\n\nWe can\u2019t just imagine the borders here in Yoruba \u013aand being closed to shot down our economy, whereas business is going g on as usual in all the borders in the North. That is why we are saying let them be on their own and we shall be on our own and develop on our own.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sunday Igboho who is a strong agitator for the actualisation of Oduduwa nation, was in support of the youths action for the forceful opening of the border, the group under the umbrella which Sunday is using to promote the self determination agenda of the Yoruba nation, the IlanaEgbeOmoOdua led by Professor BanjiAkintoye has condemned their actions.\n\nThe communications officer of the group Mr Maxwell Adeleye has said that the IlanaEgbeOmoOdua did not know those who carry out the act.\n\nAccording to him, the group led by Professor Akintoye \u201cis known for its peaceful approach towards achieving our aim of se\u013af determination for the Yoruba race.\u201d\n\nHe argued, \u201cWe would never approve of violence in pursuing our goals and the security operatives know us for this.We do what is lawful without violence\u201d\n\nIt will be recalled that the comptroller of customs \u00c7ol Hammed Ibrahim Alli (rtd) while closing the borders said that it was meant to improve the revenues of Nigeria and to curb the activities of smugglers and as well curtail criminal activities at the borders.\n\nBut in his own point of view the Se\u00f1at\u00f2r.Reprepsenting Ogun West Senator\u00ecal District, Senat\u00f2rTolulopeOdebiyi whose father Jonathan Odebiyi was the minority leader in the second Republic Senate, under the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), said the Federal government should reconsider its stand and open the border.\n\nHe argued that the closure has affected the people of the state and those living at the border towns.\n\nHe pointed out that the government should consider the proximity of the border in his senatorial district to the manufacturers in Ogun State, who would want to import their products to other west African countries like Togo, Gha\u00f1a\u2019 Ser\u00ecalone and even the Republic of Benin.\n\nAccording to him, these industries in Agbara, Sango Otta and Badagy in Lagos State are really complaining since the borders have been closed in 2019\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the government to open the borders for businesses to strive .\n\nWe do not support the forceful opening of the Idiroko border and we hope the Federal government would consider the plights of people who do legitimate business to open the borders\u201d",

          "text": "By Our Reporters\n\nAlthough all mortals face death at the the end of their sojourn on earth, the passage of black Africa\u2019s arguably most prominent televangelist and philanthropist, Prophet Temitope Balogun, shocked the world and threw multitudes into mourning and wailing.\n\nOnly on Saturday, TBJoshua, as he was popularly called, memorably remarked: \u201cTime for everything \u2013 time to come here for prayer and time to return home after the service.\u2019\u2019 He spoke during the Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting, perhaps his parting words.\n\nJoshua, pastor and founder of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN) passed on at the age of 57.\n\nThe actual cause of death had yet to be made known yesterday.\n\nJoshua was one of the most controversial and \u201cenigmatic\u2019\u2019 Nigerian pastors of all time, especially with his preaching style and records of miracles.\n\nJoshua, born on June 12, 1963 in Ondo State, Nigeria, reportedly stayed 15 months in his mother\u2019s womb before he was born.\n\nAccording to the SCOAN website, Joshua attended St. Stephen\u2019s Anglican Primary School, Ikare-Akoko, Ondo State, 1971-1977.\n\nHe had only one year of secondary education before he left to work in a poultry farm.\n\nWhile in school, he was known as \u2018small pastor\u2019 because of his love for the scriptures and gift to predict things that would happen in his community; he was also said to have been the leader of the \u2018Scripture Union\u2019 while in school.\n\nHe taught children at evening classes and done some menial jobs before he had a revelation to set up a ministry while on a 40-day fast.\n\nIn 1987, Joshua founded SCOAN under the bridge that links Ejigbo and Egbe in Lagos State with just a few members.\n\nThe church later grew to have large congregations within and outside Nigeria, especially other parts of Africa and Latin America.\n\nHe later established the Emmanuel TV station from Lagos which has wide viewership especially as it is on cable television.\n\nJoshua was a renowned generous philanthropist, particularly noted for helping the needy and sponsoring persons.\n\n\u2018My People FC\u2019, a football club he started in 2009, was part of his efforts to help the youth and two members of the team, Sani Emmanuel and Ogenyi Onazi, played for the Nigerian Golden Eaglets in the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\n\nAlso, three players of the club were sponsored abroad to play professional football in Sweden.\n\nWBO International Light Middleweight boxing champion King Davidson Emenogu, had said that Joshua financially supported him throughout his career.\n\nA man of many clouts, Forbes in 2011 wrote that Joshua was the third-richest pastor in Nigeria with an estimated net worth of between $10 million and $15 million.\n\nHe was so popular that Wikipedia documented his social media presence to be massive with no fewer than 3.5 million fans on Facebook.\n\n\u201cHis YouTube channel, Emmanuel TV, has over one million subscribers.\n\n\u201cHe was the world\u2019s most viewed Christian ministry on the platform before it was suspended.\n\n\u201cHe was described as the \u201cOprah of Evangelism\u201d and \u201cYouTube\u2019s most popular Pastor.\u201d\n\nLike many influential men, Joshua was not without controversies.\n\nOn Sept, 12, 2014, a guesthouse collapsed in the SCOAN\u2019s premises in Lagos, killing no fewer than 115 people.\n\nSpeculations continued to trail the circumstances that led to the collapse, with a former Nigerian Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, alleging that \u201cNigeria\u2019s intelligence agencies \u2018blew up\u2019 the building\u2019\u2019.\n\nAlso, his relationship with other clerics was not smooth. Some also questioned the miracles that occurred in his church.\n\nYet, Joshua was unperturbed and in a 2006 book, \u201cThe Mirror,\u201d he said: \u201cWhatever I am today is a product of the conviction that victory through Christ Jesus is victory indeed. The rest is history.\u201d\n\nJoshua made impact in education, healthcare, peace and reconciliation, among others.\n\nA Forbes blogger said that it was estimated that Joshua spent $20 million on \u201ceducation, healthcare and rehabilitation programmes for former Niger Delta militants.\u201d\n\nHe received repentant persons who cut across all walks of life including their and rehabilitation and \u2018deliverance\u2019.\n\nSCOAN has a scholarship programme that sponsors many pupils and students in primary, secondary and even tertiary institutions.\n\nIn 2012, it was widely reported that Joshua sponsored a Nigerian student doing a PhD in the United Kingdom.\n\nHis worldwide humanitarian relief involvement was outstanding and included Joshua\u2019s efforts during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and April 2016 in Ecuador, where he gave aid worth over $500,000.\n\nIn Ecuador, he funded the rebuilding of a rural school destroyed during the earthquake.\n\nJoshua sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area in Haiti and instituted a field hospital called \u2018Clinique Emmanuel\u2019.\n\nHe also supported several groups of Nigerian returnees to resettle in the country, following their attempt to travel illegally to Europe.\n\nOne of his most significant reconciliatory efforts was his involvement in the meeting of the family of the late President of Liberia, Samuel Doe, with the former warlord Yormie Johnson, who was responsible for the tiny country\u2019s leader\u2019s death.\n\nThe Nigerian government, in recognition of his humanitarian activities, gave him a National Honour, Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) in 2008.\n\nThe United Nations also gave him a letter of appreciation.\n\nArewa Youth Forum, a predominantly Muslim organisation, recognised him as Ambassador of Peace and ZAKA, Israel\u2019s primary rescue and recovery voluntary service, gave him an \u2018award of excellence.\u2019\n\nThe eminent clergyman was married to Evelyn Joshua and had three children.\n\nJoshua\u2019s last words in public were: \u201cWatch and pray.\u201d \u201cOne life for Christ is all we have; one life for Christ is so dear.\u201d\n\nMr Kunle Olowoopejo, the Executive Chairman, Egbe-Idimu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos where SCOAN\u2019s headquarters stands, described Joshua as a complete definition of what humanity should be.\n\nAccording to him, he was generous and no matter your colour, ethnicity, tribe, language or religion, his hands of fellowship has no bound and that\u2019s why both young and old keep echoing \u201cAlaanu Mekunnu lo.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Synagogue, Joshua left a legacy of service to and sacrifice for God\u2019s Kingdom which will continue to live on for generations yet unborn.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Economic Summit Group and economic experts on Sunday described the Federal Government\u2019s ban on a social media network, Twitter, as ill-advised.\n\nThe NESG, in an interview with The PUNCH, said people, particularly the small and medium entrepreneurs, would suffer, adding the ban would compound Nigerians\u2019 economic woes.\n\nOthers who spoke to The PUNCH included a former President of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr Sam Nzekwe; a Professor of Economics and Public Policy, Prof Akpan Ekpo; the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria and the Lead Director, the Centre for Social Justice, Eze Onyekpere.\n\nThey lamented the impact of the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria on businesses, warning that the development was capable of triggering more job losses in the country\n\nRecall that the relationship between the Federal Government and Twitter went sour on Wednesday when the network deleted a post on the Nigerian Civil War by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nThe President, had on Tuesday in the post hinted that he would treat IPOB and other secessionist groups, \u201cin the language they understand,\u201d a tweet, which was deleted by Twitter on the grounds that it violated its rules.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Government reacted angrily, saying Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria was suspicious.\n\nOn Friday, the Federal Government suspended, indefinitely, the operations of Twitter in Nigeria. It said Twitter\u2019s operations violated Nigeria\u2019s cooperate existence.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who on Friday announced the suspension, cited what he described as \u201cthe persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe ban, which sparked public outrage, has been condemned by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, among others.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses,\u201d the US Mission in Nigeria said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nBan will dampen foreign investors\u2019 interest in Nigeria \u2013 Experts\n\nThe NESG, a private sector-led think-tank, and economic experts, who spoke to our correspondents in separate interviews, said the ban on Twitter would dampen foreign investors\u2019 appetite to invest in the country and take a toll on the government\u2019s digital economy drive.\n\nThe President, Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Mr Femi Egbesola, lamented the adverse effect the ban would have on small and medium-scale enterprises.\n\nAccording to him, the social media, of which Twitter is a leading platform, provides a cheaper option of advertising.\n\nEgbesola said, \u201cSMEs would no longer be able to advertise their products and services on Twitter. This ban would disrupt the tens of thousands of small businesses that create more than 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s employment.\n\n\u201cTwitter might have been at fault for censoring the President\u2019s tweet, but the government should consider the positive side. The ban would affect employers and may lead to the loss of jobs which would worsen the unemployment woes of the country. We appeal to the government to reconsider the ban.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, NESG, Mr. \u2018Laoye Jaiyeola, said, said the ban would have a significant impact on the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe impact of Twitter ban on Nigerian economy is not good. Generally, some of us will want to believe that the President must have been ill-advised on the ban. The digital space is one area that we have every potential to grow as a national, given the fact that a number of our people that do not have work at least are able to carry out some legitimate work on the social media.\n\n\u201cIt is important that in time like this, we are careful how we add to people\u2019s problems. In a way, it will discourage those who are supposed to come and invest in Nigeria. The small and medium enterprises suffer, and the people suffer.\u201d\n\nJaiyeola said although the NESG had not done any research on how much the country would lose, it had done a study on the impacts of the digital economy on the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt (digital economy) is not just an enabler to the economy but a sector that we must mine to grow. If well harnessed, it could take people out of poverty and create more jobs.\n\n\u201cLet us not mess up an area where we do not even have control. This is an area where we want people to come and develop. This action is not in the interest of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nA professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Akpan Ekpo, described the Twitter ban as a wrong signal to investors.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt will scare potential investors from coming to Nigeria because it is global practice to allow Twitter to operate.\n\n\u201cAlthough the government says this is temporary, it is still not a good omen for investors, especially foreign investors and portfolio investors (hot money), they would be scared since they do not know what would happen to other platforms so they might take out their money.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ekpo, there is a need to think through decisions before taking them.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe tech space would suffer; they would not raise the amount they raised last year, which was a good year. Tech investment will reduce, although this is an opportunity for innovation also.\n\n\u201cFDI inflow will be greatly reduced. The government should have thought about the business aspect. A lot of young people get employment on this platform and now it is affected, with a high unemployment rate they should have been careful before taking this decision.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ekpo, investment is a part of GDP, and once investment declines, employment will too.\n\n\u201cInvestment generates employment. The Nigerian economy is in a state of stagflation; we have rising inflation and unemployment. So, there is a need for thorough thinking before making economic decisions, so we don\u2019t worsen our situation. I am hoping that very soon they will reverse the suspension in the interest of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nA former President of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr Sam Nzekwe, said the suspension would negatively affect the Federal Government\u2019s plan for a digital economy and portray the government in a bad light internationally.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is going to affect online businesses badly because they have to start looking for an alternative for advertising their goods and services, and those alternatives may be expensive.\n\n\u201cIn a way, it is going to affect the digital economy. Our economy is still a small one; we need to deploy all facets of digital tools, and I hope that this issue gets resolved.\u201d\n\nTwitter ban costs Nigeria $2.18bn daily\n\nParadigm Initiative, a digital advocacy organisation, put the cost of suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria at $250,600 per hour.\n\n\u201cExactly 24 hours ago, the government of Nigeria announced the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria. Since then, the country has lost N2,177,089,051 ($6,014,390) based on the cost of Shutdown Tool. The loss continues at a rate of N90,712,044 ($250,600) every hour,\u201d it said on Saturday.\n\nThe company used the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool to arrive at the estimate. The tool estimates the economic impact of internet disruptions, mobile data blackouts or app restriction using indicators from the World Bank, International Telecommunication Union, Eurostat, and US Census.\n\nA finance officer at Greenville LNG, Ogidiaka Ovie, said, \u201cGovernment policies, over time, have discouraged investors. Many multinationals will continue to withdraw from Nigeria like Shoprite. The business environment is harsh in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will surely affect the economy as many businesses now thrive on the Internet. Nigeria may risk denial of loans from multilateral creditors as the majority of these institutions are controlled by the United States, and they have a way of protecting their businesses.\u201d\n\nA finance officer at Vedic Lifecare Nigeria Limited, Okorie Iheanacho, said, \u201cA lot of business transactions are being carried out on Twitter. As a result of the ban, there may be a temporary loss of activities there. Unemployment may occur if it lingers for long as companies would reduce their admin expenses.\n\n\u201cThe ban sends a negative signal to both prospective and existing investors on the economy as they would not like to have a physical presence in Nigeria. This will lead to reduction in income flow to the economy in the form of tax.\u201d\n\nLift ban or be sued, PDP Reps threaten FG\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party caucus in the House of Representatives asked the Federal Government to lift the ban or it would take legal action against it.\n\nLeader of the PDP caucus, Kingsley Chinda, made this known in a statement on Sunday and titled \u2018Press Release on Suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\u2019\n\nOn his part, the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, said that the ban had no solution to any of the myriad of problems confronting the nation.\n\nOrtom described the ban as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nAccording to the statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, Ortom said, \u201cThe Twitter ban offers no solution to any of the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nHe stressed that the move was only capable of heightening tensions and fuelling suspicions among Nigerians.

We appeal to the government to reconsider the ban.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, NESG, Mr. \u2018Laoye Jaiyeola, said, said the ban would have a significant impact on the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe impact of Twitter ban on Nigerian economy is not good. Generally, some of us will want to believe that the President must have been ill-advised on the ban. The digital space is one area that we have every potential to grow as a national, given the fact that a number of our people that do not have work at least are able to carry out some legitimate work on the social media.\n\n\u201cIt is important that in time like this, we are careful how we add to people\u2019s problems. In a way, it will discourage those who are supposed to come and invest in Nigeria. The small and medium enterprises suffer, and the people suffer.\u201d\n\nJaiyeola said although the NESG had not done any research on how much the country would lose, it had done a study on the impacts of the digital economy on the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt (digital economy) is not just an enabler to the economy but a sector that we must mine to grow. If well harnessed, it could take people out of poverty and create more jobs.\n\n\u201cLet us not mess up an area where we do not even have control. This is an area where we want people to come and develop. This action is not in the interest of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nA professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Akpan Ekpo, described the Twitter ban as a wrong signal to investors.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt will scare potential investors from coming to Nigeria because it is global practice to allow Twitter to operate.\n\n\u201cAlthough the government says this is temporary, it is still not a good omen for investors, especially foreign investors and portfolio investors (hot money), they would be scared since they do not know what would happen to other platforms so they might take out their money.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ekpo, there is a need to think through decisions before taking them.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe tech space would suffer; they would not raise the amount they raised last year, which was a good year. Tech investment will reduce, although this is an opportunity for innovation also.\n\n\u201cFDI inflow will be greatly reduced. The government should have thought about the business aspect. A lot of young people get employment on this platform and now it is affected, with a high unemployment rate they should have been careful before taking this decision.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ekpo, investment is a part of GDP, and once investment declines, employment will too.\n\n\u201cInvestment generates employment. The Nigerian economy is in a state of stagflation; we have rising inflation and unemployment. So, there is a need for thorough thinking before making economic decisions, so we don\u2019t worsen our situation. I am hoping that very soon they will reverse the suspension in the interest of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nA former President of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr Sam Nzekwe, said the suspension would negatively affect the Federal Government\u2019s plan for a digital economy and portray the government in a bad light internationally.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is going to affect online businesses badly because they have to start looking for an alternative for advertising their goods and services, and those alternatives may be expensive.\n\n\u201cIn a way, it is going to affect the digital economy. Our economy is still a small one; we need to deploy all facets of digital tools, and I hope that this issue gets resolved.\u201d\n\nTwitter ban costs Nigeria $2.18bn daily\n\nParadigm Initiative, a digital advocacy organisation, put the cost of suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria at $250,600 per hour.\n\n\u201cExactly 24 hours ago, the government of Nigeria announced the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria. Since then, the country has lost N2,177,089,051 ($6,014,390) based on the cost of Shutdown Tool. The loss continues at a rate of N90,712,044 ($250,600) every hour,\u201d it said on Saturday.\n\nThe company used the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool to arrive at the estimate. The tool estimates the economic impact of internet disruptions, mobile data blackouts or app restriction using indicators from the World Bank, International Telecommunication Union, Eurostat, and US Census.\n\nA finance officer at Greenville LNG, Ogidiaka Ovie, said, \u201cGovernment policies, over time, have discouraged investors. Many multinationals will continue to withdraw from Nigeria like Shoprite. The business environment is harsh in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will surely affect the economy as many businesses now thrive on the Internet. Nigeria may risk denial of loans from multilateral creditors as the majority of these institutions are controlled by the United States, and they have a way of protecting their businesses.\u201d\n\nA finance officer at Vedic Lifecare Nigeria Limited, Okorie Iheanacho, said, \u201cA lot of business transactions are being carried out on Twitter. As a result of the ban, there may be a temporary loss of activities there. Unemployment may occur if it lingers for long as companies would reduce their admin expenses.\n\n\u201cThe ban sends a negative signal to both prospective and existing investors on the economy as they would not like to have a physical presence in Nigeria. This will lead to reduction in income flow to the economy in the form of tax.\u201d\n\nLift ban or be sued, PDP Reps threaten FG\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party caucus in the House of Representatives asked the Federal Government to lift the ban or it would take legal action against it.\n\nLeader of the PDP caucus, Kingsley Chinda, made this known in a statement on Sunday and titled \u2018Press Release on Suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\u2019\n\nOn his part, the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, said that the ban had no solution to any of the myriad of problems confronting the nation.\n\nOrtom described the ban as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nAccording to the statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, Ortom said, \u201cThe Twitter ban offers no solution to any of the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nHe stressed that the move was only capable of heightening tensions and fuelling suspicions among Nigerians.

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nThough founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T.B. Joshua is dead, one thing that he took to the grave was that he was rejected in the Christendom in Nigeria. His case was like the rejected cornerstone which Jesus spoke of in Matthew 21:42, which read: \u201cDid ye never read in the Scriptures: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner. This is the Lord\u2019s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d\n\nDespite Joshua\u2018s exploit, the Christian bodies in Nigeria never accepted him, both the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN). To them, Joshua was simply an exorcist or a charmer and so on.\n\nJoshua was reputed to have said that he was converted in his mother\u2019s womb.\n\nThe likes of Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer, Redeemed Christian Church of Nigeria (RCCG), Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor, Bishop David Oyedepo and many others rejected Joshua until his death.\n\nAdeboye, in 2009 said he would never go to Joshua\u2019s church to minister.\n\nHe was quoted as saying in the Vanguard when asked whether he could worship in Joshua\u2019s church, \u201cNo! Definitely not! If he wants me to come and minister in his church, we will sit down; we will discuss the issue of salvation the way I understand it, according to the scriptures.\n\n\u201cIf we agree on that and he now wants me to come and preach the same message of salvation in his church, then I will go.\u201d\n\nTo Adeboye, Joshua was never born again and so, he could not associate himself with him.\n\nOritsejafor, when he was PFN president and CAN chairman said the body would not admit Joshua to its fold because they were not convinced that he was a child of God.\n\nHe had said then that before Joshua could even qualify to be a PFN member, he should show who tutored him as a pastor in the first place.\n\nOritsejafor was quoted as saying that \u201cJesus did not say by their words you will know them; he said by the fruit you shall know them. If T.B. Joshua can show me his pastor who pastored him before he said he was called into the ministry; if T.B. Joshua can tell me when he got converted and how he got converted, then we would consider him. Anybody who is a Christian is a Christian because he received Jesus Christ at a point.\n\n\u201cI gather he said he was converted in his mother\u2019s womb and I don\u2019t see anybody like that in the Bible. It is a conscious decision you make and it doesn\u2019t happen in your mother\u2019s womb.\u201d\n\nHe said healing and miracles were not criteria for admitting anyone into the PFN fold or CAN.\n\nAccording to Oritsejafor, \u201cWe are not taking T.B Joshua but like I said, he too can repent and be converted tomorrow. T.B Joshua can say I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and personal saviour; I repent of my sins. Then he can say, come check me out and see what I am doing then we can consider accepting him. PFN is for all; nobody is really excluded.\u201d",

          "text": "Evelyn Joshua, wife of the founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet T.B. Joshua, on Sunday addressed the public on the death of her husband.\n\nDespite the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, Evelyn spoke about Joshua\u2019s death via a tweet.\n\nShe told the public to seek refuge in God because losing a loved one can be heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cLosing a loved one is never easy; whether sudden or foreseen. It is always heart-breaking. Grief can wreak havoc on our overall well-being,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to stay rooted to the Almighty.

          "text": "Though Prophet T.B. Joshua, the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), is no longer alive, one thing he took with him to the cemetery was his rejection by Nigerian Christians. His situation was similar to the rejected cornerstone spoken by Jesus in Matthew 21:42: \u201cDid ye never read in the Scriptures: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?\u201d This is the Lord\u2019s doing, and we think it\u2019s wonderful.\u2019\n\nDespite Joshua\u2019s achievements, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) refused to recognise him (PFN). Joshua was simply an exorcist, a charmer, and so on to them.\n\nJoshua was claimed to have been converted while still in his mother\u2019s womb.\n\nPastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of Nigeria (RCCG), Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor, Bishop David Oyedepo, and many others all turned their backs on Joshua till he died.\n\nIn 2009, Adeboye stated that he will never minister at Joshua\u2019s church.\n\nWhen asked if he could worship in Joshua\u2019s church, he was cited in the Vanguard as stating, \u201cNo!\u201d Certainly not! If he wants me to come and minister in his church, we\u2019ll sit down and talk about salvation the way I understand it, according to the Bible.\n\n\u201cI will go if we agree on that and he now wants me to come deliver the same salvation message at his church.\u201d\n\nJoshua was never born again in Adeboye\u2019s eyes, thus he couldn\u2019t link himself with him.\n\nOritsejafor, when he was PFN president and CAN chairman said the body would not admit Joshua to its fold because they were not convinced that he was a child of God.\n\nHe had said then that before Joshua could even qualify to be a PFN member, he should show who tutored him as a pastor in the first place.\n\nOritsejafor was quoted as saying that \u201cJesus did not say by their words you will know them; he said by the fruit you shall know them. If T.B. Joshua can show me his pastor who pastored him before he said he was called into the ministry; if T.B. Joshua can tell me when he got converted and how he got converted, then we would consider him. Anybody who is a Christian is a Christian because he received Jesus Christ at a point.\n\n\u201cI gather he said he was converted in his mother\u2019s womb and I don\u2019t see anybody like that in the Bible. It is a conscious decision you make and it doesn\u2019t happen in your mother\u2019s womb.\u201d\n\nHe said healing and miracles were not criteria for admitting anyone into the PFN fold or CAN.\n\nAccording to Oritsejafor, \u201cWe are not taking T.B Joshua but like I said, he too can repent and be converted tomorrow. T.B Joshua can say I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and personal saviour; I repent of my sins. Then he can say, come check me out and see what I am doing then we can consider accepting him. PFN is for all; nobody is really excluded.\u201d",

          "text": "The restiveness in Imo state continued Sunday with security agents drawn from the army, police and related agencies repelling attack on the state police command in Owerri, the state capital.\n\nHowever, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information and Strategies, Declan Mbadiwe Emelumba, was not that lucky as Ubulu-Ihejiofor, his country home in Oru West local government area of the state, was razed by some unidentified gunmen in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nAnd in yet another attack in Delta state, a police station was set ablaze with police killing six suspected kidnappers in a fierce gun duel.\n\nThe tragic developments, Blueprint gathered, have heightened tension in the entire South-east and the adjoining states.\n\nImo attack\n\nConfirming the botched attack on the Imo state police command in a statement in Owerri, the command\u2019s spokesman, Bala Elkana said: \u201cThe attackers, who came in a white Hummer bus, wanted to access the Command Headquarters through Works Layout around Alvan Nursery and Primary School Owerri but had a bloody fight with the security forces.\n\n\u201cThey were first intercepted by the Military at the outer perimeter cordon provided for the Police. Five of the hoodlums were killed in action (KIA) including Joseph Uka Nnachi alias King of Dragons.\n\n\u201cOne suspect Stanley Osinachi \u2018m\u2019 30 years old of Achi/Mberi , Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State was arrested and presently aiding investigation. He confirmed that Dragon is the leader of the gang in Imo State reporting to their supreme leader Nnamdi Kanu. He stated that, they belong to the proscribed IPOB and ESN.\u201d\n\nElkana further said four AK 47 rifles with 2000 rounds of live ammunition and large number of explosives were recovered from the scene and that the rifles breech numbers were crosschecked and found to be the same police rifles stolen by the hoodlums from the Police station at Omuma on 31st May, 2021, during which four policemen were killed.\n\nHe also said, as found in a viral video, it was the same gang that blocked the Orji Flyover some days ago during which three people were killed, including a woman who was blindfolded.\n\nThe police spokesman also quoted the Commissioner of Police in the state, Abutu Yaro, as commending the gallant efforts of the security forces \u201cwho put their lives on the line to ensure the restoration of normalcy in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the CP pleaded with those still in possession of stolen weapons to return them to the nearest police stations.\n\nOther recovered items were: Assault (AR) Rifle Breach No: 03018058;\n\nAssault (AR) Rifle Breach N0: 070007055; Assault (AR) RIFLE Breach No: 5801297: Six locally fabricated Explosive Devices; Police Beret Cap;\n\n7 AK47 Magazines fully loaded; 1 military cap; 1 military cardigan (Polo);\n\n1 Silver Coloured Mini Bus with Reg N0: WAM-8673 B ABD; I Hummer Bus with Reg No: KED-382 X laden with Explosive Devices.\n\nCommissioner\u2019s house burnt\n\nIn a related development, Blueprint gathered that two houses in the compound of the state\u2019s commissioner for information and strategies, were set ablaze.\n\nThe development, Blueprint gathered, left villagers running helter-skelter and scampering into the bush for safety as news of the arrival of security forces filtered the air.\n\nMr Emelumba confirmed the development when contacted by one of our correspondents.\n\nSimilar incident occurred at Ibiasoegbe, a neighbouring village three days ago where three persons, including a policeman was killed.\n\nEmelumba is believed to be a member of the kitchen cabinet of the Hope Uzodimma administration and was one of the commissioners who survived a recent cabinet reshuffle by the governor.\n\nDelta\n\nMeanwhile, the Delta state Police command Sunday killed six suspected armed robbers and kidnappers terrorising the state.\n\nThe hoodlums were engaged in a gun duel by the police operatives in their hideout, during which six of them were killed on the spot.\n\nConfirming the incident, the state police public relations officer, DSP Bright Edafe said, \u201cAt about 1435hrs on 5/6/21, acting on a tip off, the commissioner of police Delta state, deployed joint tactical teams of the command who stormed the hideout of suspected armed robbers/kidnappers, engaged the hoodlums in a serious gun duel.\u201d\n\nHe said the hoodlums numbering about 20, stormed Ashaka police station in the early hours of Sunday and set it ablaze along with the patrol vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey threw IEDS at the station, shot sporadically, and set the police station that was built by the community/DESOPADEC ablaze, and also burnt down one patrol vehicle also bought for the police division by good people of the community just to ensure that police presence is not felt.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that no life was lost and no arm was taken away. Unprovoked attacks on the police will not deter the police from providing the needed security in any community in Delta state,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDSP Edafe further said the joint security team killed six of the criminals while others fled with gunshot injuries into the bush, with one AK 47 rifle, one pump action gun, one AK 47 magazine with 25 live ammunition recovered.\n\nThe PPRO also said: \u201cOn 5/6/21 at about 2130hours, the men of Delta state command while on stop and search duty along Patani-Bayelsa road intercepted a sienna bus with Reg. no. LSR 813 XL with four occupants, on sighting the police, they quickly tried to manoeuvre in a bid to escape, the police went after them.\n\n\u201cOn searching the vehicle, one locally made Barretta Pistol was recovered, and four suspects namely, Efe Oyenikoro \u2018m\u2019 Felix George \u2018m\u2019 Emmanuel Job \u2018m\u2019 Joan Yapiteghe \u2018m\u2019 were arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Ari Muhammed Ali has given marching order to\n\nOyo attack\n\nAlso in another development, no fewer than 10 people were Saturday night feared killed in Igangan, Ibarapa North local government of Oyo state by armed men suspected to be bandits\n\nThe gunmen were said to have invaded the town in the night on about 20 motorcycles shooting sporadically during which the palace of the traditional ruler of the town, Asigangan and a popular petroleum station were razed\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen said to be numbering about 50 shot at those trying to escape from the scene of confusion.\n\nThe state secretary of farmers union, based in the town, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, said in the ensuing melee, no fewer than 10 people were reportedly killed.\n\nAdeagbo gave the breakdown of the casualties to include five residents and five of the bandits, saying, the gunmen waged war on Igangan from about12 midnight today (Sunday).\n\n\u201cThey burnt many properties- cars, a truck and burnt a petrol filling station. We will know the exact number of people killed, those injured and the number of properties they destroyed in the morning. It is still dark now, things will be clearer later,\u201d he said.\n\nConfirming the attack, the state Police command in a statement said: \u201cOn Saturday at about 2310hrs, a yet to be ascertained number of unknown assailants invaded Igangan town with dangerous weapons in a bid to create unrest in the town.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by the command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Adewale Osifeso said: \u201cThe unscrupulous elements were however repelled by a combination of Operational and tactical assets immediately deployed to the scene to restore normalcy. The situation is being closely monitored and comprehensive investigations are ongoing to apprehend the perpetrators.\u201d",

          "text": "Prominent contender in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, Chief George Moghalu, has expressed confidence he\u2019ll emerge as the preferred All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate should the party go for consensus.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the national secretariat of APC after submitting his nomination and expression of interest forms, Moghalu noted that winning the Anambra State Governorship election would require consensus of the political elites across party lines, adding that for APC to win the election \u201cwe have to generate this consensus and we have to do that only with a candidate that is generally acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe party chieftain said, \u201cIf I must be honest with you, I will wish there is consensus and that consensus will be me but the truth about it is that, I know a good number has collected forms and I know a good number has returned their forms but that is not to say that there is still no room for discussion.\u201d\n\nThe constitution of the ruling APC allows for direct primary, indirect primary and consensus as the three options for conducting primary election to produce its candidate.\n\nThere is presently no sign of the party adopting the consensus option but Moghalu remains upbeat there is possibility of discussion in that direction.\n\n\u201cIn politics, 24 hours is a long time. I\u2019m sure that consultations will still take place. People will look at the possibility of working together but the important thing here is that, as I always said, every person is qualified to be governor. So I respect that belief as we go along.\n\n\u201cSince Consensus is not the only option, it is either direct primary, indirect primary or consensus. Since it is part of the option available to us, I don\u2019t see why we cannot exploit it because the important thing is that we remain united as a political party, that we remain together because if we are together, the likelihood of being stronger is there. So that door is not shut. I\u2019m sure that we could still exploit that option.\n\nWhile emphasizing that the election of November 6 will not be a tea party, but rather a strong contest as every party will come to the election with their best with the desire to win, the party chieftain expressed confidence that he has got enough experience to match the demands of the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to the business with experience, with knowledge, with capacity, with integrity, with courage and determination to win the election. So I want to once again say thank you to all of you who accepted to be with me at this time,\u201d Moghalu said.\n\nSpeaking earlier while receiving the submitted forms from the aspirant, secretary to the national caretaker committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, assured that the party will ensure that a level playing ground is provided for all the aspirants at the forth coming party primary.\n\nUdoedehe maintained that the party has no anointed candidate and it is ready to work with who ever emerge at the primary.",

He is perhaps the only president since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 who never grants live interviews or holds media chats. This move is therefore aimed at making him unaccountable to the people of Nigeria who constantly take to social media platforms to share their views on the actions and policies of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that shutting down Twitter is illegal and illegitimate policies such as this are unacceptable!\n\n\u201cA 2016 United Nations resolution affirms that the rights that citizens have offline must apply online. Coincidentally, this resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria with others. We urge the Nigerian authorities to respect and enforce citizens\u2019 fundamental rights as provided for by the Nigerian constitution and International human rights treaties that Nigeria is a party to\u201d.\n\nThe group added that it will further contact the Ministry of Information to get exact details of the announcement, and the legal framework that supports such undemocratic pronouncement.\n\nThe group, however, advised all users of Twitter and other social media platforms in Nigeria to download virtual private networks (VPNs) to enable them to continue to use the platforms for their economic survival and social and political engagements while they all push back on this draconian order by the Nigerian government.",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Sunday announced the increase of foreign exchange (forex) allocations to banks to meet the requests of customers, particularly travellers, seeking forex for travel allowances, payment of tuition and medical fees, among other invisibles.\n\nThe moves followed the warning by the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, at a weekend meeting with managing directors of Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), cautioning them to desist from denying customers, particularly travellers, the opportunity to purchase forex for Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), Basic Travel Allowance (BTA), tuition fees, and medical payments as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) transactions or for the repatriation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) proceeds.\n\nConfirming the discussions at the meeting of bank chiefs, the Acting Director, Corporate Communications Department at the CBN, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, said in a note that the CBN remained committed to ensuring liquidity in the forex market to meet genuine and legitimate demands of customers.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe CBN agreed to increase the amount allocated to banks for travellers, Small and Medium Enterprises among others. The banks also agreed to operate something akin to foreign exchange imprest account such that the coffers of banks will be replenished so long as they retire the initial amounts to the satisfaction of the CBN.\u201d\n\nNwanisobi allayed fears of a forex shortage and urged members of the public seeking to purchase foreign exchange for PTA, BTA, payment of tuition fees or medical fees to do so from their banks.\n\n\u201cWe wish to assure members of the public that the CBN shall continue to monitor market developments and is committed to ensuring an efficient FX market for all legitimate users,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, advised customers to approach their customer service representatives of their designated banks should they encounter challenges, adding that they could escalate complaints to the CBN via the bank\u2019s toll-free line: 07002255226 or send an email to cpd@cbn.gov.ng if their requests are not met.\n\nSources at the meeting with the bank CEOs held to address the challenge faced by customers in accessing forex from their banks, said Emefiele warned that the CBN would deal with any bank that denies customers the opportunity to purchase foreign exchange for legitimate purposes.\n\nAccording to the source, Emefiele said the CBN management frowned upon the seeming difficulty customers experienced in accessing foreign exchange through the banks, particularly for Invisibles such as PTA and requests bordering on tuition and healthcare needs.\n\nEmefiele had last week reiterated the bank\u2019s commitment to ensuring steady availability of foreign exchange for manufacturers.\n\nEmefiele had also urged banks as well as Nigerians to strive to end environmental pollution and ensure sustenance of banking principles.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "title": "Despite Ban, Open Grazing Persists in Nigeria\u2019s Southern States",
          "text": "Despite the ban on open grazing of cattle by Southern governors, the practice has continued to flourish in the 17 states of the region with stakeholders asking for legal backing for the proscription order.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigations at the weekend showed that the delay by the governors in enacting laws in their states to legalise the ban has heightened concerns among residents, particularly in the farming communities of the states.\n\nWith the absence of the law, according to THISDAY\u2019s investigations, herders have continued to openly graze their cattle, leading in some cases to frequent clashes between them and farmers whose farmlands suffer devastation due to the movement of the animals.\n\nThe governors, under the aegis of the Southern Nigeria Governors Forum (SNGF), rising from a meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, on May 11, had, among others announced a ban on open grazing to check the escalating conflict between farmers and herders.\n\nHowever, their decision had riled the federal government with President Muhammadu Buhari querying the legality of the ban.\n\nIn Ondo State, THISDAY gathered that the Bill against Open Grazing and other Matters Related has passed through the second reading but the lawmakers couldn\u2019t go further in the legislative process due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nBut open grazing by herders has reduced drastically in the state, particularly in places close to urban areas.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the herders still move their cows in many villages like Osi, Ogbese, Ala, Igbatoro, Eleyowo and other villages in Akure North Local Government Area.\n\nAlso, sources told THISDAY that the practice is still going on in villages in Ondo North but not with the impunity earlier displayed by herders.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Commander of the Ondo State Security Network, Amotekun, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said open grazing had reduced in the state as the security agency no longer give them chances to continue the illegal practice.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, thinking that we would not have some herders still engaging in open grazing in view of the ban and the operation of Amotekun is like saying why do we still have crime when there are policemen working?\n\n\u201cOndo State Government through Amotekun is not relenting. The herders know they are doing the wrong thing. Once they see us, they run away. They know they are doing the wrong thing destroying some people\u2019s means of livelihood for yours to thrive, we see it as being unfair.\n\n\u201cThe position of government is very clear about it. No open grazing is no open grazing, and anybody that is engaging in it is doing illegal thing and anybody that is caught, will face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nIn Cross River State, the herders were still practising open grazing as usual in some communities in Odukpani, Obanliku, Yala, Yakurr, and Obubra Local Government Areas.\n\nHowever, THISDAY gathered that there have been no clashes between the herders and any of the communities since the cows are restricted to the areas where they have been grazing for decades.\n\n\u201cThe owners of the cows pay rent to the community for the space the cows are taken to feed in the bush along Calabar-Itu highway. That is how we have been operating with them for years, and there is no problem; we have never heard problems,\u201d a community leader from Okoyong confided in THISDAY.\n\nHowever, the state government is insisting that it will not go it alone, but would wait for the southern governors to work out modalities on the way forward.\n\nPress Secretary to the Cross River State Governor, Mr. Christian Ita, said grazing in restricted area was not strange to the state having established the first cattle ranch in Nigeria; the Obudu Cattle Ranch Resort.\n\n\u201cAs I said, I am sure modalities would be worked out at the Southern governors\u2019 level, and then we proceed from there,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Anambra State, despite the ban on open grazing, herdsmen still graze cattle in communities in the state, even within the state capital territory, in open fields and on farms belonging to farmers.\n\nMr. Fredrick Okoye, a farmer in Umuokpu community, Awka South Local Government Area, told THISDAY that despite the ban on open grazing, Fulani herdsmen still graze their cattle on their farms, damaging their crops daily.\n\n\u201cThere is a law which states that if Fulani people destroy your crop, they will pay you for it, and if farmers kill cattle, the farmer will pay for it. But to tell you the truth, that arrangement has not been working. If they (herders) destroy your farm, they don\u2019t pay. If you kill their cattle, they also do not even report for payment, rather, they think of a reprisal.\n\n\u201cThat is the major reason we are afraid. They graze on our fields everyday, even today. If you come to Umuokpu today and wait until afternoon, you will see them,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Okpuno and Mgbakwu communities, all around the state capital, cattle were seen in the area, grazing in open fields.\n\nThere have been cases of clashes between herdsmen and farmers in Anaku, Omor and even in riverrine parts of Anambra State.\n\nAnambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba, said the anti-open grazing law was unnecessary as the proclamation of the ban by the governors was enough for the herders to comply.\n\nThe Speaker, Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Marcus Onobu, also told THISDAY that the persistent open grazing of cattle in the state was due to the inability of the state government to come up with legislation against it.\n\nOnobus said Governor Godwin Obaseki was yet to come up with a bill to legalise open grazing.\n\nHe added that though a private bill against open grazing exists, the legislature was yet to debate it because it requires public hearing.\n\n\u201cBut I think the major problem is the strike action by legislative workers because already, we have a private bill before us.\n\n\u201cEven if we want to rely on the private bill without waiting for the governor, we are still going to have a public hearing, and we cannot do that since the legislative workers\u2019 strike has not been called off,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, without a legislation, it will be difficult to enforce the ban on open grazing as verbal pronouncement is not enough because aggrieved persons can go to court to seek redress.\n\nIn Delta State, open grazing persists in the forest, particularly in Ughelli, Abraka, Oghara in Delta South and Central Senatorial zones.\n\nHowever, security arrangement and agitations by the people have reduced open grazing.\n\nMr. Olisa Ifeajika, Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, confirmed to THISDAY that there has been a reduction in open grazing in the state.\n\nIfeajika said the state was yet to enact a law against open grazing due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nDespite the anti-open grazing law in Oyo State, herders are still openly grazing their cattle in most areas of the state.\n\nAreas where open grazing is still going on in the state include Ibarapaland, Oyo/Ogbomoso expressway, Oke Ogun and some parts of Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nThe state House of Assembly in October 2019 passed a bill titled, \u2018Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Law\u2019, which was signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nHowever, Makinde has expressed the determination of his administration to enforce the law, stating that the state government will within the next eight weeks launch a task force to enforce the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Oyo State, open grazing is against the law. The implementation plan will come out within the next six to eight weeks and the task force will cut across Oyo State. So, whoever goes against the law in this state will face the wrath of law and that is just it.\u201d\n\nMakinde\u2019s Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Taiwo Adisa, while speaking on the challenges facing the implementation of the law, identified the major one as the lack of commitment of the police and other security agencies to enforce the law.\n\nFarmers operating in Ekiti State have also raised the alarm that open grazing of cattle and other ruminant animals are still happening in all the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\nSome farmers told THISDAY in Oke Ako, Irele and Ipao in Ikole Local Government Areas and Ijan and Aisegba in Gbonyin Local Government area as well as Aaye Oja, Igogo and Osan in Moba Council Area that the practice was still effective in their areas.\n\nTHISDAY observed that the practice was even common in Ado Ekiti, the capital city, especially along Ado-Ijan-Ikare, Ado-Iworoko-Ifaki and Ado-Ikere-Akure roads.\n\nHowever, the State Commander of Ekiti State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe (rtd), said the law was being vigorously enforced by the security outfit.\n\nHe said the outfit had been zealous in the enforcement of ban on open grazing of cattle, adding that some herders and cattle had been arrested with owners already in court facing charges while their cows were confiscated.\n\nAkomolafe added that his officers had engaged in shootout with some herders around 2:00am on more than four occasions around Ikole axis, which he said attested to the proactiveness of Amotekun to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our statutory duties to enforce the law and we are doing it. We have arrested scores of cattle owners who are in court facing charges but their cases got stalled by JUSUN\u2019s strike. Some are still being detained by the police.\n\n\u201cWe know that some herders are still disobeying this law, but we are extending our dragnets against them. Even most of them who are returning to the North due to the advent of rain used to take permission from us and we took pain to escort them to the border in Kwara or Kogi to ensure that no destruction takes place,\u201d he added..\n\nThe ban on open cattle grazing was yet to be enforced in Imo State.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Imo State Government has so far not send any anti-open grazing bill to the House of Assembly.\n\nAt the moment, herdsmen are still seen in the bushes and by the road sides grazing their cattle without anybody or security personnel challenging them.\n\nEven in the Owerri, the capital city, as well as in other various villages and communities, open grazing still goes on unchecked.\n\nAreas where the herdsmen usually go for grazing include Irette, Avu, Obinze, in Owerri West LGA; Emekuku, Agbala, Amakohia/Akwakuma in Owerri North LGA.\n\nOther areas are Obowo, Okigwe, Mbaise, and other Local government areas.\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City, James Sowole in Akure, Bassey Inyang in Calabar, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Sylvester Idowu in Warri, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti and Amby Uneze in Owerr",

          "title": "No Legal Basis for Prosecuting Twitter Users, Nigeria\u2019s Senior Lawyers Tell Attorney General Malami",
          "text": "\u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference\u201d \u2013Section 39 (1) CFRN\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has continued to face searing criticisms of its decision to suspend the operation of the American microblogging social network, Twitter, in Nigeria as some Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) on Sunday told THISDAY that the action contravened Section 39 (1) of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThey also dismissed the directive of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to the Federal Director of Public Prosecution, to arrest and prosecute any user of Twitter in defiance of the suspension order, as offensive to Section 36 (12) of the Constitution as altered.\n\nSection 39 (1) stipulates: \u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyers argued that the suspension amounted to a hindrance of the citizens\u2019 right to receive information.\n\nThey further argued that the threat of prosecution by the AGF has no basis in law as it clearly violates Section 36 (12), which states: \u201cSubject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that the offence is defined and the penalty, therefore, is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of law.\u201d\n\nMalami, had in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu, had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to work with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy to ensure speedy prosecution of alleged violators.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also described the suspension of Twitter as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nJoining the fray, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives threatened to sue the federal government over the suspension of Twitter operations.\n\nThe lawyers, in separate interviews with THISDAY day, described the action of the government as illegal, null and void and unenforceable.\n\nThey said the suspension in the first place was illegal because it infringed on the fundamental human rights of the citizens.\n\nThe lawyers, citing portions of the law, stated that the government cannot prosecute anyone under a non-existent law.\n\nHuman Rights activists and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ozekhome, citing decisions from the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, said: \u201cNo citizen of Nigeria can be tried or punished for an alleged offence not created by law.\u201d\n\nOzekhome, who faulted the directive of Malami, warned that the government should \u201cbe ready to build thousands of prisons across all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria so as to accommodate the deluge of \u2018erring\u2019 Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, there must be a statutory provision creating an offence before any person can be convicted for the said offence.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe punishment too must be specifically named in a legislation. The apex court emphatically stated that it is rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act that is not qualified as an offence not defined or stated (codified) in any law and the punishment thereof prescribed.\n\n\u201cAll the above judicial authorities are crystal clear that neither Malami nor the DPP, nor this government, can prosecute any Twitter user. Using Twitter is not a known crime or written offence.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the National Assembly has not enacted any law banning the use of social media, including Twitter, Ozekhome said the mere verbal pronouncement, declaration, directives or threats by Malami could not amount to a law validly passed by the National Assembly.\n\nChief Godwin Obla (SAN) described the suspension of Twitter as senseless and not legally justiciable because there is no order proscribing Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nObla, who noted that what the federal government did in the first place was to stop telecommunication companies from allowing Twitter to use their platform to operate in Nigeria, said that no Nigerian could be punished for merely using Twitter which according to him is an online means of disseminating information.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is nowhere and I have not seen the order by the Attorney-General proscribing Twitter because there must be an order. Can the federal government on its own have breached the citizens\u2019 right to disseminate and to hold and manage information? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cSo, if a Nigerian citizen is using another IT platform, say, the United States platform, he can disseminate information; it\u2019s a piece of online information, it\u2019s not physical. If my Twitter account is a US Twitter account, I can tweet from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ban does not make sense. It is not legally justiciable. I do not see how it can be enforced, and I don\u2019t see how any citizen can be found guilty of such an offence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN), wondered when a pronouncement by a minister becomes a law on which citizens could be prosecuted.\n\nHe said for anyone to be arrested and arraigned before a court of law, there must be an offence, adding that in this instance, there is no known law for which a person has disobeyed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any law that says if there is a pronouncement by a minister, it becomes an offence,\u201d he said, explaining: \u201cTo arrest someone there must be an offence, a written offence. There must be a law; you must refer to a law that says anybody that disobeys an order or a statement by the minister is an offence but there is nothing like that, there is definitely no law like that.\u201d\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Chief Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), also stated that there is no known law on which Nigerians could be prosecuted for using Twitter and added that the power to make criminal laws rests with the National Assembly and not the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not aware of any law that has been enacted by the National Assembly. The president cannot enact criminal law, only the National Assembly can do so.\n\n\u201cCriminal laws are not enacted in secrecy; it has to be published before it can be effective.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN), said, President Muhammadu Buhari lacked the power to use state institutions to fight personal battles.\n\nDaudu also clarified that the decision of Twitter to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account \u201cis not a matter between Nigeria and the social networking service.\u201d\n\nHe made this clarification in his response to THISDAY\u2019s inquiries on the constitutionality of the federal government\u2019s decision to suspend Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria.\n\nDaudu said every Nigerian operating a Twitter account \u201cdoes so in his own name, even if the underlying objective is to promote the objectives and aspirations of his constituency, business outfit or even office.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said Buhari, though a very eminent personality \u201cis an individual customer of Twitter with no greater rights than the other millions of persons who have also subscribed to Twitter and agreed to their rules and conditions of membership.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter perceived that Buhari broke its rules and applying one of the sanctions open to it removed the offending tweet. Whether the account was blocked or suspended is really not the issue at this point in time,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, therefore, said the president lacked the power to use state apparatus and institutions \u201cto hit or get back at Twitter, which is what he has done in retaliation by banning them from Nigeria using state institutions such as the NBC and the NCC to deprive all Nigerians of their access to Twitter.\u201d\n\nMr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) also stated that before anyone could be punished for any offence in Nigeria, the offence must be defined and the punishment thereof must be prescribed in a written law.\n\n\u201cThis is what is stipulated by Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that except there is an existing law that proscribes the usage of the Twitter account, \u201cit is unconstitutional to arrest let alone prosecute anyone for using Twitter\u2019s services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also told THISDAY that the parliament is currently looking into the recent suspension of Twitter by the federal government, with a view of getting a critical analysis before taking a position on the trending issue.\n\nKalu said: \u201dThe House is busy looking into the trending Twitter issue as expected for any federal parliament. It is time for an in-depth critical analysis of the entire picture not yet time for press releases on the issue. But be rest assured, it won\u2019t be long before we make our position known in line with our laws and democratic principles.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer and former National Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, condemned the attempt to prosecute violators of the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAjulo opposed Malami\u2019s position, saying: \u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site in Nigeria, it is imperative to note that the provisions of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution are clear to the effect no one shall be prosecuted for an offence not known to law.\n\n\u201cI have carefully stated the contents of our various penal laws and nowhere is a citizen of the country prohibited from receiving or disseminating information, which is a right guaranteed under Section 39 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOrtom described the suspension of Twitter operations in the country as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nThe governor said the Twitter suspension offered no solution to any of the problems facing the country, as the move was only capable of heightening tensions and fuelling suspicions among Nigerians over the real motives of the federal government.\n\nOrtom, in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, said that suspending Twitter amounted to suppressing freedom of expression, gagging social media and undermining fundamental human rights of Nigerians, a development contravening Chapter four of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nOrtom emphasised the need for the federal government to listen to the views and yearnings of the people to enable it to address the challenges confronting the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives has threatened to sue the federal government in court over the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nIt described the decision as an act of desperation of a non-performing and failed government to intimidate and cow the citizens to consolidate its hold on power by brute force.\n\nThe Leader of the caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said Twitter had become an integral component of the citizens\u2019 ability to keep the government in check and to provide real-time feedback on the impact of the government\u2019s activities on the citizenry.\n\nThe PDP has accused the National Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP said facts available to it showed how APC leaders at one of their party\u2019s national caucus meetings recommended the regulation of social media in Nigeria and how they have been plotting to obliterate internet-based interaction platforms such as Twitter.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the APC Caucus had been pushing bills in the National Assembly, particularly in November 2020, seeking to enforce a draconian regulation of social media so as to gag Nigerians from exposing its atrocities, including human right abuses, treasury looting, nepotism and sectional marginalisation by the APC administration.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cNigerians can also recall how the APC administration in carrying out the agenda of its party has been using the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to suffocate the media space with humongous fines and threats of suspension of operating licences of broadcast stations.\u201d\n\nBuhari: We Are Taking the Lead in Cyber Policing\n\nProtocols:\n\n1. It is with great pleasure that I address you today on this occasion of the 2019 Annual Investment Meeting here in Dubai.\n\n2. I wish to thank His Royal Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates, for inviting me to speak at this event.\n\n3. This is the ninth edition of such a gathering. At this point, I want to congratulate His Highness, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum for his vision to support such a platform where world leaders in both the public and private sectors exchange ideas on how to make this world a better place.\n\n4. This morning, my brief remarks will be on digital globalisation, which we all agree is transforming the world as we know it. Almost every day, innovations and transformative ideas are rolled out. This trend is here to stay.\n\n5. Today, we have a cyber world that is intangible but real. This borderless world is powerful, and it impacts the lives of billions of people, no matter how remote their physical locations are.\n\n6. People work in it. People socialise in it. And people invest in it. This presents enormous opportunities. But it also remains a constant threat if left unregulated.\n\n7. On the one hand, it has made the human race more productive and more efficient. Today, we have digital banking, virtual currencies and many social platforms that connect people and cultures.\n\n8. On the other hand, we have seen platforms hijacked and manipulated as evidenced by the steady rise in fake news and cybercrimes.\n\n9. More recently, we are also witnessing the use of the cyber space to manipulate elections, subvert the democratic rights of citizens as well as propagate violence.\n\n10. In effect, the digital world has become the new frontier for both good and evil. Therefore, the challenge for world leaders must be to ensure that this space is inclusive, accessible and safe.\n\n11. In Nigeria, our mobile phone penetration exceeds eighty per cent. This means majority of Nigeria\u2019s one hundred and ninety million citizens are fully connected to this new digital world; especially our youth.\n\n12. Sixty five percent or one hundred and seventeen million Nigerians are under the age of 25 years. These bright minds are the drivers of this emerging digital sector.\n\n13. Today, Nigeria has close to ninety technology hubs and every day, new ones are coming up and they are all developing solutions for Nigerian, and indeed global problems.\n\n14. Already, these young entrepreneurs have attracted investments of over one hundred million dollars. A sizeable amount from overseas including Silicon Valley.\n\n15. As many of you from this region are aware, Nigerian start-ups always have a very impressive outing at the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition (GITEX). Many have won prizes.\n\n16. As leaders, it is therefore our responsibility to create the enabling environment for these minds to flourish and reach their full potential.\n\n17. When we came in 2015, we immediately agreed that any future economic growth must be inclusive.\n\n18. As the Nigerian youth population are fully digitalised, it is clear that the idea of having an inclusive economy cannot be achieved without digital inclusion.\n\n19. We therefore leveraged and supported digital platforms in our numerous socio-economic programs: from training extension workers in agriculture, health and education sectors; to enabling micro-credits to increase financial inclusion.\n\n20. However, whilst this digital globalisation has occurred rapidly in the private sector, many governments and regulators have not kept pace.\n\n21. New waves of cybercrime and terrorism continue to threaten the positive strides being made.\n\n22. On cyber security, Nigeria has taken the lead in cyber policing in West Africa. In this, we are working with our regional and global partners.\n\n23. Furthermore, our public sector reform programs focus on digitising key operations. From procurement to payroll to revenue collections, we are using digital platforms to reinforce our objectives of improving efficiency, accountability and transparency in governance.\n\n24. We are also working on creating the largest digital database in Africa. Already, our digital identity system has captured over thirty million Nigerians and legal residents.\n\n25. As earlier observed, the digital world is borderless. In many instances, the criminals in this world are faceless and without physical addresses. This is why we must all come together to protect the good while eliminating the bad.\n\n26. Emerging threats are difficult to prevent or manage unilaterally. It has to be a collective effort, led by both public and private sector leaders \u2013 many of whom are here today.\n\n27. A certain level of regulation is needed to preserve the integrity of the digital economy.\n\n28. I therefore would ask all of us here present, over the coming days, to put our heads together and come up with proposals on how we create a digital world that is accessible, inclusive and safe.\n\n29. I thank you for listening and wish you very successful deliberations.\n\n\u2022Being the text of keynote speech delivered by President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Annual Investment Meeting in Dubai, UAE, on April 8, 2019\n\nDavidson Iriekpen, Nseobong Okon-Ekong, Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi",
