          "text": "The Nasarawa State Police Command says it has arrested a 35-year-old woman, Rifkatu Haruna, for allegedly stealing a three-year-old male child in the state.\n\nDuring a parade of the suspect and 18 others on Wednesday in Lafia, the state Commissioner of Police, Adesina Soyemi, noted that Haruna was apprehended in Garaku, in the Kokona Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHe said the suspect, who had been on the wanted list of the police, was arrested following a tip-off received by men of the command.\n\nThe commissioner added that preliminary investigation into the case revealed that the woman, who allegedly collaborated with other suspects, stole the baby from Garaku town and planned to sell him to a prophetess in Enugu State.\n\n\u201cThe traffickers took the child to Enugu State, but could not sell him, so they brought him back. The suspect ran out of luck and was arrested; other accomplices are still on the run.\n\n\u201cWe are now trailing the other suspects and I promise to do everything within the law to ensure that they are apprehended no matter their status in the society,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen our correspondent spoke to the suspect, she confirmed that she was arrested in Garaku town while returning the baby to his mother.\n\nShe, however, denied belonging to a syndicate, adding that she only helped the woman to rescue her stolen child.\n\nHaruna said, \u201cI am not a member of the gang and I did not steal the baby. I only wanted to help the mother of the child locate her stolen baby. I am innocent of the crime.\u201d\n\nWhile warning criminal elements to leave the state, Soyemi said all the suspects would be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department in Lafia for further investigation after which they would be charged to court.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Mohammed Abu, said the suspects were arrested by the Nigerian Navy Ship Thunder on November 6 during a routine exercise.\n\n\u201cI am handing them over to you as the prosecuting agency to carry out further investigation and prosecute them accordingly and revert to the Nigerian Navy on the outcome,\u201d Abu added.\n\nThe commanding officer, however, denied recent reports that economic activities were grounded in Ibaka by sea robbers, adding that the reported attacks happened outside the Nigerian maritime borders.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on fishermen were not on Nigerian maritime waters; they were attacked at Abana, which is outside our maritime boundary. Several times, I have engaged the fishermen in the base here and advised them not to go to Cameroon to fish.\n\n\u201cThe other aspect is that the fishermen don\u2019t only go there to fish, they go at night. And sea robbers take advantage of the night to attack.\n\n\u201cI assumed duty when the fishermen were no longer going out for fishing for six weeks and that was what informed their protest. I strategised and gave them the green flag that I would support them and ensure that they were not attacked.\n\nRead Also Navy arrests seven diesel smugglers in Cross River\n\n\u201cI deployed our boats and identified the creeks where they (hoodlums) were operating within Mbo waterways. As I speak to you, I have three of our boats that have choked them up in the creeks within the waterways at Unyenge, Okposo and Ikang.\n\n\u201cSo, this does not give these robbers within our maritime domain freedom of action to operate. As you can physically see, the fishermen are back from sea after their fishing expedition,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Head of Anti-Vandals, NSCDC, Akwa Ibom State, Assistant Commandant of Corps, Adamu Jafaaru, received the suspects and the exhibits on behalf of the agency.\n\nJafaaru warned vandals to desist from sabotaging the economy, stressing that the NSCDC would not relent in its mandate of protecting critical infrastructure.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He rightly acknowledged that I was scheduled to visit his client and at the same time, claimed that I violated the guidelines stipulated for visiting his client. According to him, he was supposed to be present at the 2pm meeting on Monday.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cSeveral people, including Barrister Ejiofor, have tried to misinterpret and misinform the public about my visit to my brother, Nnamdi. I also read a report stating that I took pictures with Nnamdi and also tweeted same on my Twitter account.\n\n\u201cFor the records, the Department of State Services (DSS) did not break any protocol during my visit as I fulfilled all the requirements expected of me before I saw Nnamdi. The DSS affirmed that I cannot see Nnamdi without the application of his lawyers which I diligently did.\n\n\u201cProbably, Barrister Ejiofor may have expected me to arrive at 4pm for a scheduled 2pm visit. What many people refer to as \u201cAfrican time\u201d is not my style. I strictly keep to time and it is a discipline I have upheld since my childhood. I arrived the DSS headquarters at 1:50 PM ; went through the necessary protocols and met Nnamdi at 2:17 PM. I stayed with him until 2: 57 PM. Even though he asked that I stayed longer but I had to leave because of other engagements .\n\n\u201cDuring my visit to Nnamdi, I did not even take my mobile phone along and no photograph was taken. The photograph people are circulating was the one I took with him when I visited him at the Nigerian Correctional Service Medial Security Custodial Centre, Kuje in 2016 and later, his parents in 2017. My Twitter account has also been inactive .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t also know if Barrister Ejiofor is aware that Nnamdi is not under compulsion to see anyone. If he didn\u2019t want to see me, he could have as well declined, but he was glad to see me and also expressed deep appreciations.\n\n\u201cEjiofor\u2019s anger seems to be borne out of vexation of not being around to listen to our conversations. He sounds like someone who is a beneficiary of the crisis. People like him may not see the economic damage the Southeast is experiencing because of the weekly sit-at-home. He does not understand that people can protest in peace without disrupting economic activities and going violent. He does not understand that there are people whose livelihood solely depends on daily hustle.

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike\n\nThe management of Dowen College, Lekki in Lagos, has debunked the insinuations making rounds online that 12-year-old, Sylvester Oromoni Junior, a student of the school, was beaten to death by suspected cultists in the school for refusing to join a cult group.\n\nA cousin of the deceased, Perrison Onomoni, who broke the news via his Twitter handle, alleged Sylvester was battered by five students on Friday and later died on Tuesday. He said several test and X-rays revealed that he sustained internal injuries.\n\nIn a swift reaction to the tweet, the Principal of the college, Mrs. Adebisi Layiwola, said preliminary investigation conducted by the school authorities revealed that there was no fighting, bullying or any form of attack on Sylvester.\n\nLayiwola said in a statement that on November 21, 2021, one of the hostel parents reported that the boy was injured while playing football, adding the resident registered nurse immediately administered first aid on him and after he expressed relief, was released to return to his hostel room.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt came as no small shock to us to read on the social media that he was beaten by some students and that he specifically mentioned some names. We immediately commenced investigations and invited the students allegedly mentioned for interview.\n\n\u201cHis guardian was also present during the interviews, which revealed that nothing of such happened.\u201d\n\nLayiwola in statement made available to Daily Sun said Sylvester was in class on Monday, November 23 but during school hours one of his friends accompanied him to the Sick Bay where he complained of some pain in his hip.\n\n\u201cThe doctor examined him and prescribed Ibuprofen for the pain, while the nurse massaged his leg, after which he felt a bit better.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with school policy, the resident doctor called his mother reporting the incident and requesting that she come for him so that he could get further medical attention. The mother however said she was not in Lagos, spoke and prayed with him on the phone and promised to send the guardian to pick him up immediately for further medical attention.\n\n\u201cWhen the guardian failed to show up, the next day on November 23, the doctor called the mother again and this time, she assured that his guardian would pick him from school. His guardian showed up and took him for X-ray after which the guardian informed the school management that the results of the investigation revealed that no part of his body was broken or injured.\u201d\n\nLayiwola said she also spoke with the mother on the phone to enquire about his progress and she reported that he was having a massage and gave the phone to him to speak with the her.\n\nThe principal explained that the whole incident was strange and unbelievable because\n\nthe school has effective anti-bullying policies and consequences are well spelt out to all the students.\n\nShe said Sylvester made no such reports, neither his sister who is also a student or any other students, prefects, house parents, medical staff or any of the management staff.\n\nLayiwola revealed that the resident doctor followed the laid down procedure by inviting his mother to take him home for further treatment after initial treatment by the school\u2019s medical staff.\n\n\u201cThe school has a very cordial relationship with the family as he is the fifth child of the family Dowen College has the privilege to train, including his elder sister who is currently a student at the school.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we state categorically Dowen College is built on core values of godliness and excellence and will not tolerate any acts of cultism, which is why there is nothing like that and there has never been such deviant activities going on, as this is a faith based school and effective policies are in place to prevent such occurrence,\u201d she stressed.\n\nThe principal expressed sadness by the death of Sylvester who had such a bright future ahead of him, stating \u201cwe extend our deepest sympathy and heart-felt condolences to his family, relatives, friends, classmates and the alumni family at this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nAttachments area\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said on Wednesday that its system has detected the new COVID-19 variant Omicron.\n\nThe NCDC said the variant was detected in the cause of its genomic surveillance for inbound international travellers arriving in the country at its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja and a network of other testing laboratories.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nNCDC Director General Dr Ifedayo Adetifa explained in a statement that samples obtained for the stipulated day two test for all travellers to Nigeria were positive for the variant in three persons with a history of travel to South Africa.\n\nHe said that sequencing of samples from COVID-19 positive inbound travellers was being conducted in laboratories with sequencing capacity in the country and all the sequencing data are shared in publicly accessible databases.\n\n\u2018These cases were recent arrivals in the country in the past week. Follow up to ensure isolation, linkage to clinical care, contact tracing and other relevant response activities have commenced,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Equally, arrangements are also being made to notify country where travel originated according to the provisions of the International Health Regulations.\u2019\n\nThe NCDC assumes that Omicron variant is widespread globally given the increasing number of countries reporting it. \u2018Therefore, it is a matter of when not if, we will identify more cases.\n\n\u2018We would continue to expand our sequencing capacity in-country at the NCDC-NRL, through our network of public health laboratories and other partners.\n\n\u2018Our focus is to complete sequencing of recently accrued samples of SARS-COV-2 positive travelers from all countries, especially those from countries that have reported the Omicron variant already,\u2019 Dr Adetifa said.\n\nHe said that since reports of the emergence of the Omicron variant, the Federal Ministry of Health through the NCDC has intensified public health response measures to COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The national travel advisory has also been revised by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, and now requires all inbound travelers to Nigeria present a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Similarly, pre-booking and payment for all day two and day seven COVID-19 PCR tests are prerequisites for travel. In addition, all outbound passengers regardless of the requirements of destination countries are expected to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\u2019\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country.\n\nThe NCDC recommended that states ensure sample collection and testing should remain widely accessible so that people who have symptoms or have been exposed to a positive case get tested quickly in healthcare and other settings.\n\nThis, it said, can be achieved through increased COVID-19 testing using approved antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that are being rolled out by the NCDC and partners as well as PCR tests where applicable.\n\n\u2018Vaccination also reduces community transmission and States should effectively implement ongoing mass vaccination campaigns and encourage citizens to make use of every available opportunity to get vaccination,\u2019 the NCDC suggested.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022$20bn spent on EPC, oil sector services in four years, says NCDMB\n\n\u2022Sylva optimistic about investments inflow\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited yesterday attributed the current global gas crisis to shortage of investments in the oil sector as activists, investors, and climate change advocates continue to mount pressure on banks and oil companies to withdraw funding for fossil fuel related projects.\n\nNNPC said there might be no end in sight to the overheating of the oil market, which could even worsen if the required financing of major oil and gas projects continued to lag.\n\nSpeaking in Yenagoa during the 10th Practical Nigerian Content (PNC) Conference organised by Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), the Group Executive Director, Upstream, NNPC, Adokiye Tombomieye, urged Nigeria to look inwards for financing of major projects.\n\nThe event was attended by several industry and non-sector players, including the governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who was represented by the Director, Human Resources Management, Dr. Famous Eseduwo; and the NCDMB Executive Secretary, Simbi Wabote.\n\nOthers at the event included Country Chair, Shell Nigeria, Osagie Okunbor; Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mele Kyari, who attended virtually; Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Petroleum Agency (NURPC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe; and several top shots in the oil and gas industry.\n\nTombomieye, who was represented by the Group General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) Bala Wunti, said there had been a downward spiral in investment in the oil and gas industry since 2000. But he stressed that with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) things would change from 2022.\n\nTagged, \u201cDriving Nigerian Content in the New Dawn of the Petroleum Industry Act,\u201d the NNPC top official, who spoke during one of the sessions, maintained that there was an on-going trend of upward movement in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe reason is not far-fetched,\u201d Tombomieye stated, adding, \u201cWe have seen the consequence of uncertainty in the industry. Investment and uncertainty never mix.\u201d\n\nTombomieye explained, \u201cWhether we go ahead with the energy transition or not we have already created a monster and that monster is that we now have finance activists, investment activists that have come into the space to create problems for energy investment.\n\n\u201cEnergy investment is being attacked and will continue to be attacked in the fossil fuels industry. Investment capital is now very discriminatory against fossil fuels, but not only that, it has become more and more impatient.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to invest today and recoup the money tomorrow. Nobody wants to invest that money for 10 years, but I need to let you know that the upstream space is not a day\u2019s job. You will invest today and wait for 10 years. These issues have created an impediment to investment.\u201d\n\nAccording to the GED, the crunch on finance and investment has not created the new energy crisis across the globe, but has seen the prices of gas skyrocketing in the last few months.\n\nHowever, he stated that the situation had also brought about significant opportunities for Nigeria, which would now have to look elsewhere to finance major projects.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not getting money from JP Morgan and I\u2019m not getting money from Blackwell, if Shell is running away, where else will the money come from. And this is a challenge for the service contractors. We do know that there should be active collaborations by the service contractors.\u201d\n\nTombomieye argued that though many players within the industry liked to cut corners, with the advent of the PIA, that would soon stop. He said major investments would start rolling in by 2022 as pending disputes are being resolved.\n\nDuring the event, the NCDMB Executive Secretary, Wabote, formally signed a deal with Amal Technologies for the setting up a state-of-the-art factory to produce hardware, embedded systems, and other technological devices in Nigeria. He said the plant could produce as much as two million electricity meters.\n\nWabote stated, \u201cThe plant will produce smart gas/smoke detector alarm devices that monitor and detect smoke and all types of gas leakages (especially LPG), call the user\u2019s mobile phone if the intensity of the gas is getting high, and automatically shut off the valve of the gas cylinder using Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence technology.\u201d\n\nOn the board\u2019s 10-year roadmap, Wabote said while there was a total of 96 initiatives, 56 were on track, 24 were on-going, 16 initiatives were not yet due, while overall, 75 per cent of the roadmap was on-track as at November 2021.\n\nAccording to Wabote, \u201cFive areas monitored for evaluation of Nigerian content are engineering, procurement, fabrication, project management, and services. Based on projects covered by our monitoring and evaluation directorate, a total of $20.4 billion was spent on these five categories between 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThe top three industries\u2019 spend are $8.07 billion on fabrication, representing 39 per cent of spend; $4.74billion on engineering services, representing 23 per cent of spending, and $5.67 billion on procurement of manufactured materials representing 28 per cent of spend.\n\n\u201cThe low spends were $1.18 billion on services, representing six per cent of spend, and $746 million on project management, representing four per cent of spend.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Sylva called for closer collaboration among the various agencies of the ministry with implementation of the PIA about to come into force. He said the conference had continued to grow every year, adding that the NCDMB had consistently broken new grounds with the implementation of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act.\n\nHe enjoined the board to continue its upward trajectory and stay focused on the implementation of the Nigerian Content 10-Year Strategic Roadmap to grow Nigerian content to the targeted level of 70 per cent by 2027.\n\nWabote said, \u201cGovernment expects that with the PIA now in place and supported by the enabling structures to ease doing business, new Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) should begin to happen rapidly in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWith over $42 billion worth of investment agreement signed by various Nigerian entities at the just concluded Intra African Trade Fair (IATF) in South Africa, there is strong optimism that so many new projects would soon commence in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nKomolafe, in his comments read by the Senior Technical Adviser NUPRC, Mr. Abel Nsa, said over a decade since the enactment of the NOGICD Act, so much had been achieved by the NCDMB over the years in the development of indigenous capacity. He said this had helped in stimulating the local economy and brought about the resurgence of new businesses, creation of jobs for the youth and unemployed, in addition to the retention of wealth in the country.\n\nShell Chair in Nigeria said the company in 2016 spent over N2 billion in the construction, upgrade and provision of equipment for the Nigerian Institute of Welding (NIW) in a bid to enhance welding technology in-country.\n\n\u201cWith this investment, the institute is now able to perform destructive and non-destructive testing of materials in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDiri urged the stakeholders to create \u201clocal contentment\u201d, to foster a conducive environment for the operations of the oil companies.\n\nShell MD, Okunbor Urges Nigeria to Optimise Energy Resources\n\nOkunbor said Nigeria should adopt a two-pronged strategy for its energy transition programme in response to global calls for reduction in the exploitation of fossil fuels and production of Green House Gases (GHG).\n\nOkunbor spoke while delivering the 51st Founders\u2019 Day Lecture of the University of Benin, titled, \u201cThe Global Energy Transition and The Imperatives for Nigeria.\u201d He called for an urgent optimisation of Nigeria\u2019s energy resources for speedy economic and industrial development of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria has gas in abundance \u2013 around 202 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves and about 600 trillion cubic feet of unproven reserves. Harnessing these vast gas resources, and on time too, is key in the next decade of Nigeria\u2019s existence.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the second approach for Nigeria\u2019s successful energy transition would be an intentional growth of the off-grid power and renewables industry taking advantage of foreign financial support and technology transfer.\n\nOkunbor stated, \u201cThe on-going energy transition is here with us. As with other transitions, it is a journey that will involve multiple approaches, collective action and undoubtedly present new challenges and opportunities.\n\n\u201cNigeria is well positioned to ride the wave of the current energy transition with its abundance of natural fossil fuels and renewable solar energy. We need to move with a greater sense of urgency and a clear sense of direction.\u201d\n\nOkunbor, who is also the Managing Director of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), said, \u201cNigeria, as a country with abundant natural fossil fuel resources, cannot afford for international and multilateral agencies to stop funding the development of fossil fuels, particularly gas projects.\n\n\u201cThe transition is underway,\u201d Okunbor said, \u201cbut it will move at different paces and produce different outcomes in different countries, depending on local factors. Society, as a whole, faces a dual challenge to transition to a low-carbon energy future, dealing with how to manage the risk of climate change, while also extending the benefits of energy to everyone on the planet. This is a challenge that requires changes in the way energy is produced, used and made accessible to people.\u201d\n\nDespite the efforts at decarbonisation, Okunbor said oil and gas would remain in the energy mix for some decades to come. He said, \u201cThis is partly a consequence of the time needed for renewables to reach the necessary level of materiality. In part, it is also a consequence of the lack of substitution options in some parts of the economy. But the world will need to meet its energy needs at the same time as it tackles climate change.\u201d\n\nHe noted that to make the federal government\u2019s \u201dDecade of Gas\u201d agenda a success, the country would need to unlock the domestic gas-to-power value chain; accelerate infrastructure development; drive gas-based industrialisation; and deepen domestic liquefied petroleum gas penetration.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Lagos White Paper Rips Apart Panel\u2019s Report on #EndSARS",
          "text": "\u2022Accepts 11 of 32 recommendations, rejects one, agrees on six with modifications, sends 14 to FG\n\n\u2022\u201cThe inconsistencies and contradictions in the entire JPI report concerning the number of persons, who died at LTG on 20th October 2020, and their cause of death rendered the JPI\u2019s findings and conclusions thereon as totally unreliable and therefore unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu: We\u2019ll bring closure to the painful episode\n\nBy Segun James\n\nThe Lagos State Government, last night, released its much-awaited White Papers on the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry over alleged police brutality, especially, the October 20, 2020 incident at the Lekki toll plaza and ripped it apart.\n\nAccording to the White paper, of the 32 recommendations made by the panel on the Lekki toll gate shooting, the state government only accepted 11, rejected one outright, agreed on six, albeit with modifications, while 14, which fell outside its powers would be forwarded to the federal government for consideration.\n\nImportantly, the White Paper, which addressed each of the recommendations and passed a verdict, rejected claims that nine people died at the Lekki toll plaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who for the first time, reacted to the panel\u2019s report in a broadcast yesterday at the Lagos House, Ikeja, promised that his government would bring closure to the painful episode of the #EndSARS with the White Paper.\n\nBut the government, while disputing some of the claims in the report, insisted it was full of discrepancies, irregularities and inaccuracies with claims of deaths of victims, even when some paragraphs of the same report revealed different claims and assertion.\n\nIn the White Paper released by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, the government described as baffling, the report that nine protesters were killed during the protest, saying apart from listing out their names in tabular form on pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their deaths, adding that the names only sprang up at 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed, as No. 46, Nathaniel Solomon, who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother, who he alleged died at LTC, himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u201cRemarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abata Soloma, was then also listed as No 2 on the list of persons, who died at LTG. The only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43, on 21th October 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99). Furthermore, there was no shred of evidence regarding, who shot him.\n\n\u201cAnother substantial inconsistency in the JPI Report was the award of compensation to only one (1) out of the alleged nine (9), listed as \u2018deceased\u2019, which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the deaths of eight (8) other allegedly deceased persons on its list. See page 304 of the JPI Report,\u201d the White Paper stated.\n\nThe government also picked hole in the justification for the award of money to one Serah Ibrahim, saying she was neither a petitioner nor a claimant before the JPI.\n\n\u201cThe JPI also surprisingly awarded the sum of N10m to one Serah Ibrahim (listed as No. 14 on Page 304 of the Report). Serah Ibrahi was neither a Petitioner nor a Claimant before the JPI. At Page 179 of the report, Serah Ibrahim testified on oath that she did not have any petition before the panel, neither did she have any claims for compensation.\n\n\u201cThis award to Serah Ibrahim is also contrary to the provisions of Section 13, Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015 (Cap. T6 La of Lagos State), which prescribes that only witnesses requested summoned by a Tribunal of Inquiry are entitled to witness fees subject to consent of the Attorney General. Serah Ibrahim did not testify at the request or summons of the Tribunal. See pages 17-18 of the report for the list of summoned witnesses,\u201d the paper stated.\n\nOn what it considered as fundamental inconsistencies in the findings of the JPI regarding the nine (9) deaths at LTG, the state government maintained that it rejected the claim, because the finding were clearly and manifestly not supported by evidence.\n\nThe government added that the JPI attested to the fact that there was nothing contrary to that of Professor Obafunwa, that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds on 21st October, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe JPI\u2019s finding of nine (9) deaths is, therefore, irreconcilable with the evidence of Prof. Obafunwa, that only one (1) person died of gunshot wounds at 7:43pm at LTG on 21stOctober, 2020.\n\n\u201cHaving held that there was no evidence before it to the contrary of what Prof. Obafunwa said, the question is, where did the JPI then get its finding of nine (9) deaths? (see table at pages 297-298).\n\n\u201cIt also follows the irresistible conclusions to be drawn from the JPI\u2019s acceptance of Prof. Obafunwa\u2019s testimony that only one (1) person died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 21stOctober 2020 is that there was no massacre at LTG, contextual or otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe findings of the JPI that nine (9) people died at LTG on 21st October 2020 from gunshots fired by the military are based on assumptions speculations.\n\n\u201cThe inconsistencies and contradictions in the entire JPI report concerning the number of persons, who died at LTG on 20th October 2020, and their cause of death rendered the JPI\u2019s findings and conclusions thereon as totally unreliable and therefore unacceptable.\u201d\n\nFurther on other recommendations, the Lagos government said, it has no control over the internal affairs of the Nigeria Police Force, and that the recommendation would be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, namely the federal government of Nigeria, National Economic Council, Police Service Commission and Nigeria Police Force.\n\nGovernment, however, promised to set up a separate statewide Helpline for human rights abuses in addition to its existing Emergency Toll-Free (767 & 112) Helplines, assuring the people that the recommendations would also be forwarded to the National Economic Council.\n\nSpecifically, on police brutality, the government said out of the 22 recommendations, it would only accept four and forward 18 to the federal government, three of which overlap and have also been accepted.\n\nThe state government further added that it lacked the powers to investigate and fish out police officers as recommended by the JPI at pages 249-254 of the report.\n\nHowever, speaking yesterday, Sanwo-Olu, who sounded emotional in his broadcast and seemed willing to put the matter behind him as quickly as possible, noted that though he believed in the credibility of the panel members to have appointed them for the assignment, their work as well as the eventual leakage of the report had only reopened deep wound.\n\nWhile promising that the decision of his government would be based entirely on the law, the weight of evidence and an unblemished respect for the truth, the governor also invited some of the youths, who were actively involved in the protests for a peace walk to herald the \u201chealing of Lagos\u201d.\n\nSanwo-Olu spoke in a broadcast held at the State House, Alausa, on the government\u2019s position on the panel\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cI will start by saying that we, as an administration, are determined that the next steps that will be taken in this process of coming to terms with the events of October 2020, must bring closure to a painful episode in the history of our State, with the release of the White Paper later today. This, in my view, is a moment that beckons us to define who and what we are as a people,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, the governor explained that, \u201cIt is with great sense of responsibility that I address you today on the reactions that have trailed the release of the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry Report submitted to me two weeks ago, and how it has played out in public discourse since then.\n\n\u201cI believe \u2014 and have always been vocal about this \u2014 that we owe it to you, the people of Lagos, to constantly speak and engage with you. In easy times, in difficult circumstances, we will never shy away from making our case to you, while also ensuring that we listen to you.\n\n\u201cTo be a Centre of Excellence, we must be a Centre of Truth. To be a smart city, we first must be a just one. To be a prosperous state, we must establish ourselves as a peaceful entity. And to achieve the Greater Lagos of our dreams, we must learn to live in harmony, even amidst inevitable disagreement.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu also said, in times like these, \u201cwith anger and animosity too quick and fast at hand, it is easy to hide behind our own prejudices, treating them as deeper truths instead of the superficial lies they are.\n\n\u201cIt is far too easy to take sides and choose emotion over fact, even when the truth is to be found in shades of nuances. It is easy to choose darkness over light; to take perverse delight in playing unhelpful games of cynicism and suspicion; to cling to beliefs that do not carry the weight of verifiable evidence.\n\n\u201cTo become a champion of prejudice is to own a fleeting and false victory. It is a victory of rancour over reason, of vengeance over justice, of anger over compassion. Today, I stand before you to declare that I reject this path; and I invite you all to do same.\u201d\n\nFor some important context, he claimed that there were certain things the people must never lose sight of, recalling that the Judicial Panel of Inquiry was originally inaugurated to investigate allegations of police brutality committed by the disbanded SARS in the state.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of what happened on October 20, 2020, I decided to expand the mandate of the Panel to include investigating what really happened at the Lekki Tollgate that night. As a matter of good faith and a sincere commitment to uncovering the truth, we constituted a panel of individuals that we believed were independent, credible, and representative of the various stakeholder community interested in the movement against police brutality.\n\n\u201cApart from the Chairman of the panel being a respected retired jurist, various stakeholders including the youths, #EndSARS protesters, the police and civil society groups were represented on the panel. I am sure no member of the panel can claim that the state government made any attempt to influence them in any way throughout the duration of its sitting.\n\n\u201cWhile I commend the panel for undertaking its task to the best of its abilities, it is however regrettable that the panel\u2019s work and the leakage of an unauthorised version of the report have generated much tension. Sadly, a deep wound has been reopened.\n\n\u201cThe heated exchanges among various shades of opinion on the report have unfortunately put us all at the risk of missing the larger picture; the fact that what we all seek in common is a land in which we are all safe and secure, law enforcement agents are trusted, and justice is guaranteed for all.\u201d\n\nThe governor reiterated that he had no intention to engage in histrionics or further inflame passion on a matter that had generated intense interest and controversy nationally and internationally, but maintained that, \u201cOur decisions and actions will be based entirely on the law, the weight of evidence and an unblemished respect for the truth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI have never been in any doubt as to the sincerity, patriotism and noble motivations of both organisers of and participants in the movement to see an end to the human rights abuses by the now disbanded Special Anti- Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\n\u201cIt is also on record that the federal government accepted all the demands of the protesters, including the immediate scrapping of SARS. The National Economic Council (NEC) also recommended the establishment of State Panels of Inquiry into cases of police brutality. And the Lagos State Government was the first to set up its own panel.\n\n\u201cI can boldly say that no state took the advocacy for police reforms and justice in the face of documented brutality more seriously than we did in Lagos. We have so far paid N420million in compensation to victims of police brutality, in line with the recommendations of the panel.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu further recalled that, in solidarity with the protesters, \u201cI joined our youths at various points during the demonstrations, particularly at the Lekki Tollgate and Alausa. I received the charter of demands of the protesters and promised to pass them on to the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cI kept my word and passed on the demands to the President, who promised to act promptly on the issues raised. However, perhaps as a result of entrenched lack of trust between the government and the governed over the years, the protesters responded to the government\u2019s concessions with skepticism, and the demonstrations continued, even growing in intensity.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu acknowledged that what had been \u201cwell organised and peaceful protests were subsequently hijacked in different parts of the country, particularly in Lagos. In the ensuing descent into anarchy, many of our compatriots were caught up in the violence. Several policemen were killed. Public and private property, including critical infrastructure, were set on fire, leading to losses estimated at several billions of naira,\u201d forcing the imposition of a curfew.\n\nWhile hoping that everyone, including the government, the youth, protesters, the police, and other security agencies, would have learned the appropriate lessons from the #EndSARSprotests, particularly the Lekki Tollgate incident, with a view to averting a recurrence, he said \u201cIt is a testimony to our strength and resilience as a people that, despite the huge losses incurred because of these terrible incidents, we have bounced back, with our economy as vibrant and virile as ever.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Sanwo-Olu said he would be leading \u2018A WALK FOR PEACE\u2019 this December to \u201cherald the healing of our land. Let me use this occasion to extend an open invitation to our youths, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society groups, students and the media as well as other stakeholders to join me.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, however, identified such individuals as Folarin Falana (Falz), Debo Adebayo (Mr. Marcaroni), Dele Farotimi, Temitope Majekodunmi, Segun Awosanya (Segalinks), Adetoun (Just Detoun), Seun Kuti, CP Hakeem Odumosu and CSP Yinka Egbeyemi as some of those he would like to have join him on the historic march for Lagos.\n\n\u201cNobody will build this city for us. Let us show the world who we are. We are Lagosians \u2013 a people of great renown, driven by the irrepressible spirit of Lagos,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria\u2019s lawmakers urge NCDC to step up national response\n\nChinedu Eze in Lagos and Udora Orizu in Abuja with agency report\n\nCanada yesterday banned travellers from Nigeria, Egypt, and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant, bringing to 10 the number of African countries targeted by Ottawa, according to the AFP.\n\nThis is just as members of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives at plenary yesterday, mandated the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to step up national response to control the emergence and spread of new COVID-19 omicron variant in order to spare Nigeria the full brunt of the third wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cForeign nationals who have transited or stayed in these 10 countries cannot enter Canada if they have been in those countries in the last two weeks,\u201d the AFP quoted Canadian Health Minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, to have said at a press conference.\n\nHe also said all air travelers arriving from outside Canada, apart from the United States, would now need to be tested for Covid-19 at their point of entry, \u201cwhether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated,\u201d and that those travelers would need to isolate until their test results are available.\n\nFirst reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) less than a week ago after being detected in southern Africa earlier in November, the Omicron variant has already appeared in several countries, stoking global fears about a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than five million people and savaged economies worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is not over,\u201d Transport Minister Omar Alghabra added. \u201cTravel measures could change at any moment.\u201d\n\nCanada on Friday banned entry to all travelers from seven southern African countries: Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Canada confirmed it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain, in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.\n\nCanada however, has no direct flight with Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the House of Representatives have also mandated the NCDC to ensure intensive observation and check on travel protocols for inbound passengers.\n\nIt further mandated the Federal Ministry of Health to mandate the COVID-19 Task Force to immediately activate strategies to be implemented in monitoring adherence to COVID-19 guidelines and ensure residents continue to comply with all advisories aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe resolutions of the lawmakers were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau).\n\nMoving the motion, Bagos said the House was aware that on November 26th, 2021 a new, heavily mutated COVID-19 variant named Omicron was discovered in South Africa and had spread across the globe on Sunday, shutting borders and renewing curbs as the EU chief said governments faced a \u201crace against time\u201d to understand.\n\nHe said the House was also aware that on November 26, 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron, on the advice of WHO\u2019s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).\n\nThis decision, he noted was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.\n\nHe expressed concerns that Canada said on Sunday it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain of COVID in two people who had travelled recently to Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the NCDC, said it was monitoring emerging evidence on Omicron variant and its implication, to inform Nigeria\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe government of Ontario confirmed that the two cases are In the Capital, Ottawa and also preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become re-infected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern.\n\n\u201cConcerned that a total of 126 genomes of this variant have been detected globally and published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data, and there seem to be a high number of mutations present in the Omicron variant and the exponential rise suggesting the virus to be highly transmissible and may also present an increased risk of reinfection compared to other variant of concern (VOC).\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Henry Nwawuba (PDP, Imo) opined that the provisions which the controversial infectious diseases Bill sought to achieve is playing out today.\n\nHe said the government should be proactive and not wait for other countries to take actions that will affect Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to raise the consciousness of Nigerians on the Omicron variant of COVID-19 which has led to travel restrictions placed in some countries. Last year this house moved for the control of infectious diseases bill at the time there was an outcry saying that the bill was draconian and the house was overstepping its boundary, that we are giving too much power to the NCDC.\n\n\u201cAll those things that we proposed in the infectious diseases bill that led to the outcry have happened in the world today. Today there are travel restrictions, vaccine mandate, everything we did is playing out today. The truth about COVID-19 is that we have to be proactive. We can\u2019t sit back and wait.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "And on Sunday, Canada confirmed it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain, in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.\nMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the House of Representatives have also mandated the NCDC to ensure intensive observation and check on travel protocols for inbound passengers.\nHe noted that the NCDC, said it was monitoring emerging evidence on Omicron variant and its implication, to inform Nigeria\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHe said the government should be proactive and not wait for other countries to take actions that will affect Nigeria.\n\u201cI want to raise the consciousness of Nigerians on the Omicron variant of COVID-19 which has led to travel restrictions placed in some countries.",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Micheal Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Are Ugandan telcos equipped to protect user data?",
          "text": "A recent report from Unwanted Witness, a Uganda-based civil society organisation, reveals that two years on from the implementation of Uganda\u2019s Data Protection and Privacy Act, the nation\u2019s tech companies are still struggling with compliance.\n\nTelecommunication operators are at the core of Uganda\u2019s digital development, and yet are among the worst offenders on privacy violations, raising questions about their ability to protect sensitive user data.\n\nLaw in action\n\nUganda implemented its first codified legislation on data protection, the Data Protection, and Privacy Act, in 2019. The act, which establishes principles surrounding the protection, collection, and storage of customers\u2019 personal data, designates the National Information Technology Authority \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) as the official regulator for data protection in the country and lays out penalties for violators.\n\nSince its implementation, Uganda\u2019s core data privacy act has proven to be an effective regulator, to some extent.\n\nIn 2020, Unwanted Witness investigated motorcycle ride-hailing startup Safeboda\u2019s compliance with data privacy regulations in the country. Their findings revealed that the company was not only guilty of using a privacy policy that did not comply with Uganda\u2019s data protection standards but also using a third-party tracker called CleverTap. When asked about its use of CleverTap, Safeboda\u2019s Chief Financial Officer claimed it was for \u201ctracking marketing communication and identifying product issues\u201d.\n\nThough no punitive measures were taken against Safeboda, the NITA-U did publish a report on its own investigation into the company\u2019s practices in early 2021. The regulator concluded that Safeboda was, in fact, in violation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and ordered the company to address \u201call areas of non-compliance\u201d over a four-month period.\n\nTelecom offenders\n\nWhile the work of Unwanted Witness and Uganda\u2019s Data Privacy Act helped stop some of Safeboda\u2019s practices, Uganda\u2019s telecommunication operators are still among the worst offenders.\n\nThe Privacy Scorecard Report 2021 revealed that telecom operators in Uganda failed to give adequate information to data subjects, mention third-party sharing of personal data, and give information on the quantity of information shared.\n\nThis resulted in a low overall score of 35% for the industry when it came to data compliance.\n\nThese digital failures have real-life consequences.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Mukasa, CEO at Unwanted Witness, \u201cTelecom companies are the highest data collectors [in Uganda]\u201d, and they are still struggling to ensure that they protect individuals.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly dangerous in an environment where telecom companies occupy a fundamental position in a nation\u2019s economy and tech industry.\n\nThe number of mobile subscribers in Uganda is rapidly on the rise, increasing by 21,200% from 2000\u20132020. As mobile subscriptions have grown, telcos in Uganda have also received new access to personal information from Ugandan citizens.\n\nIn 2018, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) issued new SIM card validation guidelines that required telcos to verify a registered mobile number against a citizen\u2019s National Identification Number (NIN). The regulation was meant to tackle fraud and crime, but, in the hands of telcos with suboptimal data privacy frameworks, it offered new capabilities for exploitation.\n\nHacking\n\nSince the onset of COVID-19, the use of mobile money\u2014of which MTN and Airtel Uganda maintain a 90% share of the market\u2014has increased by around 12.7%.\n\nAlongside this jump in users has also been more frequent instances of cyber fraud aimed at telecom companies, revealing just how essential proper data management and protection is.\n\nA 2019 Uganda Police Annual Crime Report revealed a 25% increase in cybercrime over a one-year period, leading to a loss of around $11 million from SIM card swapping and hacking digital financial accounts.\n\nIn 2020, MTN and Airtel Uganda were forced to temporarily suspend mobile money operations after their systems were compromised by hackers. Unconfirmed reports estimate that billions of Ugandan shillings were lost in the breach.\n\nWhy tech offends\n\nBeyond the value that an application garners from its products and services is the data it collects. Generally, a tech company, in its early stages, is not profitable in the traditional sense. At this point, its value is, in part, based on the data the company has access to through its user base.\n\nOften, as in the case of Safeboda, tech companies add trackers and third-party software on top of their applications to process the data they collect. Updating users each and every time a company adds a new tracker and explaining exactly what that tracker does can be bad for business.\n\nWhen Apple rolled out a new update allowing customers to opt-out of data trackers used by social media platforms earlier this year, digital citizens leaped at the opportunity, resulting in an estimated loss of $9.85 billion in revenue by Snap, Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s case, the tech companies that operate there gather data on a traditionally underserved tech market where there is \u201clow awareness of the power that they have to change and control their personal data,\u201d according to Mukasa.\n\nThis leaves Uganda\u2019s digital citizens vulnerable to unscrupulous tech companies who \u201care exploiting the low levels of awareness among the population to be able to collect as much as they can,\u201d said Mukasa.\n\nCountries around the world whose tech industries developed faster than regulation could keep up with had to learn hard lessons about digital privacy.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) has embarked on a year-long campaign to rein in powerful tech companies the government feels have had unchecked access to user data for far too long.\n\nFacebook has also been in and out of courts in the US and UK over data privacy issues, since 2018.\n\nAs Uganda\u2019s tech industry continues to develop, it too will have to contend with the benefits and costs of tech development.\n\nWhile this is going on, monitoring and evaluation by independent, civil society organisations like Unwanted Witness will become more important than ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "High prices pinch Nigerians amid slowing inflation",
          "text": "Inflation rate has slowed for seven straight months but Nigerians still feel the pinch with ravaging hunger levels and rising poverty.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s latest Nigeria Development Update report, inflation has pushed 8 million Nigerians into poverty between 2020 and November 2021. This is an increase from 7 million reported in June 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, before inflation started rising steadily from September 2019, there were 83 million poor Nigerians, but the number has risen to 91 million as a result of price shock.\n\nAt 15.99 percent in October 2021, Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate is far from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s desired 6-9 percent range.\n\nEconomic output in Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer has lagged the pace of population expansion of about 2.6 per every year since 2015, a sign of worsening poverty levels.\n\nIdowu, a housekeeper, told BusinessDay that her children have dropped out of school and they now find it hard to eat twice a day now.\n\nThe widowed mother of four explained they used to eat three times a day, but no longer afford that due to the rapid increase in the prices of food items.\n\nRead Also: For first time in 2yrs, Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate slows for second straight month\n\nExperts say a decline in inflation rate is not an indication that prices have dropped.\n\n\u201cWhen they say inflation rate is coming down, what is coming down is the rate at which prices are growing. It is not that prices are coming down, Omotola Abimbola, a macro-economist at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham said.\n\n\u201cIf inflation rate is 14 percent today and it came down from 15 percent last month, it doesn\u2019t mean prices have come down by 1 percent, it only means that the rate at which prices are going up has moderated from 15 percent to 14 percent,\u201d Abimbola said.\n\nOlaolu Boboye, an economist analyst at Cardinal Stone also explained that prices are still rising but at a slower pace.\n\n\u201cThe only time you see inflation numbers translating to what you have in the market in terms of decline is when you have continuous moderation in prices over an extended period of time, that is when you will begin to see the impact and this isn\u2019t immediate, it takes a while,\u201d Boboye said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s failed border closure policy which kicked off in August 2019 as a strategy to boost local production yielded little gains as inflation began rising steadily from September 2019.\n\nInflation inched down from 11.1 percent in July 2019 to 11.02 percent in August 2019, the lowest reading since January 2016 but rose to 11.24 percent in September 2019 and continued to rise till April 2021 when it hit 17.33 percent.\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest economy has also struggled to overcome a more than decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast and bandit attacks in the northwest that have disrupted farming and displaced millions. This is also weighing on productivity and causing price increase.\n\nThe new Omicron variant has exacerbated inflation uncertainty in many parts of the world as the Covid-19 variant could intensify supply-chain disruptions.\n\n\u201cIf the Omicron virus becomes worse particularly in Nigeria, we are likely to find more sanctions in terms of travel ban in Nigeria and that could impact imported food inflation,\u201d Philip Anegbe, head of research at CardinalStone said.\n\n\u201cHowever, what will really affect our inflation is the impact that will force the government to impose internal restrictions. This is more important because if we look at how food inflation is measured, it is mainly internally produced foodstuff, so if the government imposes domestic restrictions like they did last year, then we expect inflation to jump,\u201d Anegbe said.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria has the 7th highest inflation rate in Africa, and it is one of the few countries where inflation rose as incomes fell.\n\nThe Global Hunger Index report also ranks Nigeria as the 103rd of 116 countries, indicating that hunger is severe in the country and may become alarming if nothing is done about this urgently.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way to do long-term reforms that can ensure that we have an inflation rate moderate in a permanent way to a single digit. These reforms have to be structural because Nigeria\u2019s inflation problem is structural in nature which is basically cost-push, particularly in the food sector value chain,\u201d Omotola said.\n\nHe also pointed out that Nigeria needs to raise agriculture productivity, solve insecurity challenges and invest more in infrastructure.\n\nThe World Bank has also recommended that to reduce the inflation rate, Nigeria must remove FX restrictions on imports of staple foods and medicines in the next three to six months.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) was forced to move the November 24 deadline for the submission of bid and payment of the ten percent fee of $20 million after it emerged that only MTN Nigeria had complied with the requirement, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nA day before the deadline expired, air traffic controllers had gone on strike, and it was feared that telecommunications chiefs mainly based in Lagos would have been unable to fly to Abuja to submit physical copies of the bid documents to the NCC offices in the federal capital.\n\nBy Monday, November 29, when the new deadline expired, MTN, Airtel and MASAB Communications Ltd had paid the required $19.74 million fee for participation in the auction.\n\nOur reporter learnt that officials of NCC were afraid of having a repeat of what happened when the 2600 spectrum was auctioned with only MTN showing interest. That would have meant a loss of income for the commission if only MTN alone turned up for the bid for the 5G licence which has a reserve price of $197.4 million per lot.\n\nAlthough the information memorandum issued by the NCC contained a clause that allows the Commission to amend the content, some in the industry have said the deadline extension sends the wrong signals.\n\nRead Also: NCC sets December for 5G spectrum auction\n\nThis is not the only matter setting tongues wagging about the auction. The leading telecoms companies had been expected to stay away from the 5G auction because of the high price given as they claimed, there has yet been a business case established for 5G in Nigeria where even the largest networks do not have more than 40 per 4G coverage. BusinessDay learnt that MTN and Airtel are joining in the auction simply because of positioning and not for the presence of a strong business case.\n\nNCC is making only two licences available in the upcoming auction while it is hoping to clean up another three in two years\u2019 time.\n\nIn addition to the high price, there is little known about the third company, MASAB Communications, a hitherto unknown owner of an interconnect licence and which also operates an international direct link business.\n\nOn its website NCC said it moved the deadline \u201cdue to the challenges posed to air travels as witnessed recently and considering that it may have some impact on intending bidders regarding the submission of their bids, the Commission hereby extends the deadline for submission of bids and Initial Bid Deposits (IBDs) to 5.00 pm on Monday, November 29, 2021.\u201d",

          "text": "Several airlines have cancelled flights from Canada and Nigeria following the decision of Canada to add Nigeria to its travel ban list.\n\nIn addition, travel agents operating in Nigeria may see an almost 20 percent decline in ticket sales as a result of the development.\n\nA few hours after the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, (NCDC), confirmed the first three cases of Omicron variant in travellers from South Africa who arrived in Nigeria, Canada on Wednesday added Nigeria to the \u2018travel ban\u2019 list.\n\n\u201cThere will be massive flight delays because Canada is one of our top selling destinations. We will experience close to a 20 percent decline in sales as a result of the ban on the destination but we are hopeful that it will be a temporary restriction and it should not last more than two weeks.\n\n\u201cIf it goes beyond that, many families will be frustrated. I hope other destinations do not copy what Canada is doing because if they do, we are doomed for it,\u201d Bankole Bernard, former president, National Associations of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA) told BusinessDay.\n\nBernard said many people had already bought tickets for Christmas and others were planning to buy tickets before the development.\n\n\u201cI thought Nigeria was supposed to have learnt its lessons by now. We are always reactive instead of being proactive,\u201d he added.\n\nSteve Iduh is the managing partner of A.D & Partners, a firm specialising in global citizenship and residency programmes told BusinessDay that if the ban on the Nigerian route causes the embassy to stop issuing visas to Canada, it means his firm will have to suspend citizenship programmes to Canada.\n\nIduh said the travel ban only affects passengers originating from Nigeria but it will not affect Nigerians travelling from other countries where the travel ban does not exist.\n\nHe however said he is hopeful that the ban may not take long as governments are working with their scientists to put things under control.\n\nRead also: Omicron variant: Canada adds Nigeria to travel ban list\n\n\u201cI was planning to relocate to Canada with my family before the travel ban. This is so difficult to handle as we have sold almost everything in Nigeria as we prepared to relocate in two weeks\u2019 time,\u201d a traveller who craved anonymity told BuisnessDay.\n\nBuisnessDay\u2019s checks show that people are already cancelling their engagements and asking airlines for refunds on tickets bought.\n\nTravel agents also told BusinessDay that the airlines have been cooperating and refunds are being made to travellers seamlessly.\n\nCecile Doumbe, managing director of CMD Tours told BusinessDay that the new COVID variant is already impacting her business as sales are low and hotels are not realising many requests.\n\n\u201cSales were beginning to pick up during the end of 2020 to 2021 but now with the new variant, I am scared we are going back to lockdown because countries have started shutting down again. We are having a lot of cancellations.\n\n\u201cWe are just hoping that the lockdown is for a short period and they would have time to sort out the issues at hand. It may not be that long. Right now, we can\u2019t predict. I want to applaud the airlines because they are refunding people and it is encouraging,\u201d Doumbe said.\n\nBefore now, Nigerians migrating to Canada have increased following the worsening economic hardship and impact of Covid-19.\n\nImmigration experts have said the exodus of Nigerian immigrants to Canada is showing no signs of slowing down because of the current economic situation of the country.\n\nExperts also say Canada offers high-quality education and the country is immigration friendly, thereby pushing several Nigerians seeking greener pastures to the country.\n\nFor the fifth year in a row, more Nigerians migrated to Canada than the year before as data published by the Canadian government shows the number of Nigerians issued permanent resident permits has tripled since 2015.\n\nIts growth rate outstrips some of Canada\u2019s biggest sources of immigrants over the last five years, including India, China and the Philippines.\n\nThe rise in Nigerian migrants heading to Canada defects the North American country\u2019s push to expand its labour force and lower the average age of its workers as its population advances in years. In 2019, Canada welcomed 341,000 immigrants in total (about 10,000 more it targeted) as part of immigration policy to attract skilled workers.",

Faruk Yahaya on Wednesday said that he had approved the production of 10,000 units of RICKSHAW Combat Tactical Vests for effective operations of the Nigerian Army (NA).\n\nYahaya said this through the Chief of Logistics, Maj.-Gen. Anthony Akintade at the two-day 2021 Corps Commander Ordnance Annual Conference holding at the Headquarters, Nigerian Army Ordnance Corps (NAOC), Abalti Barracks, Lagos State.\n\nThe conference with theme: \u2018Repositioning Nigerian Army Ordnance Corps in Providing Effective Service Delivery Towards Sustaining Nigerian Army Assigned Missions.\u2019 will hold from Dec. 1 to Dec. 2.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the RICKSHAW Combat Tactical Vests is produced by the NAOC and it contains a kit bag, fragmental jacket, map case, radio holder and a pistol carrier.\n\nYahaya said that the continuous dependence on imported military hardware in the face of dwindling national economy was impracticable with adverse effect on all operations.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the NAOC has recently been mandated to produce RICKSHAW Combat Tactical Vests through its Kit Factory for the NA.\n\n\u201cThis mutually benefiting option can in the long run, guarantee availability of adequate logistics for NA commitments at moderate cost to the government with a resultant boost in the national economy.\n\n\u201cThe NA is therefore being ingenious in looking inwards to improve the availability of robust logistics for its numerous operations and other commitments,\u201d the COAS said.\n\nHe said that the NA was also partnering with local industries to source for logistics items ranging from vehicles including Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to wide range of clothing stores among others.\n\n\u201cThe EZUGWU MRAP is a glowing testimony of the NA\u2019s quest towards self-sufficiency.\n\n\u201cI assure my unwavering support to all ingenious efforts toward providing effective service delivery and logistics to the NA in all its operations,\u201d Yahaya said.\n\nThe COAS said that the NA was currently involved in several joint operations to tackle security challenges in the country such as insurgency, terrorism, kidnapping, pipeline vandalism among others.\n\nAccording to him, the NA has significantly degraded the ranks of terrorists, insurgents, vandals and other miscreants thereby engendering relative peace across the country.\n\n\u201cThese successes have been made possible by the conduct of Operation KANTANA JIMLAN, FIRE BALL 1 and 2 and TURA TAKAIBANGO.\n\n\u201cAlso, various ongoing exercises across the country such as Ex STILL WATER, Ex NUTCRACKER 2, Ex ENDURING PEACE and Ex DELTA DAWN among others have recorded significant successes.\n\n\u201cThese operations and exercises have placed very high demand on logistics through the facilitation of robust force projection to tackle the challenges,\u201d Yahaya said.\n\nThe COAS expressed his gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for his strategic guidance and unrelenting support to the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cI must remind Commanders at all levels to continue to provide requisite leadership and ensure that their personnel are continually reminded of the need to always uphold the tenets of military professionalism,\u201d Yahaya said.\n\nNAN also reports that a free medical outreach was provided to the families of Ordnance personnel, the neighbouring community and all participants.\n\nA newly remodelled NAOC Officers\u2019 Mess was also commissioned as well as a ground breaking ceremony for two new blocks of Officers\u2019 transit accommodation.\n\n...",

We are providing our people with an oasis of hope even with the harsh realities that confront us as a sub-national in a country that is confronted by a number of developmental challenges,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nOn the achievements in the outgoing year, Obaseki said, \u201cIn 2021, even with the harsh economic realities, our government reached a number of milestones in our quest to deliver good governance to Edo people. Although we were faced with the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic and the shocks from its attendant impact on the economy as well as other headwinds, we judiciously managed the lean resources available to us to initiate and continue investments in human capital, infrastructure upgrade, enhance productivity in the business space and foster economic rejuvenation.\n\n\u201cIn the outgoing year, we implemented an expansive institutional transformation exercise, which is aimed at retooling, unbundling, restructuring and energizing the systems and personnel in government to adapt and deploy bespoke practices to enhance service delivery.\n\n\u201cWe launched the Edo State Public/Civil Service Transformation Program (EdoSTEP) to institutionalise and monitor this process, just as continuous in-service capacity enhancement programmes are ongoing at the John Odigie-Oyegun Public Service Academy.\u201d\n\nReviewing the gains recorded in the education sector, the governor noted, \u201cChildren in primary schools in Edo State today now learn three times more than they used to learn with the old pedagogue. The World Bank has acknowledged this consequential progress we have made in addressing Foundational Literacy and Numeracy defects in our students. Edo today is ranked as one of the five nationals and sub-nationals in the world leading the charge in tackling learning poverty. We have the lowest number of out-of-school children in Nigeria on account of our reforms.\n\n\u201cThe EdoBEST 2.0 has been launched, through which not less than 300 junior secondary schools are being migrated to the EdoBEST platform, to sustain gains made in the past few years.\n\n\u201cAt the tertiary education level, the Edo State College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Iguoriakhi and its sister campuses are being upgraded to global standard,\u201d he added.\n\nFor the healthcare sector, Obaseki said, \u201cWe have built a more resilient system involving all relevant stakeholders in the Edo State Healthcare system to respond to challenges faced with the outbreak of the COVID-19 crises.\n\n\u201cWith the health insurance scheme now operational, we are building a superstructure to provide a strong capital base for the sustenance of the healthcare system, while providing our people with a more democratized system of accessing quality and affordable healthcare.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cMr. Speaker, we have completed construction and have secured the accreditation of the world-class Edo State College of Nursing Sciences, a model tertiary education institution that has been primed to produce top-of-the-range health personnel.\n\n\u201cThe CCETC Clean Energy/Ossiomo Independent Power Plant (IPP) is now operational and powering government buildings in Benin City, including Government House, the State Secretariat complex, Specialist Hospital, Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, among others. The operation \u2018Light up Edo State\u2019 is also ongoing.\n\n\u201cWhile the landmark Edo Modular Refinery project has been completed and set to commence operations, the Edo State Oil Palm Programme has been activated, with 50,000-hectares of land being cultivated by investors in oil palm plantations.\n\n\u201cWe are at the verge of completing construction of the Benin City Central Bus Terminal, at the Obakhavbaye axis of Ring Road, and have acquired the portion of land stretching from the terminal to Oba Market, for a grander development to cater for 1,000 vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Geographic Information Service (EDOGIS) has successfully installed a Continuous Operating Reference Station (CORS) to upgrade surveying, mapping and GPS applications in the State. It has also acquired a fixed-wing VTOL drone and a vehicle-mounted mobile mapper to enhance its operations in land administration in the state.\n\n\u201cWe have, in the last one year, awarded contracts for over 150 road projects spread across the three senatorial districts of the state. These include roads linking towns as well as small township and inner-city roads. While work is ongoing, our contractors have had to grapple with the adverse impact of the rainy season.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who reeled out achievements of his administration in innovation and youth enterprise, noted, \u201cWorking with our partners, we have launched the Edo Tech Park take-off campus, from where we are kicking- off the training of not less than 15,000 youths in the next five years in software engineering and soft skills. A batch from the Edo campus has already graduated and is set to take on the world to build tech unicorns from our state.\n\n\u201cThe Victor Uwaifo Creative Hub, another landmark project, is fitted with a world-class soundstage and a post-production studio, fitted with equipment for production, printing, animation and post-production, giving a fillip to our state\u2019s creative sector.\u201d\n\nReceiving the 2022 budget proposal, Speaker Edo State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Marcus Onobun assured the Governor that the legislative arm will continue to work harmoniously with the executive to ensure socio-economic growth and development of the State.\n\n...",

There are lots of factors militating against the maritime industry in Nigeria, including lack of infrastructure like scanners to speed up cargo examination by Customs and other government agencies.\u201d\n\nThe ANLCA boss however criticised the duplicity of functions by agencies of government at the industry, which he identified as one of the drawbacks.\n\nHe also identified other challenges which include the perennial traffic gridlock along the ports access roads, lack of functional railway system for immediate evacuation of containers out of the port, activities of miscreants within the port corridors, corruption and sabotage in the system.\n\n\u201cNumerous agencies of governments at the seaport are carrying out similar functions. Perennial traffic gridlock is hindering easy access to the seaport; including poor road network within the port vicinity\u201d.\n\nIn his welcome address, the President of AMJON, Mr. Paul Ogbuokiri said the apologized for the failure of 2020 edition which he attributed to the outbreak of Covid-19; and expressed confidence that the transport and logics chain industry unhappily slowed down by the virus will redouble their efforts at capacity performance.\n\nThe AMJON leader urged the Federal Government to complete the rehabilitation of the Lagos ports roads timely, and also enjoined the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency to recommit to their determination to raise the growth index and increase the tempo of sub regional competitiveness.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have noted that the leadership of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has commenced a campaign for the removal of the war risk insurance on Nigerian bound cargoes and is also inching closer to returning Nigerian to a position of importance in global maritime politics.\n\n\u201cIt has also come to our notice that the new leadership at the Nigerian Ports Authority has reworked the Electronic Truck Call System (ETO) to the extent that it brought down the notorious Apapa traffic gridlock by about 60 per cent. We\u2019re looking forward that this magic Wang will put traffic completely under control so that Apapa, Nigeria\u2019s foremost port city will regain its grove.\n\n\u201cTo this end we urge the Federal Government to ensure that the Nigerian ports access roads, particularly the about 10 kilometers Oshodi-Apapa expressway which has been under construction for more than 20 is completed as experts have said that completion of construction work on the road will reduce the Apapa gridlock by 40 per cent.\u201d\n\nPresident General of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, Comrade Adewale Adeyanju, Dr. Kayode Farinto, Hajia Bola Muse, General Manager, Lagos Operations, National Inland Waterways Authority, Engr. (Mrs) Sarat Braimoh, were among those honoured at the prestigious event by AMJON.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria has warned that no Christian should be killed in Zamfara State, just as it asked security agencies to protect all churches in the state and prevent terrorists from carrying out their threats against Christians.\n\nThe Association stated that the threat against Christians and churches by the terrorists is a divisive strategy against the effort of Christian and Muslim leaders towards ending criminalities in the North-West.\n\nCAN also called on the Department of State Security and the Inspector General of Police to investigate those who are speaking for the terrorists with a view to unmasking their sponsors and beneficiaries of their criminalities.\n\nThis was contained in a statement titled, \u2018No Christian Should Be Killed in Zamfara \u2013 CAN Warns,\u2019 signed by the General Secretary, CAN, Barr Joseph Bade Daramola.\n\nAccording to CAN, \u201cThe State Police Command has reportedly confirmed that a threat letter was sent to the Christians in the state asking them to stop worship and to close down churches or risk their violent attacks. We also learnt that it was the Police that even informed the state chapter of the Association about the threat.\n\n\u201cWe know that all kidnappings and other criminalities being perpetrated in the North-Western part of the country are the handiwork of terrorists who either migrated from the North-East or those who were released under the purported rehabilitation programme of the Federal government.\n\n\u201cNow that a Federal High Court has labelled those criminals terrorists, we call on the Police, the military authorities and other security agencies to rise up to the challenge of the terrorists who have turned kidnappings into the biggest business venture in the geopolitical zone.\n\n\u201cThe way and manner by which our security agencies have been handling those criminals are totally unacceptable, reprehensible and unprecedented. Criminals are criminals irrespective of their religious, political and ethnic affiliations and they should be treated as just. We also called on the Department of State Security and the Inspector General of Police to Investigate those who are speaking for the terrorists with a view to unmasking their sponsors and beneficiaries of their criminalities.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the national Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in our recent visit to Sokoto and Kebbi states was alarmed, surprised and shocked by the record of those criminals who are killing and kidnapping with impunity in the area as if there was a pact between them and the security agencies. Now that both the leaderships of Christianity and Islam in the country are working together on how to stop their criminalities in the Northwest, they are now trying to introduce divisive ways by declaring war against Christians and churches in the zone especially in Zamfara State where they are gradually turning into their strongholds.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem with Islam or with our Muslim brothers and sisters but with the handful fanatics and their financiers who have declared war against Christianity. We appeal to all peace-loving Muslims to speak against those who are painting Islam what is not. We know that there is no right-thinking Muslim leader who will be happy with the killings of Christians.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to sanction any Commissioner of Police or Zonal Police Commanders and the Director of State Security Services wherever kidnappers operate in the country henceforth. This will go a long way in reducing the menace as we are approaching the Yuletide season. We have never had it this bad. We also called on the Federal government to refund all the ransom paid for the release of those who were abducted in the last five years. We reiterate our quest for the State Police in order to reduce the security burden on the Federal government-controlled Police. The Police have been overwhelmed with the menace of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari should also direct the Police to arraign all suspected kidnappers, bandits and terrorists in their custody with a view to stopping those who are perpetrating the atrocities. Failure to do this will force the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to ask our members to embrace the principle of self-defence wherever the security agencies appeared compromised. Up till today, the perpetrators of the genocide in the Southern Kaduna are still walking freely despite the killings of hundreds of our members. We cannot be reduced to refugees in the country that belongs to us again.\n\n\u201cFinally, we call on all Christians and peace-loving Muslims to pray against their threats and for our security agencies to be able to stop all criminalities in the country.

Who are those to benefit more if it is indirect primaries. So, it is important that Nigerians should know why there should be electronic transmission of result in order to save our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the only way those in position of authority can become accountable to the people, is when electoral process is free and fair.\n\nHe maintained any electoral system that permits security agencies to be used to rig election, and for Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials to be manipulated, will not yield accountable governance.\n\nGovernor Wike commended the INEC for the successful conduct of the just concluded Anambra State governorship election.\n\n\u201cNow, they have performed well in Anambra State, everybody is praising them. But when they did not perform well in Rivers State, should we praise them? We cannot. When a general in the Army will convert a whole division to INEC office, will you be happy?\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike urged Nigerians to always deemphasize their ethnic and religious affiliation in order for the country to achieve the desired national cohesion.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for all of us to still believe that this country must be united. But, if we want to move forward, we must drop the issue of where you come from. We must drop the issue of where you worship. Overemphasis of these things cause a lot of disintegration and which is not the best for us.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who chaired the occasion, said the country is going through tough times.\n\nAccording to him, the current travails of the country also offers opportunities for the emergence of a great nation.\n\nThe guest speaker, Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah, who delivered the ThisNigeria inaugural lecture with the theme, \u2018National Cohesion for Sustainable Growth and Progress: The Nigeria Dilemma,\u2019 blamed the drafters of the Nigerian constitution for the country\u2019s lack of national cohesion.\n\n\u201cSomething as fundamental as a constitution , the debate and the issues that ought to form the kernel of our governance have never been subjected to the intellectual rigour that is required. The result is that we have never debated our constitution based on the peculiarities, the cultural expectations, the hopes, the anxieties, the fears of ordinary Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the country will not be fixed until Muslims understand the grievances of the Christians; and until Christians understand the grievances of Muslims.\n\nThe publisher of ThisNigeria, Mr. Eric Osagie said Governor Wike was conferred with the flagship award of the newspaper because of his exceptional leadership in the vanguard of infrastructural revolution.\n\nThe \u201cGold Prize for Exceptional Leadership, according to him, is usually bestowed on that man or woman who has impacted exceedingly in the lives of Nigerians and in whose legacy has potential of transcending time and space.\n\nWike, the newspaper noted, has injected over 70 percent of the state income in capital project in the funding of roads and other critical infrastructure. A feat, that is unprecedented in the history of state administration in Nigeria.\n\nThisNigeria Newspapers also conferred Gold Prize in Public Service award on Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum ,Governor of Borno State; Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Ishaq Oloyede; and Chairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu respectively.",

          "text": "There appears to be a confusion of sort in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) with some members forming a parallel national caretaker committee, purportedly sacking the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and scheduling the party\u2019s convention for February 26, 2022.\n\nBut the Buni-led CECPC has disowned the group which it described as impostors, and asked security agents to swoop on them.\n\nThe new group which appointed President Muhammadu Buhari as head of its advisory committee also named Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and others as members of the new caretaker Committee.\n\nAddressing journalists Monday in Abuja, the group under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) announced the sack of the Buni-led committee and announced a new national caretaker committee with Mustapha Audu as chairman.\n\nAudu, who briefed journalists on the development, also announced the formation of a national reconciliation committee with a mandate to reconcile aggrieved members before its national convention slated for February, 26, 2021.\n\nHe said a zoning formula for positions in the new National Working Committee is expected to emerge at a national convention slated for February 26, 2022.\n\nWhile inaugurating the new committee, Audu the self-acclaimed national chairman said: \u201cToday, we are here to inaugurate the PYM \u2013 CECPC, these young men and women of noble repute have been carefully selected and mandated by all the well-meaning young stakeholders of our great party- the APC- to plan and execute our convention before the end of February 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the plethora of issues within the party. Our party has had a history of shying away from true reconciliation and in many cases inflicting chastisement on members that should have been rewarded for their effort towards building the APC. We will also be setting up a reconciliatory committee to help reconcile aggrieved members within the party.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that in the last couple of years, the party has been on a regressive course and it is necessary for all well-meaning party members to roll up our sleeves and do the needful to ensure that we correct the mistakes that have been made to ensure victory in 2023 for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would advise all party members to look inwards and understand the need to do things differently so that we can ensure we win back the trust of the Nigerian people as we move closer to the election year.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s join hands and strengthen our internal democracy in our dear party- the APC- and show Nigerians that we have what it takes and we deserve their votes in 2023,\u201d Audu added.\n\nCCEPC reacts\n\nReacting to the development in a statement, National Secretary of the Buni-led CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, described the new group as a \u201cpaid and misguided group.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cWe have received several enquiries from the media and concerned APC members on the felonious activities of a purported group parading themselves as \u201cProgressive Youth Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purported group and membership are unknown to the Party, its structure or as a registered support group. Hence, we completely disown them and cannot account for their activities or join issues with them.\n\n\u201cHowever laughable, the criminal attempt of the purported group to usurp the leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC now bothers (sic) on treasonable felony. Relevant security bodies must now check and address their unscrupulous activities.\n\n\u201cThe attention the purported group seeks will not be given to them by the party. We can only advise that the general public completely disregard them. Members of this group are not registered members of the APC and are being used by opposition elements and fifth columnists to cause confusion.\n\n\u201cAs widely reported, the successful meeting between the APC leadership, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and the President produced February 2022 as the timeframe for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\n\u201cOur focus now is preparing the ground for a rancour-free exercise.\u201d\n\nSheriff tackles Buhari, govs\n\nIn a related development, an APC national chairmanship aspirant and former Borno state Governor Alimodu Sheriff has warned President Buhari and governors elected on the party platform against jettisoning the party\u2019s constitutional requirements for a national convention.\n\nThe former governor said both the president and the APC governors lacked the power to fix a date for the party\u2019s national convention unless a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting is summoned.\n\nSheriff spoke through his campaign media director, Senator Victor Lar in Abuja Monday.\n\nHe said the February date must therefore be rectified by the party\u2019s NEC to make it constitutional.\n\n\u201cWe want to add that though we have commended the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) for taking the initiative to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari on the need for the party\u2019s National Convention to hold, the decision to hold the convention in February 2022 has to be by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\n\u201cIt is normal for members of the party\u2019s national caucus to meet that meeting between the PGF and the president was maybe a partial caucus meeting, even though it was not properly constituted and convened.\n\n\u201cBut both the governors and the president do not have the constitutional powers to take such decision. That decision is supposed to be taken by the party\u2019s NEC. So, we suggest that the APC governors, the president and the party should call a NEC meeting to rectify that February 2022 suggestion for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\u201cThe president does not have the constitutional powers to call for a meeting, neither do the governors. It is only the party\u2019s NEC that can take such decision as regards when its national convention will hold.\n\n\u201cWe, however, appeal to our members and supporters to remain calm and focused, we are on course and victory is certain,\u201d Modu Sheriff said.\n\nWhen asked to comment on media reports that APC has zoned the national chairmanship position to the North-central, Senator Lar described the report as laughable.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Modu Sheriff Campaign Organisation finds the purported story as very laughable because the organs of the party that are supposed to communicate that kind of information, are not the ones communicating it, for that reason, we will take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n\u201cAgain, the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party has never adopted zoning. At what point did they start zoning that they are talking about zoning the party\u2019s national championship position to the North Central?\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an open contest and the best candidate should emerge for the party to be galvanised for victory in 2023 and Sheriff remains the best candidate. We find the report as the very poor scheming of people who are scared of contesting the position with Sheriff.\u201d\n\nParty denies zoning\n\nSpeaking on zoning, the APC said it did not discuss or reach any decision to zone its national chairmanship position to the North-central zone as reported in a section of the media.\n\nThe party\u2019s scribe, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said the issue of zoning was not in the mandate of the CECPC. \u201cI have the mandate to report whatever decision the CECPC takes and to the best of my knowledge, the committee has not discussed zoning.\u201d\n\nHe added that with the party\u2019s national convention fixed for February 2022, it was expected that party members would come up with different zoning speculations.\n\n\u201cPeople are just flying what will favour their interest, all I know is that the caretaker committee has not discussed or reached a zoning decision,\u201d he said.\n\nMustapha lauds Buni c\u2019teee\n\nAlso speaking on the party leadership, a top national chairman ship aspirant, Malam Salihu Mustapha said the Buni-led committee was on course in its given assignment.\n\nHe said contrary to expectations in certain quarters, there was no uncertainty in the direction of the party under Buni\u2019s watch.\n\nMustapha said this at an interactive session with journalists recently in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere should be no blame game at this stage in our party. Honestly, there should be no blame game. Don\u2019t forget the caretaker committee has the mandate to stabilise the party, and that Governor Buni is doing creditably well. I think we should give it to him. This is not the time to be pointing accusing fingers. We must come together to ensure the committee realises its set objective of stabilising the party.\n\n\u201cYes, the committee is on course. No uncertainty in party direction. We are on the right course and we must not allow this collective effort to be derailed. The prayer is that we (referring to his chances) come out victorious so we, as a party, under my watch In Shaa Allah, can deliver dividends of democracy to Nigeria beyond the tenure of the present administration.\u201d\n\nOn what he hopes to do differently if he emerges as the party\u2019s chair, Mustapha, who was the deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) led by Buhari, said \u201cwhat I will do differently is looking at the future via what is obtainable now.\n\n\u201cIt is against this background that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made a 25-year-old man its national youth leader. So, if making a woman the national chairman is a strategy for a party to win election, why not?\u201d\n\nAssuring of a brighter chance over all fellow top contenders, the youthful politician said \u201cmy youthful age is an added advantage. Any party that wants to win in 2023 has to factor in the young generation because 75 per cent of the votes belong to the youths.\n\n\u201cThe ENDSARS has revealed some lessons. The message the ENDSARS was trying to pass before it was hijacked and mismanaged was that the youth should be effectively be part in the scheme of things. So, for me, having seen it all, I will perfectly fit into ensuring a kind of synergy between the old and the youth.\u201d\n\nWhile priding himself as having the endorsement of party stakeholders, Mustapha also said he looked forward to being the chairman for all.\n\n\u201cI want to be the chairman for all, and those contesting with me will be the first people I would approach after the election for them to buy into my programmes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC chieftain also identified the imposition of candidates on political parties as a major source of conflict in the nation\u2019s polity, saying this comes with a consequence.\n\n\u201cWe have seen several cases of imposition of unpopular candidates within our polity. You, as will suffer within and the party will also suffer outside because the ultimate of any political contest is to win election after which you settle down to good governance,\u201d Mustapha further added.\n\nThe former governorship aspirant in Kwara state also promised to bring about a leadership that would ensure equity and justice in the party and hold governors accountable to their manifestoes.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore the request of Igbo elders to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally.\n\nIn a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja Monday and signed by NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the forum said Buhari would be interfering in the judicial process should he consider the request of the Igbo elders.\n\nIt reads: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has carefully studied the request of Igbo Elders for President Muhammadu Buhari to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally. It has also noted President Buhari\u2019s response which both raised very weighty issues related to the request, and his commitment to consider it.\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that there are no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request and advises that President Buhari will do serious injury to a country already threatened by multiple challenges to its security and territorial integrity if he delays announcing the only responsible response, which is that the judicial process in the case of Kanu must be allowed to run its course.\n\n\u201cThe Forum noted a judicial decision to label bandits and kidnappers as terrorists, and recommends greater clarity in terms of the targets of this development. In any event, the Forum cautions against profiling and targeting all Fulani as terrorists. Millions of law-abiding Fulani exist, who should be encouraged to stay on the side of the law, while those who have chosen to continue on the path of criminality should feel the full weight of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Forum advises that the National census planned for 2022 should be postponed until after the 2023 elections. The integrity and success of a sensitive and vital activity such as this will be compromised by destabilized and threatened communities and proximity to another sensitive activity such as general elections.\n\n\u201cThe Forum invites attention to the hardship under which the vast majority of the population lives. Increasing poverty levels and widespread insecurity demand that leaders should exercise extreme caution in taking economic and security-related decisions.\n\n\u201cIncrease in the price of fuel in particular will compound the already desperate condition of living of most Nigerians.
