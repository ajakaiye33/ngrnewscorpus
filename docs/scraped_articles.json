          "text": "A bill seeking to allow judges to preside over two courts simultaneously narrowly scaled second reading at the House of Representatives on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the House had been divided over the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Fifth Alteration) Bill 2020, which proposes that a judge of the Federal High Court who has been elevated to a higher court should be allowed to conclude cases already before him or her at the lower court.\n\nLawyers in the House especially supported the proposal.\n\nThe lawmakers, however, resolved that the House Committee on Constitution Review, to which the bill was referred, should scrutinise the proposal to ensure that the move would not be counterproductive for the judicial system.\n\nThe legislation is titled, \u2018A Bill for an Act to Alter the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Cap. C23, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to Provide for Quick Justice Dispensation and Completion of Criminal Matters Heard By a Judge of a High Court Before his Elevation to the Court of Appeal.\u2019\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, Mr Onofiok Luke, who sponsored the bill, explained that the constitutional proposal sought to provide for quick justice dispensation and completion of criminal matters \u201cpart-heard\u201d by a judge of either the Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, High Court of the Federal Capital Territory or a State High Court before his elevation to the Court of Appeal.\n\nLuke said, \u201cIt is a common practice where judges of the High Court get elevated to the Court of Appeal whenever there is a vacancy. When judges get elevated, criminal cases presided by them before they were elevated get stalled and, in fact, start de novo (afresh).\n\n\u201cOwing to this unwholesome situation, this hallowed chamber in conjunction with its sister legislative body, the Senate, passed into law the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015, as a solution to that aspectual judicial problem.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker added, \u201cLast year, the Supreme Court, in its supreme wisdom, struck down Section 396(7) of the ACJA as being unconstitutional. The honourable court reasoned that a judicial officer cannot simultaneously assume the role of a Justice of the Court Appeal and still sit as a judge of the High Court, holding that such a practice was not within permissible constitutional boundary.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s view is principally anchored on the fact that Section 386(7) is a statutory provision, which cannot override constitutional provisions. The decision of the court has thrown up myriads of problems and has sailed us back to a harbour of delay in criminal adjudication which we thought we had left.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\n\nTHE National Lottery Trust Fund, NLTF, has refuted the 7billion fraud allegation levelled by the Senate Committee on Finance.\n\nFollowing an investigation into remittances by Ministries, Department and Agencies, MDAs, the committee on Finance chaired by Adeola Olamilekan, on Monday, accused the NLTF of being guilty of fraud over N7 billion.\n\nOlamilekan further adduced that the NLTF was responsible for disregarding the formal process of awarding a contract over N1.12 billion tagged: \u201cIntervention budget distribution\u201d that was requested in a letter dated March 12, 2014.\n\nBut NLTF\u2019s executive secretary, Bello Maigari, during a meeting with newsmen, in Abuja, described the allegation by Senate Committee on Finance as mischievous which was targeted to oppugn the integrity of the agency.\n\nMaigari said: \u201cNow, coming back to fraud, I must tell you this is mischief at the highest level. I cannot imagine how senior ranking members of the National Assembly will be accusing us of fraud when they have not even sat down to look at our books to check and verify how we the process tool place, whether the projects have been delivered or whether the equipment or whatever processes that we should ensure that procurement has been carried out have been checked.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cFor one to just jump to a conclusion and allege that there is fraud is too early in the day. We would have thought that we be given the benefit of hearing for us to defend whatever action we have taken so that at the end of the day there will be justice in the outcome of the committee\u2019s assignments.\n\nSpeaking on the allegation that the agency violated the required process in the award of contract in 2014, Maigari said that over 2,500 public primary schools benefited from nine sets of sport award.\n\nHis words: \u201cI have documentary evidence to the procurement they are referring about the sporting to public primary school in Nigeria. Over 2,500 primary schools benefited from nine sets of sports such as basketball, handball, soccer, volleyball they are all in the documentary and the benefits of these things, we have their contacts. We took due to pain to go through the processes of this procurement.\n\n\u201cInitially we had to obtain the approval of the honourable minister then to approve our budget A budget of N1.1 billion. Because the procurement involves a lot, we had to engage a consultant who knows the terrain. International business is not an easy thing. One needs to be careful.\n\n\u201cYou can easily be swindled and you must know that you are dealing with the right entity. That was why we took the pain to engage a consultant to enable us to fashion out the process to procure and ship this equipment into Nigeria both cleared at the port and handed to the agency which we now distributed to almost 2,500 primary schools across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe executive Chairman added that it is impossible for the agency to spend beyond what was appropriated for it as alleged by the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cOur remittance status in the period under review is not N7 billion. What was submitted to the committee is on record which is N6.3 billion not N7 billion. Even this figure when we directed it to the committee, the chairman directed that we should go and reconcile it with the national lottery commission because they said these figures; they don\u2019t have records of them.\n\n\u201cI was shocked to hear that a regulatory body does not have records of our remittance. It is their duties as regulators to not only render account on what we receive for good courses but should also render account for the prices Nigeria make when they play lottery and gaming.

That means that there is a lot of work to be done,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEl Rufai pointed out that the situation in Kaduna state is similar to the rest of the country, adding that it is worse in most states.\n\nThe governor urged the institute to help resolve the issue of revenue collection through taxation, considering dwindling oil revenue.\n\n\u201cMost countries are planning for a green economy in which oil will not be used at all.\n\n\u201cSo, we must begin to move away from oil. Oil is neither the answer nor the question that will solve our problems.\n\n\u201cThe real solution to our problems is better and efficient taxation of goods and services.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the fact that 75 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s economy is informal, how do we scale up the taxation of the informal sector? I think some progress has been made with Presumptive Taxation, but it is not enough.\n\n\u201cAgriculture accounts for a large proportion of our GDP. Here in Kaduna state, like any state in the federation, agriculture is the largest employer of labour and the largest contributor to GDP, but it is incapable of being taxed at the farm gate.\n\n\u201cHow do we tax agricultural production at the farm gate, not at the value-added and processing stage, so that we will be able to widen and broaden our tax net as well as proceeds,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "A Magistrate Judge for Eastern District of New York, Ramon Reyes, has ordered suspended Ogun Governor\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties, Abidemi Rufai, should be detained until his trial.\n\nThe Magistrate gave the order at the detention hearing Wednesday following Rufai\u2019s brother\u2019s refusal to serve as his third-party custodian.\n\nIt was gathered he will be transported to the Western District of Washington where his trial will commence.\n\nRufai, who was arrested on Friday, is to stand trial for allegedly defrauding the Washington State Employment Security Department of over $350,000 under the pseudonym Sandy Tang.\n\nIt was also gathered the prosecutors with the U.S Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington in court papers filed had urged the Magistrate to keep Rufai in custody until his trial in a Federal Court in Washington \u201cbecause he presents an extreme risk to flight and could use his strong political ties in Nigeria to flee from the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn the court document, prosecutors listed six arguments against the request for the release of Rufai.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge had reportedly prepared to release Rufai to the third-party custody of his brother Alaba Rufai, who is a New York attorney.\n\nThe Attorney\u2019s office was quoted to have revealed \u201chis brother who had tentatively agreed to serve as third-party custodian backed out in court when asked if he (Alaba) could post a $300,000 surety bond, payable in the event that Abidemi Rufai did not show up in court.\n\n\u201cThe government indicated it would appeal that ruling to a federal district judge in Western District of Washington.\n\n\u201cHowever, before the government needed to take that step, Mr. Rufai\u2019s brother indicated he could not serve as the third-party custodian.\u201d\n\nAccording to an official at the US Department of Justice, the detention order is considered permanent until such time as a future hearing is held in the Western District of Washington.\n\n\u201cThe timing on prisoner transport is up to the U.S. Marshal Service, and we will only know the timing of the next hearing when the defendant arrives in the district. Sometimes that takes as long as two to three weeks,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAmong the six reasons highlighted why Rufai should be kept in detention, it was argued that his history and characteristics weigh heavily in favour of detention \u201cparticularly his extensive ties to Nigeria as a government appointee and where his wife, two children, 15 siblings and parents all live except one brother who lives in New York.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutors also expressed the fear of no known address in the US, indicating \u201creleasing Rufai is a risk because he has no known contacts to the Western District of Washington where he allegedly stole the identities of its residents to rob the state of $350,000.\u201d\n\nThe case of Rufai being rich enough to fund his escape from the U.S was also put forward with the explanation that he has \u201csubstantial financial resources that will enable his flight if granted bail.\u201d\n\nRufai had however claimed he had only $16,000 in his account in Nigeria and the US but the Department believes the claim is dubious and untrue considering the amount ($288,825) a single U.S. bank account in Rufai\u2019s name received in deposits during the period of the fraud.\n\n\u201cRufai made the dubious representation to Pretrial Services that his total assets consist of $6,000 in the United States and $10,000 in a Nigerian bank account.\n\n\u201cAt the time of his arrest, the defendant was preparing to board a first-class flight to Nigeria with five debit cards and two credit cards in his wallet, a luxury Cartier watch, seven pieces of luggage, and three smartphones on his person,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors also opined that Rufai may likely be gone forever if he succeeds in fleeing the U.S because \u201cit is well known that extradition from Nigeria to the United States is difficult under the best of circumstances.\n\n\u201cThat will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment.\u201d\n\nRufai is accused of being a significant participant in what may have been the largest fraud ever against the Washington state government.\n\nOver $650 million had been reported stolen by fraudsters who claimed unemployment benefits.\n\nProsecutors want Rufai kept in detention till the commencement of his trial because the fraud he is being accused of relates to a presidentially-declared national emergency and a presidentially-declared major disaster for Washington, and \u201ceach of the five counts carries a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment, a statutory sentencing enhancement of 10 years.\u201d\n\nExpressing fears that he could flee prosecutors said \u201cthe cash bond and surrender of travel documents are wholly inadequate. Rufai could use his resources to purchase a fraudulent passport, or even slip over the border without one.\u201d",

          "text": "From Mokwugwo Solomon, Nnewi\n\nFormer prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the Vatican City, Francis Cardinal Arinze, has warned the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), and the Igbo people in general, not to attract another civil war in Nigeria through their actions or inactions.\n\nArinze, a onetime archbishop, Catholic Archdiocese of Onitsha, and an indigene of Eziowelle in Anambra State, made the plea in a viral video done in mixture of Igbo and English languages. He said those currently beating drums of war did not witness the Nigeria/Biafra war that took place between 1967 and 1970.\n\n\u201cAlmost all the people currently talking Biafra; Biafra, Biafra were probably not born, or were very young during the Nigeria/Biafra civil war that took place between 1967 and 1970. I know what I\u2019m saying; it\u2019s those that didn\u2019t see the war that are beating the drums of war.\n\n\u201cI was made archbishop of Onitsha two days before the outbreak of the war, and I know what the church and the civil population suffered. It is better imagined that witnessed.\n\n\u201cOjukwu and the rest of Biafra soldiers were fighting what they saw as a just cause, but being right or innocent does not guarantee victory in any battle. They tried their best, but they were defeated in the war, because, the Federal Government of Nigeria got support from the USA, Great Britain, and many other countries. Nigeria got arms and food, but Biafra did not.\n\n\u201cBiafra was persecuted; they fought hard; but they could not adequately defend themselves. They did their best, but were defeated. Today, there are uprisings everywhere. South East is not left behind. IPOB and Igbo people might have the cause to agitate, but contemplating another war is not advisable.\n\n\u201cMy advice is that they should sheathe their swords. Those that witnessed the civil war, either at the Nigerian side or Biafra side, wouldn\u2019t want war again,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, Arinze advised Igbo people, including those clamouring for referendum to be active in politics; saying it is the only solution for the Igbo to get what is theirs in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIgbo people should take political actions. By this, I mean Igbo people belonging strongly to major political parties in the country. This will give them the opportunity to participate in political discussions. When this happens, the Igbo will always get what is due for them; but staying out of politics, or probably staying in London to criticise government without making effort to be part of government and part of decision making will do the people no good,\u201d he said.",

Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe said across the world, conflicts and coronavirus have gone hand in hand.\n\nHe noted that as governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel, adding that terrorism is no common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\n\u201cAround the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.

Indeed, the resort to terror tactics, disregard to constitutional processes and disrespect for democratic standards to advance their interests of creating an ungovernable space in the region informed the decision of the Federal Government to outlaw IPOB.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe Operation RP in Enugu is the first in the line-up of our strategic plans to restore peace and order across the country\u201d adding that \u201cin the coming days, the special operation will be extended to other parts of the country to address the challenges of banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Governor Ugwuanyi said the occasion could not have come at a better time than now \u201cgiven the bourgeoning insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the exercise would herald the rejigging and re-tooling of the internal security architecture in the South East to bring it up to speed with emerging dimensions of criminality.\n\n\u201cThat expectation, in my judgment, seems more realisable with the reassuring presence of the Ag. Inspector-General of Police here today,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that his administration fully understands that the primary purpose of government is the security and welfare of the people, as enshrined in the Nigeria\u2019s constitution, Governor Ugwuanyi stated that \u201cpursuant to this leadership responsibility, we have strengthened our Neighbourhood Watch Associations, established Enugu State Forest Guards, which was a novel initiative of the South East Governors\u2019 Forum, and provided security patrol vehicles and communication gadgets to support the security agencies in our state.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022N\u2019Assembly considers request\n\n\u2022APC mortgaging nation\u2019s future, says PDP\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nFinancial analysts and the organised private sector yesterday expressed mixed feelings over Nigeria\u2019s rising public debt following a fresh request by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly to approve a $6.18 billion foreign loan.\n\nBefore the latest request, Nigeria\u2019s total external debt stood at $33.348 billion, while total public debt stock as of December 30, 2021, which was released by the DMO in March 2021, stood at N32.915 trillion.\n\nBuhari, in different letters to both chambers of the National Assembly urged the lawmakers to approve his request to borrow N2.3 trillion ($6.18billion) external loan to finance part of the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president in another letter also canvassed a concurrent approval by the legislature for a total sum of $3,837,281,256, \u20ac910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000 for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 federal government external borrowing rolling plan.\n\nThe two request letters, dated May 6, 2021, came a month after the Senate and the House of Representatives approved $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government to finance various priority projects and to support states facing fiscal challenges.\n\nBuhari\u2019s requests were contained in different letters addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThe letters were read at Tuesday plenary by the two presiding officers.\n\nThe president said the request for the N2.3 trillion loan to finance the 2021 budget deficit was in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act), which states that no external loan shall be approved or obtained by the minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution.\n\nAccording to him, the loan will enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, health, education, among others.\n\nHe said the loan would be sourced from a combination of multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nAccording to him, from recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds, and this explains why the federal government is proposing that the new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria may be able to raise $3 billion or more, but not more than $6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five-30 years.\n\nHe said the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approached the market.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201dThe purpose of this letter is to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) provided as new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion. The right honourable speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50 per cent or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081 ,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201dThe Senate President and right honourable Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with Nigeria\u2019s debt management strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nFor concurrent approval of donor fund projects, the president, in the second letter, said the projects would be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China Eximbank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nBuhari explained that the projects and programmes in the borrowing plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations as well as the contributions they would make to the socio-economic development of the country, including employment generation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201dSenate President and the right honourable Speaker may also wish to know that all the listed projects form part of the 2018 2020 external borrowing plan and covered both the federal and state governments\u2019 projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVlD -19 response efforts.\n\n\u201dA summary of some key projects in each of the six geopolitical zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\nGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed borrowing plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the House for 2018 2020 federal government external borrowing (rolling) plan to enable the projects to become effective.\u201d\n\nAnalysts Differ over Borrowing Request\n\nSome of the economic experts who spoke to THISDAY yesterday warned that the current bid to accumulate more public debts would mortgage the future of the country and its future generations.\n\nThey were also worried that the current move is not being done in a transparent manner that would enable Nigerians to know the specific projects the loan would be tied to and the institutions the government intended to borrow from.\n\nHowever, some others believed that the current move to borrow externally would enhance the country\u2019s foreign reserves and stabilise the value of the naira.\n\nOne of those who felt that the federal government should jettison the idea of accessing fresh foreign loan at this period is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nEkpo told THISDAY yesterday that he was worried that the current move by the federal government would worsen Nigeria\u2019s public debt management and subject future generations to financial bondage.\n\nHe advised the government to surgically reduce the bloated cost of governance in the country, warning that the government should be more concerned with its debt to revenue ratio as well as solvency and liquidity ratios because oil, which is its revenue base, is very shaky by depending on exogenous factors that it could not control.\n\nEkpo said the country\u2019s debt-servicing burden was taking almost one-third of Nigeria\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo, we are building debts for future generations to pay. Right now, Nigeria is merely scratching at its debt by servicing it without touching the principal.\u201d\n\nEkpo, who was the immediate past Director-General of the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management is also concerned about the transparency of the proposed borrowing.\n\nThe Director-General of Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, said it would be carelessness on the part of this government to be borrowing and building unsustainable debt burden for future generations and succeeding governments.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escape from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn.\u201d\n\nA professor of Finance, University of Lagos, Prof. Winifred Iyiegbuniwe, warned that Nigeria should not continue to borrow and dissipate them on wasteful expenses.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem is that we cannot continue to be borrowing in this manner and dissipate them through wasteful expenses. I have a problem as a financial economist when I am not convinced of what the government is doing with these borrowings. If we can borrow for specified and identifiable capital projects, fine. But if it is to borrow for consumption, no! We should cut our coat according to our cloth.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that all the long talk about removing fuel and electricity subsidies and plugging loopholes in tax collections are yielding nothing. They seemed to be too much talking with too little action. The only foreign borrowing that will make sense is one that is tied to a specific project. So, the government must be more specific about the infrastructure it intends to finance.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that the plan to borrow $6.18 billion external loan would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves but cautioned that it could also lead to heightened debt burden if not channelled to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Head of Research at Agusto Consulting, Mr. Jimi Ogbobine, said: \u201cThis could help boost foreign reserves at this point in time. But what we need to do is to complement it with other policies like the harmonisation of the exchange rate so we can stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) once again because we cannot survive on using loans to boost our foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nOgbobine, however, noted that \u201cthere are other ways of deficit financing because debt is not the only way of getting financing, which could also be done through taxes and sale of assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at all the unproductive assets and think of how we can get them out of the government\u2019s books in order to reduce recurrent expenditures on these assets,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo, said: \u201cWe know government is constrained with a shortage of fund but it should ensure that major part of the borrowing will go to the productive sector. There is really no harm in borrowing as long as it is used for productive purposes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, expressed concern that the rising debt profile of the federal government might not be sustainable because the debts will become a problem when the revenue base is not strong enough to service them.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to cut expenditure and undertake reforms that could scale down the size of government, reduce governance cost and ease the fiscal burden on the government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the debt should be used strictly to fund capital projects that would strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nHe also advised government to shift \u201cemphasis to concessionary financing against commercial debts that are typically very costly.\u201d\n\nAPC Mortgaging Future, Says PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday raised the alarm over another plan by the federal government to borrow N2.3 trillion.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told THISDAY that the additional loan request would mortgage the future of generations yet unborn Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are alarmed like any other Nigerian on this fresh loan request. It is simply to mortgage the nation and the future of the younger ones as they will be held in bondage by debts.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing is that upon all these loans, there is nothing tangible to show with the loans so far obtained. As a party and as Nigerians, we are worried. What is simply happening is just mis-governance and incompetence In all these multiple loans, the truth is that you cannot point any finger and say, this is what the Buhari administration has done with it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Buhari: Insecurity grows propensity for conflict\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Usman Alkali, yesterday launched a new operation to battle the rising insecurity in the South-east.\n\nHe also charged policemen in the region to be ruthless with secessionists.\n\nThe launch of the new security strategy, codenamed \u201cOperation RP\u201d is coming barely 24 hours after the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu State was attacked and property burnt by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums.\n\nAlso yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari said without security, economic opportunity would remain fragile and the propensity for conflict would grow, adding that military gains do not provide the whole solution.\n\nAlkali, at the launch of the operation in Enugu, charged policemen serving in the South-east region to deal ruthlessly with criminals and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing their will.\n\nHe urged policemen to be firm with criminals that may be threatening citizens within their area of jurisdiction.\n\nThe IG advised police personnel participating in the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe police leadership and the entire nation are looking out for two major outcomes as you discharge your duties during this operation: first, to stabilise the security order in the South-east in the shortest possible time; second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the policemen to be civil with law-abiding citizens, respect the rights of the citizens and undertake the operation within the dictates of rule of law.\n\nHe, however, charged them to defend themselves against any armed group that might attempt to attack them, or any police assets and other critical national infrastructure.\n\nHe described the people of South-east as historically peaceful, tolerant, innovative, industrious and entrepreneurial, who are highly respected citizens that have made their marks in the field of academics, scientific inventions and commerce.\n\nHe, however, lamented that although the Igbo are a unique ethnic group that freely and peacefully lives with others across the country and within the South-east, the events of late had altered the positive narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence. This trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria police, military and other security agencies are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 was conceptualised to ensure that \u201cwe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, expressed optimism that the operation would lead to the retooling of security architecture in the South-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday\u2019s event could not have come at a better time than now giving the point of insecurity in the country. In the past week, we have been saddened by the spate of killings of security operatives in their line of duty and destruction of security infrastructure and other public institutions in Nigeria, especially in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that today\u2019s event will herald the rejigging and retooling of international security architecture in the South-east geopolitical zone to bring it up to speed with an emerging dimension of criminality.\u201d\n\nInsecurity Grows Propensity for Conflict\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned that without security, economic opportunity will remain fragile and the propensity for conflict will grow.\n\nHe also said that because of the post-COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and France must seize the chance to strengthen its economic and military ties.\n\nBuhari stated this in an article entitled: \u2018Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Nigeria and France Must Seize the Chance to Strengthen Military and Economic Ties,\u2019 published yesterday by a Paris-based magazine, Le Point.\n\nHe said across the world, conflict and coronavirus had not been far apart and the war against the coronavirus was one Nigeria was fully united with France in a strong determination to overcome.\n\nThe solution, according to him, therefore, is to improve those conditions, as it leaves the people vulnerable to indoctrination.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs governments have struggled to contain COVID-19, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cTerrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorists have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon and Niger.\n\n\u201dWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation Occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon.\u201d\n\nThe president said as the world emerges from COVID-19, there is a chance to rebuild.\n\n\u201cThough we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with the idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for all,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari stated that the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets.\n\nSaying in that context fate is generally linked, the president highlighted that Paris had been active in the common fight.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into a lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\n\u201dNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperation if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating across our borders to cut the head off their groups.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Considers Options on Divestment Plan by Shell",
          "text": "\u2022Says proceeds of marginal fields used to augment FAAC\n\nNdubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe federal government is weighing some options as discussions with Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell Petroleum Development Company, begin over its plan for total divestment from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday in Abuja listed three possible options being considered as comprising a takeover of the company\u2019s stake in the oil and gas industry by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); acquisition by indigenous operators and involving a mixture of local players and other foreign independent operators in the process.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch energy giant has been gradually selling its onshore assets for over a decade in Nigeria.\n\nShell, operator of Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture (JV) SPDC, had recently indicated it would no longer continue to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ben van Beurden, however, said yesterday that its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nHe also told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHowever, Sylva who fielded questions from journalists on the issue stated that while the federal government is in consultations with the oil giant on the divestment move.\n\n\u201cSome actually feel that Shell should not hurriedly divest and to at least stay,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhere Shell has completely divested from a sector is not good for us.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the executive arm is discussing with the National Assembly on the quick passage of the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), saying that the bill will be passed lastest next month.\n\nSylva said: \u201cI want to tell you that PIB is fully on course and we are very happy because we have focused on that for a long time and we had many meetings with the National assembly and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cToday, I believe that we are all basically satisfied with where we are. The National Assembly has given a timeline. They actually gave April but a few things happened. But give or take, I still believe that the passage of the PIB will not go beyond June.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that between now and June, they will pass the PIB. I don\u2019t think we are far away with the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the nation\u2019s future lies in its vast gas reserves, which have been abandoned for decades, adding that the development of the huge gas potential will fast-track the diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cUnfortunately, what should have helped us are the laws around the oil industry and this has not happened over the last 20 years we have been tinkering with the laws. And yet, this law will power a lot of progress in this industry because the problem we have in the gas sector in Nigeria is that there are no clear fiscal regimes in the legal framework.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, harnessing the country\u2019s gas reserves which currently stands at 203 trillion TCF, will not only create jobs but also open more linkages with other sectors of the economy.\n\nSylva stated that the 203 trillion proven gas reserves were discovered in the course of oil exploration, adding that a conscious exploration could yield as much as 600 trillion tcf.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople have become more aware of the need for us to move towards gas. Last year, one of the first things we were able to achieve was the NLG Train7 final investment decision (FID) that has eluded the country for a long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the development of Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves, over $16.1billion has so far come into the country as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nHe added that the Nigeria Gas Commercialisation programme is fully on course, while the autogas policy is being finetuned in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which is to bring in conversion kits and make soft loans available for marketers to fit their filling stations.\n\nFor the policy to work effectively, he said there must be enough vehicles and filling stations.\n\nOn the recent judgement against Nigeria by a Milan court on the Malabu oil deal, the minister stated that the decision on the next move would depend on legal advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe minister also said the $1.5 billion required for the proposed rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery had been secured, adding that putting the refineries in shape was necessary before considering what options are better to run them, including using operations and management (O&M) experts.\n\nOn subsidy removal, Sylva said the federal government did not lack the courage or political will to float petrol price, but was considering stakeholders\u2019 views.\n\nHe stated that proceeds of the recent sale of marginal fields from Signature Bonuses were used to augment the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for April.\n\nOn reports in the social media that he collected $25 million from Saipem to award a contract in LNG Train 7, he said the contracted had already been awarded to Saipem before his appointment.\n\nShell CEO: Nigeria Onshore Oil Incompatible with Company\u2019s Climate Strategy\n\nOil multinational, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yesterday shed more light on its decision to divest from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe company said its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nThe company stated that it had been under increasing pressure from investors to slash emissions and pivot toward cleaner energy, even as the tension was on show at its shareholder meeting yesterday.\n\nBloomberg reported that while speaking at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe balance of risks and rewards associated with our onshore portfolio is no longer compatible with our strategic ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe cannot solve community problems in the Niger Delta and the company has started discussions with the government on how to move forward.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say explicitly that Shell wanted to sell the remainder of its oil assets in the Niger Delta, nor did he provide a timetable.\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term energy transition plan laid out to investors for the first time received overwhelming support, but a competing resolution asking for stricter targets also garnered more votes than ever.\n\nAdding to the tension, shareholders were meeting as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that all new oil and gas developments needed to stop immediately for climate targets to be met.\n\nShell also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its spill-prone operations in Nigeria, where it has been pumping out oil for half a century.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch company has been gradually selling onshore assets in Nigeria for more than a decade, as it sought to put aside chronic problems such as pollution caused by ruptured pipelines and the resulting legal battles with local communities.\n\nThe issue has become more acute in the past year after Shell pledged to transform itself into a clean energy giant and gradually winds down its oil and gas business to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nYet a full retreat would be an obvious endpoint to years of gradual divestment, even as Shell has reduced its total number of onshore licences in Nigeria by half over the past decade and has been focusing on offshore oil fields and gas operations in the country.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 meeting was dominated by investors\u2019 questions on Shell\u2019s climate strategy, ranging from pleas to set more ambitious targets on reducing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuels, to a request that the company \u201cstop apologising\u201d for the products it sells.\n\nWhen asked about an IEA\u2019s new report on stopping new oil and gas fields, Chairman, Chad Holliday, said Shell hadn\u2019t had time to study the report but would do so in due course.\n\nShell\u2019s energy transition plans, which forecast a big expansion in clean energy but also decades more oil and gas production, received nearly 89 per cent votes, while a competing proposal from the group rose to 30 per cent, more than double a year earlier.\n\nShare this:

          "title": "WHY OSINBAJO ATTENDED MUSEVENI\u2019S INAUGURATION",
          "text": "Etim Etim writes that Osinbajo went to represent the President of Nigeria\n\nSome commentators have expressed concern about the recent trip Vice President Yemi Osinbajo made to Kampala to attend the sixth-term inauguration of President Yoweri Museveni. They argue that since the Ugandan leader had been in office since 1986, first as a military leader who seized power through a bloody coup, and has been governing the country badly, Nigeria should have boycotted the event. A columnist with The Punch, Tunde Odesola, wrote that the VP \u201ccrash-landed like Humpty Dumpty under the weight of lawlessness\u2019\u2019 for attending the event. Mr Odesola went on to state that the VP applauded Museveni as \u2018\u2019a democratically elected President\u2019\u2019. Prof Osinbajo never made such a statement. Apart from the usual pleasantries and courtesies routinely extended to foreign dignitaries at such occasions, Yemi Osinbajo did not make any speech. I just wonder why Odesola had to make up that part of his article. For what purpose? Such illogical comments are the reason some Nigerian writers have lost their leverage, respect and influence in recent years. Many of our opinion writers these days do not exhibit deep knowledge of the matter they comment on; and in place of balanced, well-informed and deep commentaries and analyses that we read in foreign journals, some Nigerian writers routinely resort to name-calling and insults.\n\nFirst of all, Professor Osinbajo did not go to Kampala on his personal capacity; neither did he attend the event as a friend or in-law to Museveni. The VP attended the inauguration as the head of the Nigerian delegation representing the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This means that for the few hours that he was in Uganda, Prof Osinbajo was representing President Buhari and the over 200 million people of this great country, with all the prestige and honour that go with our name. It is therefore a gratuitous insult to launch attacks at the person of the VP for carrying out a national duty. More so, I should note that the Nigerian government had never taken a decision to boycott the event or sever diplomatic relations with Uganda because of Museveni\u2019s bad behavior.\n\nLet me be clear, Yoweri Museveni is a good example of what is wrong in Africa. After 35 years of leading a murderous and dictatorial r\u00e9gime, both as a junta military leader and a civilian despot, the man has nothing to offer his impoverished East African country. The election last year in which the young opposition leader, Robert Kyagulanyi SSentamy, widely known by his stage name of Bobi Wine, was locked up in house arrest and denied fair chance in the race, showed Museveni\u2019s unrelenting determination to sit tight in office. Together with Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Museveni represents the disappearing relics of ancient Africa; the Africa of Mobutu, Ghaddafi, Abacha, Idi Amin and Bokassa! But as we all know, diplomatic relationships among nations abhor undue interference of one country in the internal affairs of another. That is why no country has rolled in tanks into Myanmar despite the draconian crackdown of the new military government there. But where such meddling in the affairs of a country is desirable, it is done under the multilateral banner of the UN or the African Union. Remember how the AU authorized Nigeria to interfere in The Gambia, Liberia and Sierra Leone to restore peace and order? So far, neither the UN Security Council nor the African Union has passed any resolution to punish Uganda or Museveni, its leader. That explains why the event was also attended by Presidents of several other African countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Guinea, South Sudan, Namibia, Ghana, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Burundi, Tanzania and Ethiopia.\n\nThird, I should also note that attending the inauguration of a leader of a foreign country does not necessarily tantamount to an endorsement of certain inimical practices of such a foreign leader. It is even more beneficial to use diplomatic engagements to mollify a bad leader. Nigeria enjoys a longstanding relationship with Uganda that supersedes current political leaders in both countries and would certainly outlast their respective foibles. Uganda supported the emergence of Nigeria\u2019s Ngozi Okonji-Iweala as the WTO DG; Dr Akinwumi Adeshina as the AfDB President and Prof Benedict Oramah as the President of Cairo-based AFREXIM Bank. Nigeria will need a broad continental support in our quest for the membership of the UN Security Council and other leadership of other global organizations. Even managing our security challenges and other continental responsibilities like the recharging of Lake Chad, control of the flows of small arms and reversing of irregular migration across the Mediterranean, our country will always rely on the goodwill of African countries. It was therefore right for President Buhari to send the Vice President to Kampala. Our size, resources and prestige bestow on us a leadership role in the continent. Our country should be proud of its investments in Africa, ranging from our untold contributions to the freedoms of South Africa and the erstwhile frontline states to our contributions to peacekeeping under the banner of the UN. We spent billions of dollars and lost thousands of soldiers to restore peace in Liberia, Sierra Leone and The Gambia. Within the ECOWAS sub region, our country is admired, adored and respected for its stabilizing roles in some troubled neighbours. But leadership entails a delicate balancing act. You embrace your friends openly, but whisper the need for them to change their bad habits privately. Nigeria therefore has a responsibility to privately reprimand some African leaders who are still steeped in the old traditions without jeopardizing the need for sustaining mutually beneficial friendships.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to say that Yemi Osinbajo deserves our collective respect and admiration for his service to Nigeria. His personal and official conducts have been stellar. His sterling contributions to the Buhari administration and deep loyalty to the President have been very impressive, especially in these trying times when supporters of the government, including some ministers and heads of government\u2019s agencies, have retracted from speaking for the government. I commend the VP for being the most visible face of the administration, come rain, come sunshine.\n\nEtim, a journalist, wrote from in Abuja\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

All the documents ranging from the invitation letters and our client\u2019s reply with the documentary proofs will be found if demanded.\n\n\u201cSir, it is instructive to ask why the witch-hunt? Why the hurry to declare our client wanted? Why the publication without properly inviting our client in accordance with the law? What actually is the aim behind these investigations having been investigated by the DSS and EFCC on the same subject matter?\u201d\n\nKumo said he is ready to approach the ICPC the moment he is properly served with an invitation.\n\nSaharaReporters had on May 14 reported that a statement signed by Ogugua, ICPC Spokesperson, urged the public to provide information about the whereabouts of Kumo and his cohort.\n\nThe statement had read, \"The persons whose pictures appear above, Mr. Tarry Rufus, Mr. Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr. Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of Sixty-five million dollars ($65,000,000),\" the commission said.\n\n\"Anyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters Abuja, any of the ICPC State Offices or the nearest police station.\"\n\nDocuments: Gimba Yau vs. Ic... by Sahara Reporters",

          "title": "Nigerians mourn a painful dip day for crypto, but the rallying cry is \u201cHODL!\u201d",
          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAs our interview drew to a close I asked her what dreams and goals she had. \u201cEssentially, I just want to be happy\u2026\u201d This was how she began her answer.\n\nThe other part of her answer that stuck with me was her plan to sell natural hair wigs to \u201cblack women everywhere.\u201d\n\nWith her business Natural Girl Wigs, she now ships to black women in over 65 countries.\n\nWe talk about growing up in Lagos and falling in love with her hair. Her story takes us from building a community on social media to later growing a successful tech-enabled business with that same community.\n\nHer name is Oluremi Martins-Areola and this is her life in tech.\n\nIt\u2019s all about hair. Black hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a very interesting view of my hair.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerian millennials remember where they were when Agbani Darego won the Miss World Pageant in 2001. I remember a lot of rejoicing on my street when the announcer said \u201cMiss Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFor Oluremi, the pageant was one thing to be excited about but Darego\u2019s iconic hairdo would be the thing with the lasting influence.\n\n\u201cMy father would indulge me during the weekends and take me to go do the Agbani Darego style,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Monday she had to return to whatever hairstyle her secondary school had assigned. But for those weekends, Oluremi\u2019s hair could do whatever she wanted it to.\n\nShe went on to study history and diplomatic studies at the University of Lagos but for her, deciding on what to study was not something she had bothered about too much.\n\n\u201cIt was actually never about what I was going to study. I always knew that school would be a stepping stone to whatever I wanted to achieve. I felt I was going to go into some type of media or doing a business that had an impact so I felt like it was okay to do anything in school.\u201d\n\nWhile at the university, she became active on social media and started learning about digital marketing through online courses. This would help her land a job as a social media manager for a consulting firm right out of school.\n\nShe changed jobs a few times before finally working at Image Boosters, a digital agency where she would begin to form the idea for her business.\n\n\u201cIt was a personal awakening for me because I had this beautiful natural hair and anytime I wanted to buy wigs or protective styles it was always these European or Indian weaves.\u201d\n\nOluremi\u2019s business started with an Instagram page where she built a community of black women who wanted to care for their hair but also get access to wigs made just for them.\n\n\u201cI thought, why shouldn\u2019t I have wigs that look like my natural hair\u2026\u201d\n\nShe soon began selling wigs sometime in 2018 and eventually left her job after six months of running the Instagram account.\n\nLooking back on her decision to leave paid employment and face her business full time, Oluremi tells me it was tough. She had just gotten a promotion that came with more money and deciding to leave at that time felt scary.\n\nBut by the end of her first year, she had made revenue of up to six figures in dollars \u2013 and she hadn\u2019t even set up her website yet. Her dream of reaching black women around the world was slowly starting to take shape.\n\nBuilding Natural Girl Wigs\n\nBefore the pandemic, Oluremi already ran a remote workforce. Save for the actual making of the wigs, there was no need for her staff to be physically present for anything. She counts this as one of the reasons the pandemic didn\u2019t disrupt her business too much.\n\nNatural Girl Wigs is currently in its third year. After making impressive sales in the first year, it became important for the company to have its own solutions available on a website and not just a social media account.\n\nThe business now caters to black hair in different ways. Of its features, The Hair Quiz stands out. With the quiz, customers are able to answer questions about their hair and are provided with recommendations on hair care and products.\n\nThe website also provides hair tutorials and content tailored to black hair.\n\nOne of the toughest parts of running an e-commerce business anywhere in the world today has to be logistics. To ease the strain of shipping to one of her biggest markets \u2013 the U.S. \u2013 Oluremi had to start manufacturing the wigs in the U.S. as well.\n\n\u201cLogistics is a serious challenge we\u2019ve faced. We currently work with a third party entity that handles delivery for us.\u201d\n\nWith Natural Girl Wigs now delivering to countries all over the world, Oluremi points out how a community was key to growing.\n\n\u201cThe theme for the initial Instagram page was just me posting things around beauty and lifestyle to a great community of people that would be interested in the product I was going to launch.\u201d\n\nThe community has continued to grow and Natural Girl Wigs currently has close to 60,000 email subscribers.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nFor Oluremi, the future for Natural Girl Wigs involves scaling manufacturing. A lot of the materials being used are currently being imported from China and other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen I was doing my research, I realised that most of the manufacturers of hair are Chinese or Asian and a future I would like to explore is one where I have a factory where we make hair from scratch in Africa.\u201d\n\nAway from work, there are a few things Oluremi enjoys: hanging out with her husband, going to restaurants, attending events in Lagos. She hopes to continue to do these things that make her happy.\n\nShe would also like to help people realise the paths to their own goals and dreams.\n\nWhether through her Instagram videos on growing your business or any other medium she may use soon, Oluremi is keen on letting people know that it\u2019s never too late to go for the things they want because as she puts it, \u201cwhenever you wake up is your morning.\u201d",

          "title": "Only seven states in Nigeria are implementing reduced Right of Way fees",
          "text": "According to Nigeria\u2019s national broadband plan (2020-2025), broadband penetration should hit 90% by 2025. It is an ambitious goal given that for years, broadband penetration has hovered around the 30% region.\n\nBut there has been some recent progress. A tweet from the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, revealed that in 2020, broadband penetration increased to 43.3%. Analysts like Gbenga Sesan have noted that the figures the ministry claims are wrong and that broadband penetration is less than 10%.\n\nWhatever the correct figure is, Nigeria still has some ways to go due to a mix of challenges, one of which is infrastructure and an inability to standardise fees. For broadband access to increase throughout the country, network operators have to dig up roads and lay optic fibre cables.\n\nThey cannot install such hardware without a Right of Way (RoW) approval from state governments. But RoW fees are high and it is expensive to lay cables; so broadband connectivity suffers.\n\nWhile RoW is a source of revenue for state governments, the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract telcos to make a significant broadband investment. In 2020, MTN requested approval from the Ekiti state government to lay 160km of fibre optic cables after reducing its RoW fees.\n\nGovernors agree to slash Right of Way fees\n\nStandardising RoW fees is one way to encourage telcos to make investments in broadband infrastructure, so in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s 36 governors agreed to an important step \u2013 a standardised RoW fee of \u20a6145/m.\n\nSo far, only Kaduna, Ekiti, Katsina, Plateau, Ekiti, Kwara, Anambra, and Imo are implementing the new fees one year after the agreement. States like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge N2,500, N4,000, N750 per Linear Meter.\n\nIt is unclear why these states are not implementing the new fees, but stakeholders continue to mount pressure regardless. There are reports that the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) is looking at signing a Memorandum of Understanding with states to bring down RoW charges.\n\nThere have also been discussions on the floor of the National Assembly, but it has not translated into lower fees mostly because the governors reserve the right to fix these fees.\n\nRegardless of this power, the governors of the remaining 29 states must play the long game and lower prices because deepening broadband penetration is a big win for Nigeria as a whole.",
          "summary": "According to Nigeria\u2019s national broadband plan (2020-2025), broadband penetration should hit 90% by 2025.\nIt is an ambitious goal given that for years, broadband penetration has hovered around the 30% region.\nA tweet from the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, revealed that in 2020, broadband penetration increased to 43.3%.\nAnalysts like Gbenga Sesan have noted that the figures the ministry claims are wrong and that broadband penetration is less than 10%.\nThey cannot install such hardware without a Right of Way (RoW) approval from state governments.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAs a serving Corper with the Nigerian Observer Newspaper, I walk pass the magnificent Oba of Benin\u2019s palace on my way to work from the popular Ring Road Junction. Each time I sight the palace, I would have a reverberant curiosity of how the palace looks like on the inside. I imagined that the palace most hold a lot for my curious mind.\n\nAlas, dreams come through and I was at the Oba\u2019s palace last week for the Ugie Ododua Festival with my other senior colleague reporters. It was exciting to be where I had longed to be. Enquired what the festival is about and an elderly man in the audience replied that it was a ceremony for the purification and sanctification of the land, to ward off evil and appease the gods for bountifulness in the land.\n\nTo say that Benin Kingdom was and is still rich in cultural heritage is almost cliche. The vividity of the cultural cosmology of the Benin people is not only in the history books that we read but also the oral traditions and customs of the people give credence to their cultural aesthetics. A trip to Benin city will leave you with out a doubt of its cultural renaissance.\n\nA few meter away from the Oba\u2019s palace is the Benin National Museum which houses some of the finest arts and crafts of the Benin people. It serves as a tourist attraction to visitors seeking to know more about the ancient great Benin Empire.\n\nThe Ugie Ododua festival usually takes a period of fourteen days. The first seven days are observed as indoor activities while the later seven days are observed as public performances, the one we attended being the grand finale with dignitaries far and near in attendance. While the palace was crowdy, the atmosphere was solemn. As a cultural enthusiast nothing could be more gratifying than to witness the epic festival.\n\nDuring the festival, seven Ododua masquerades dressed in red regalia come out in a single file from Ugha-Erhoba accompanied by members of the Iwebo Palace Society, chiefs Osague, Osa and Osuan of Benin Kingdom. Each of these seven masquerades represent a deity in the kingdom.\n\nWith unique drum beats, dance steps and incantations, each masquerade marched to the throne of the Oba ( King) to offer supplication and pay homage. The Benin people see the Oba as both political and spiritual head of the kingdom.\n\nThere were also the Ononges ( the dukes of the kingdom) and the members of the royal family who were all dressed in white paraphernalia. They all made obeisance to His Royal Majesty. I indeed feasted my eyes on the legendary display of culture.\n\nSpeaking of the historical background of Ugie Ododua festival, the Benin people trace the origin to Oba Eweka1 who used the festival to commomerate the successful return of Oramiyan the son of Ododua to his ancestral home, the Benin kingdom which also marked the return of of Obaship era after a period of interregnum.\n\n\u201cToday, the festival is celebrated at the instance of OmoN\u2019ObaN\u2019Edo, Aku Akpolokpolo to offer prayers to Ancestors for blessings and protection of Oba, members of the Royal family, chiefs and the entire people of the kingdom and beyond.\u201d Remarked a titled chief.\n\nBut the sanctity of Benin Kingdom had suffered a setback in 1897 when the British colonial forces razed Benin City, massacring an unknown number of people and bringing a violent recess to the advancing civilization to the Kingdom of Benin, which had thrived for centuries as one of West Africa\u2019s major powers. The invasion was to avenge the killing of an earlier force by the soldiers of the Oba.\n\nThere are records that during the raid, British troops looted at least 3,000 precious artifacts made by the Edo people, including ivory statues, carved elephant tusks, ceramics, masks, carved portraits of Obas (or kings) and their mothers, and more than 1,000 intricately decorated brass plaques that once adorned ancestral altars and court buildings in the city\u2019s royal palace.\n\nIn the wake of last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests that re-echoed around the globe of injustices against the black people around the world, there is an invigorating call for the restitution of looted treasures from the African continent by the Western countries during the dark years of incursion and colonialism. Many museums and organizations across the Europe where these looted artifacts especially the Benin Bronzes are kept have heeded the call.\n\nAs reported by BBC in April, the German Culture Minister, Monika Gruetters has disclosed that \u201cthe first return of the looted treasures were expected to take place in 2022\u201d.\n\nThe tragic retaliatory invasion of Benin Kingdom by the British government seemed to be the end of the once ebullient kingdom but we know that the history of mankind is replete with rise and fall or fall and rise as the case maybe. Benin rose again and about a century and half later, the sanctity of the people\u2019s culture is still upheld with a stylish dignity.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

Therefore, we can no longer afford to ignore actions against greenhouse effects.\n\n\u201cIt is to this end that these sets of standards and the other approved standards in this category are considered very important, timely and instruments for actions to support energy sufficiency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director general said that the standards would also mitigate the negative effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cAs these standards are launched today, opportunities for fair trade practices, lowered cost of manufacture/assembly, consumer satisfaction, business expansion, employment creation and career development will all be enhanced.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to comply with all the requirements of these standards to ensure good manufacturing practices and the best product quality that will satisfy all consumers at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nSalim explained that the SON would carry out stakeholders awareness campaign and strict enforcement to ensure that manufacturers, project developers and users complied with the new standards.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that representatives of relevant government agencies, international partners and other stakeholders in the power sector were present at the launch.\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission(NERC), Federal Ministry of Power, the Nigerian National Committee of IEC/Technical Committee were among the relevant institutions that sent their goodwill messages to SON.\n\nEngr. Peter Ewesor, NEMSA Managing Director and Chief Electrical Inspector of the Federation, said that the launch was a milestone in the effort toward enforcement of standards and regulations.\n\nHe said that NEMSA enforcement team would work with SON to ensure that manufacturers of electrical materials and installations upheld stipulated standards.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) Plc hosted the number one citizen, His Excellency, Muhammdu Buhari, GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria at the launch of its campaign, The Stock Africa Is Made Of.\n\nThe virtual event which took place on Tuesday, 18 May 2021 was held to amplify NGX Group\u2019s positioning and commitment to the African financial markets as a leading capital market infrastructure provider, connecting Nigeria, Africa and the world, as well as spotlight the growth potential of the African continent.\n\nIn delivering his remarks prior to sounding the closing gong and bringing the day\u2019s trading to a close, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR stated, \u201cIt is my pleasure to join you all at this important event organised to amplify the positive narrative about Africa and its great potentials. Let me start by congratulating Nigerian Exchange Group Plc on its recently concluded demutualisation, which is the first in the country. I recall signing the Demutualisation Bill in August 2018, paving the way for the long awaited demutualisation of the then Nigerian Stock Exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also important for me to highlight that the history of NGX Group is tied to that of the Nation itself founded 61 years ago at a pivotal time when Nigeria gained her independence. The Exchange continues to play its part in nation building by stimulating economic growth and providing a platform for businesses and individual to save and raise capital through innovation, diversified products and services, enabling regulatory environment and much more. The occasion of the demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange is yet a proud moment for all of us, and indeed all Nigerians deserve congratulations for this feat as it is the beginning of a new era for the capital market,\u201d President Buhari added.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Group Chairman, NGX Group Plc, Otunba Abimbola Ogunbanjo stated, \u201cThe Exchange has come a long way, through different leadership regimes \u2013 civilian and military \u2013 that have overseen multiple boom and bust economic dispensations within the Nigerian economy, to emerge as a leading integrated market infrastructure in Africa and the engine of growth for Africa\u2019s largest economy. Our story is one birthed from resilience, collaboration, determination and continued focus on our vision. A true Africa story. With demutualisation, NGX Group is well positioned to enable strong economic growth and contribute its quota to the development of the Nigerian capital market, and the African Continent.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group Plc, Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, OON noted that, \u201cAt Nigerian Exchange Group Plc, we have a vision to be the premier Exchange hub for Nigerian businesses and for the wider African economy building on the strong reputation and corporate governance the NSE has established over the years. As we march bravely into the NGX era, we look forward to impact creating partnerships that will unlock value for our stakeholders, whilst improving the state of the Nigerian economy. It is a period to reinforce on the global stage, our great African pedigree and the Stock Africa Is Made of.\u201d\n\nThe unveiling event culminated in a Closing Gong Ceremony where the CEO, Nigerian Exchange Limited, Mr. Temi Popoola, CFA, stated, \u201cI am delighted to have hosted His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, our special guest of honour. Today\u2019s epochal Closing Gong Ceremony could not have been possible without Mr President\u2019s support. The NGX era is indeed very exciting for us and we will continue to champion the growth of the African capital market through trade and investments that will facilitate Africa\u2019s economic recovery and reposition the continent for sustainable economic development. Partnerships are a critical element of our strategy and we will continue to engage our stakeholders whose support is essential to the achievement of our aspirations in this NGX era.\u201d\n\nIn her closing remarks, the CEO, NGX Regulation Limited, Ms. Tinuade Awe stated, \u201cMy deepest gratitude goes to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, for gracing us with his presence and honouring our invitation to close the market on the official launch day of the NGX era. This has truly been an inspiring event and we have our amazing line-up of speakers to thank for that. I must also thank our regulators, the entire capital market ecosystem and the Management and staff of Nigerian Exchange Group for the hard work and diligence that has set us firmly on the path of success. It has been an exciting journey to date, and I am confident that we will all work well together to achieve even greater heights in the NGX era.\u201d\n\nThe event featured several key speeches and goodwill messages from industry veterans across the public and private sectors including Dr. Zainab Ahmed, Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Federal Republic of Nigeria; Otunba Richard Adeniyi Adebayo, CON, Honourable Minister of Trade and Investment, Federal Republic of Nigeria; Mr. Lamido Yuguda, Director General, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Alhaji Aliko Dangote, GCON, Chairman, Dangote Group; Mr. Jim Ovia, CON, Chairman, Zenith Bank Plc; Mr. Masai Ujiri, President, Toronto Raptors; Mr. Tony Elumelu, CON, Group Chairman, United Bank for Africa (UBA) & Founder, The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF); Mr. David Swchimmer, CEO, London Stock Exchange; Ms. Julie Becker, CEO, Luxembourg Stock Exchange; Mr. Eric Hespenheide, Board Chairman, Global Reporting Initiative; and Mr. Ben Llewellyn-Jones, Deputy British High Commission Lagos.\n\nAward-winning singer, songwriter and producer Innocent \u20182Baba\u2019 Idibia alongside the \u2018boo of the booless\u2019, Chike, provided first-class entertainment at the virtual event which was moderated by veteran Master of Ceremonies, Ik Osakioduwa.",

We have seen that the Governor has keyed into Mr.\n\nPresident\u2019s agenda of achieving food security in the country.\n\n\u201cWith what the Governor has put in place in infrastructure, it has made our job easier. Farmers will be able to convey their produce to the market as a result of good road network in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are establishing an integrated farm estate in Ebonyi, like we are doing in other states.

The fight was signed,\u201d Joshua tweeted in a message to Fury.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also turned down Fury\u2019s offer of a \u201cfight this weekend bare knuckles till 1 man quits\u201d for \u00a320m each.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll slap your bald head and you\u2019ll do nothing,\u201d tweeted Joshua.\n\nFury then called Joshua a \u201cbottlejob\u201d and claimed: \u201cI\u2019ll smoke wilder first then you will get yours aswell (sic).\u201d\n\nHearn has admitted he is considering alternative plans, notably a contest between Joshua and Ukraine\u2019s Oleksandr Usyk, who is mandatory challenger for the WBO title.\n\nJoshua holds the WBO, WBA and IBF belts, meaning a bout with Fury would have been the first at heavyweight for all four world titles.",

          "text": "Acting Inspector-General of Police Usman Alkali issued a directive to police officers yesterday ordering them to deal ruthlessly with criminal elements and secessionists who try to put their will to the test.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of widespread security breakdowns across the region.\n\nPolice officers are being killed in attacks on their stations in the Southeast and Southsouth, which are often burned.\n\nGunmen are indiscriminately killing police officers at checkpoints.\n\nInmates were released after an assault on the Owerri correctional center.\n\nThe separatist group Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) has increased its violent activities.\n\nSeparatists\u2019 voices have become stronger in the Southwest, with Prof. Banji Akintoye and Sunday Igboho at the forefront.\n\nThe acting Inspector General of Police (IG) initiated Operation Restore Peace (Operation RP) at Michael Okpara Square in Enugu, the state capital, yesterday.\n\nAlkali said: \u201cYou are charged to be civil with the law-abiding citizens, but firm and ruthless with criminal elements and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing your will or threatening the citizens within your area of jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance to the goals of this special operation, I charge you to henceforth, defend yourselves courageously against any armed group that attempts to attack you, any police assets, and other critical national infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the police officers and men on the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nOn expectations, he said: \u201cFirst, to stabilise the security order in the Southeast in the shortest possible time. Second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nAlkali said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence.\n\n\u201cThis trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders, as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria Police, military and other security agencies, are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\n\n\u201cAside from this, the deepening inter-ethnic prejudice and intolerance in the region are also occasioning unjustifiable inter-ethnic violence and counter-violence.\n\n\u201cApart from the massive loss of property and fatalities to lives, the violent campaigns are beginning to have a damaging effect on the socio-economic development of the region.\n\n\u201cThis trend is being compounded by the illegal proliferation of firearms as well as the deployment of the social media by the leadership of IPOB to indoctrinate, misinform, and misdirect Southeasterners towards the path of violent separatism.\n\n\u201cThis evolving trend constitutes a major threat to our nation\u2019s internal security and national unity and, hence, requires urgent sets of all-inclusive actions to roll back the disastrous tide.\n\n\u201cWe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\n\n\u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 by the Nigeria Police is aimed at this direction and it follows the directives of Mr President to the Nigeria Police to re-evaluate and emplace new operational strategies to stem the tide of violence and secessionist agenda not only in the Southeast but across the country.\n\n\u201cAs the lead agency in the internal security framework of this country, the Nigeria Police under the current dispensation acknowledges that the duty of securing the lives and property of the citizens is its primary mandate.\n\n\u201cThe launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 in Enugu today is the first in the line of our strategic Action Plan to restore peace across the country and in the coming days, the special operation will be extended to other parts of the country to address peculiar crimes including banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery in other geopolitical Zones.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that \u2018Operation RP\u2019 will cover all the states within the Southeast geopolitical zone. I am confident that with the support of all strategic stakeholders, the operation will in due course, change the current security narratives in the Zone for good.\u201d\n\nThe operation will be carried out by the Force\u2019s operatives in coordination with the Armed Forces, the intelligence community, and other sister security agencies, according to the police chief.\n\nHe enlisted the help of civil society, especially traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth organizations, business organizations, cultural organizations, and professionals.\n\nWith the support of all strategic stakeholders, the IG predicts that the operation will eventually change the region\u2019s existing security narratives.\n\nIfeanyi Ugwuanyi, the governor of Enugu State, thanked Alkali for the service.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, he said, \u201cgiven the country\u2019s burgeoning insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe enlisted the help of civil society, especially traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth organizations, business organizations, cultural organizations, and professionals.\n\nWith the support of all strategic stakeholders, the IG predicts that the operation will eventually change the region\u2019s existing security narratives.\n\nIfeanyi Ugwuanyi, the governor of Enugu State, thanked Alkali for the service.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, he said, \u201cgiven the country\u2019s burgeoning insecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have institutionalised functional collaboration between our neighbourhood watch groups, forest guards and security agencies, especially in the area of intelligence sharing.\n\n\u201cEnugu State Security Trust Fund Law is in place to ensure sustainable funding for security agencies in our state. The deployment of our Automated Drone Surveillance Solution to give the needed impetus to our security surveillance is underway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not rested on our oars in providing a safe and secure environment for residents to live, work and enjoy life,\u201d the governor said.\n\nGovernors of the states of Ebonyi, Imo, and Abia were served by their deputies.\n\nThe Elders Consultative Forum of Abia State (AECF) has cautioned against militarizing the region.\n\nThe AECF said doing so would be counter-productive in a statement issued by its National President, Archbishop Princewill Ariwodo, and its National Secretary, Rev. Joseph Adiele, at the end of their meeting in Umuahia, Abia State\u2019s capital, yesterday.\n\nIt denounced the military\u2019s arrest of Eze Awurum, who was allegedly labeled as an IPOB supporter, and cautioned against extrajudicial killings of Igbo youths.",

The order of the Governor cannot be enforced for the following reasons:\n\n\u201c1. By the combined effect of the Trade Union Act and the Nigerian Constitution, Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have the unquestionable rights to participate in the peaceful warning strike and mass protests against further retrenchment of workers in the Kaduna State public service.\n\n\u201c2. The Miscellaneous Offences Act is not a state statute but a federal enactment. To that extent, if Governor El Rufai has evidence that Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have contravened any provisions of the Act he is required to lodge a complaint in any of the police stations in Kaduna State. The Governor lacks the power to declare any alleged offender wanted under the Act or any other law whatsoever.\n\n\u201c3.

The identification exercise will be followed by enumeration and validation exercises.\u201d\n\nOkoye added that enumerators would visit applicants at their homes to collect additional information such as their National Identification Number (NIN) and bank account information, and that those who registered would be charged through a digitalized payment system in their bank accounts.\n\nThe commissioner stated that the state government had been collaborating with the federal government on various social intervention programs, which were all aligned with the federal government\u2019s goal of raising 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2025.\n\nWhile reciting the codes, he stated that not everybody in a local council would receive the SMS and that the government had taken sufficient precautions to prevent scams.\n\nBede Okoli, the State Coordinator of SOCU, was present at the briefing, as was Chris Azor, a representative of the Civil Society Network, and Ada Nwokedi, the Information, Education, and Communications Officer of SOCU.",

But none gave any indication of readiness to do so.\n\nAs a result of this problem, Magistrate Judge Ramon Reyes ordered Abidemi Rufai detained and taken to the Western District of Washington, where he committed the offence he has been charged with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the defendant is being detained and will be transported to the Western District of Washington for future court proceedings,\u201d said a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Seattle.\n\nHe will now be taken to Tacoma in Washington state for his next court hearing.\n\nAbidemi was arrested Friday in New York as he prepared to fly to Nigeria,\n\nOn Tuesday, federal prosecutors, according to Seattle Times, had argued that Rufai presented \u201can extreme risk of flight\u201d and had requested that he be held in custody until his trial in federal court in Tacoma.\n\nRufai is charged with stealing more than $350,000 last year by filing fraudulent unemployment claims with the Washington state Employment Security Department (ESD) using the identities of more than 100 Washingtonians. It was the first \u201csignificant\u201d arrest in that fraud, federal officials said.\n\nRufai \u201cdenies any involvement in these transactions,\u201d Barrows, his lawyer, said on Tuesday.\n\nShortly after Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Barrows said he was \u201cseeking alternative surety\u201d and intended to apply again for bail for Rufai.\n\nAlthough defendants sometimes return to court in the afternoon following a morning hearing and seek to reopen a detention case, a spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York said Wednesday that \u201cthere is no second bail hearing scheduled at this time.\u201d",

Those are areas, I am so optimistic we can collaborate on. We are looking to deploy air surveillance across the state in terms of using drones, we can also collaborate in this area, as we see security as an important part of our administration,\u201d Abiodun added.\n\nHe stated that his administration was awaiting the donation of about six ambulances before the end of the week, adding that his administration is also waiting patiently for the Czech government to deliver on its promise to donate ambulances to the state.\n\n\u201cWe are anxiously waiting for those ambulances you promised us. When we assumed office, there were only five ambulances in the state. Today, we have twenty ambulances. I think somebody else is donating about maybe five, six ambulances sometimes this week. So, we have about twenty-six. We aim to have about thirty-five to forty ambulances because we want to have one ambulance per state constituency and we have twenty-six of such constituencies.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is to provide enough ambulances to make that operational. We are providing ambulances in the primary health care centers, tricycle ambulances for pregnant women in that neighbourhood, we are rehabilitating the centers so that they give our people the confidence. At the end of this month, we should have about hundred of those in places, which is about five per local government. We are hoping to do two hundred and thirty-six between now and end of next year.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that once we have our Primary Health Care Centers in place, we can launch our health care insurance programme as well,\u201d Abiodun submitted.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

In the same vein, the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory wanted approval of Peace Corps of Nigeria to establish its formation in all schools and colleges in their various states and I have the written approval to that effect.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the issue that we are duplicating responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Youth Development and the Federal Ministry of Education is completely out of place.\n\n\u201cI want to say Mr. Chairman that based on the dynamic nature of the society, the time has come for the Nigeria Peace Corps to be elevated from the level of volunteerism to that of government driven oprational template.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, in a remark before declaring the public hearing session open , said observations made by President Muhammadu Buhari in the earlier bill refused assent during the 8th National Assembly , have been taken care of , in preventing such re \u2013 occurrence .",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has given assurance that his administration is ready to begin the process of implementing full autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nHe noted that the Judiciary in the state had been accorded full autonomy in line with the law.\n\nOkowa made this known in Asaba when he received the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Marshal Umukoro, who came with other judges in the state\u2019s judiciary to the Government House to intimate the governor of his impending retirement.\n\nAccording to him, with the signing of Judiciary Autonomy law in January, 2021 and the setting up of the relevant committees by the Chief Judge, the state is ready to begin the process of implementing full autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nThe governor stated that the House of Assembly in the state had been enjoying autonomy since two years ago even when some states were yet to start the process till date.\n\n\u201cI have never been against it, and that\u2019s why we went ahead to push for the law. The House of Assembly has been operating their own autonomy since two years even before they started talking about it in this country.\n\n\u201cIt has worked; I have not found any reason to regret that action. So, I believe too that there is no reason why the judiciary cannot run its own autonomy.\n\n\u201cI do also believe that it does not stop the arms of government from relating with each other.\n\n\u201cThe budgets are made on a yearly basis and the only challenge is that many times we are unable to fund it in full. However, what will be released on a monthly basis will be subject to the returns that come from Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC),\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that with the commencement of the full process, the Chief Judge had been empowered to effect his own direct approvals without having to resort to the governor.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to do that because it reduces the number of files on my table. So, I want to announce the full autonomy of the judiciary with the setting up of the committees.\n\n\u201cI am not doing this for any gains. I believe that it\u2019s right and just; I believe too that it\u2019s in the best interest of governance in our nation and that\u2019s how we have also thought about it in the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cI want to generally advise that autonomy does not stop governance from progressing; in fact, it helps governance and I believe that it is something worth doing,\u2019\u2019 Okowa stated\n\nHe thanked judges in the state for their role in ensuring delivery of justice.\n\n\u201cSo my Lord, the Chief Judge, I want to congratulate you for setting up the committee.\n\n\u201cApart from the files that are expected to come to my office, I will advise that no further files should be sent because you are now expected to approve your files by yourself because that\u2019s the process of the autonomy.\n\n\u201cWe thank God that whatever that has a beginning has an end, and I am glad that you have worked so hard to improve on the judicial process in the state.\n\n\u201cI truly appreciate your service to the state and the relationship you kept with the executive arm of government and my family. It was God who made it possible for you to conduct my inauguration in 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary in Delta has continued to walk tall and what I hear happening in other states, I never witnessed it here.\n\n\u201cI have never had cause to worry here and I must thank the Chief Judge and all his brother judges for their cooperation.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer and hope that God will continue to be with you in the course of your retirement,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nEarlier, Justice Umukoro had said that he led the judges to visit the governor as part of the valedictory activities leading to his disengagement as a judicial officer and head of the judicial arm of government in Delta.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to Governor Okowa for his support to him since he became the helmsman of the judiciary in 2015.\n\n\u201cSince I came on board six years ago, you treated me as a brother and I am grateful for your support even during the death of my wife.\n\n\u201cAs Chief Judge of Delta, I can confidently say that we have never had any crisis and we have been able to manage ourselves effectively.\n\n\u201cI am here to deeply appreciate you for supporting me throughout my tenure as Chief Judge of the State and to also thank you for approving the process for the implementation of full autonomy for the state judiciary,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "American rapper T.I. and his wife, Tiny Harris are under investigation for sexual assault and drugging in Los Angeles, months after a string of victims came forward with allegations against the couple spanning multiple US states.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has confirmed the investigation, saying it is currently open after an unnamed woman spoke to police virtually in April.\n\nThe woman is represented by Tyrone A. Blackburn, the attorney who previously sent letters on behalf of multiple victims calling for criminal investigations into T.I. and Tiny in California and Georgia.\n\nThe couple has repeatedly denied all the allegations against them, with their attorney saying the couple has \u201cnot spoken to or been contacted by\u201d police, including in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nThe unnamed L.A. woman claimed in a police report that a man at a mall invited her to a party with T.I. and Tiny. She later met them at a club the next night, sometime between January and May in 2005. The woman remembered having two drinks at the club before Tiny gave her and her friend sips of a clear drink that tasted like Patr\u00f3n tequila but that she did not see Tiny herself drink.\n\nLater, she said she went back to T.I. and Tiny\u2019s hotel room without her friend, who was not allowed to join. She said she was then raped, calling the incident a life-altering trauma.\n\nThe Las Vegas woman, Rachelle Jenks, said she met Tiny in a bathroom at Las Vegas\u2019s McCarran International Airport on August 18, 2010, when she was 30. She said Tiny invited her to a hotel room with her and T.I. that night, and she later met the couple at the Venetian. Jenks said Tiny gave her a Patr\u00f3n shot, and she felt \u201cdizzy and confused\u201d after taking it, per the report. The couple offered Jenks marijuana soon after, which she said she took as well. She later said she performed sexual acts with the couple and told police she believed she was unable to consent because she was given an allegedly spiked drink and drugs. Ms. Jenks said she was then transported to Los Angeles by the couple and again forced to engage in sex acts.\n\nInitial allegations of sexual assault, abuse, and drugging against T.I. and Tiny, described by dozens of alleged victims on Instagram, led the couple\u2019s MTV reality series, T.I. & Tiny: Friends & Family Hustle, to pause filming in February. Around that time, news also came out that T.I. would not return to \u2018Ant-Man 3.\u2019",

          "title": "Analysts Differ on Buhari\u2019s Quest for Fresh $6bn External Loan",
          "text": "Financial analysts and the organised private sector on Tuesday expressed mixed feelings over Nigeria\u2019s rising public debt following a fresh request by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly to approve a $6.18 billion foreign loan.\n\nBefore the latest request, Nigeria\u2019s total external debt stood at $33.348 billion, while total public debt stock as of December 30, 2021, which was released by the DMO in March 2021, stood at N32.915 trillion.\n\nBuhari, in different letters to both chambers of the National Assembly urged the lawmakers to approve his request to borrow N2.3 trillion ($6.18billion) external loan to finance part of the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president in another letter also canvassed a concurrent approval by the legislature for a total sum of $3,837,281,256, \u20ac910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000 for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 federal government external borrowing rolling plan.\n\nThe two request letters, dated May 6, 2021, came a month after the Senate and the House of Representatives approved $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government to finance various priority projects and to support states facing fiscal challenges.\n\nBuhari\u2019s requests were contained in different letters addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThe letters were read at Tuesday plenary by the two presiding officers.\n\nThe president said the request for the N2.3 trillion loan to finance the 2021 budget deficit was in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act), which states that no external loan shall be approved or obtained by the minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution.\n\nAccording to him, the loan will enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, health, education, among others.\n\nHe said the loan would be sourced from a combination of multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nAccording to him, from recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds, and this explains why the federal government is proposing that the new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria may be able to raise $3 billion or more, but not more than $6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five-30 years.\n\nHe said the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approached the market.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201dThe purpose of this letter is to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) provided as new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion. The right honourable speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50 per cent or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081 ,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201dThe Senate President and right honourable Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with Nigeria\u2019s debt management strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nFor concurrent approval of donor fund projects, the president, in the second letter, said the projects would be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China Eximbank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nBuhari explained that the projects and programmes in the borrowing plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations as well as the contributions they would make to the socio-economic development of the country, including employment generation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201dSenate President and the right honourable Speaker may also wish to know that all the listed projects form part of the 2018 2020 external borrowing plan and covered both the federal and state governments\u2019 projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVlD -19 response efforts.\n\n\u201dA summary of some key projects in each of the six geopolitical zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\nGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed borrowing plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the House for 2018 2020 federal government external borrowing (rolling) plan to enable the projects to become effective.\u201d\n\nAnalysts Differ over Borrowing Request\n\nSome of the economic experts who spoke to THISDAY yesterday warned that the current bid to accumulate more public debts would mortgage the future of the country and its future generations.\n\nThey were also worried that the current move is not being done in a transparent manner that would enable Nigerians to know the specific projects the loan would be tied to and the institutions the government intended to borrow from.\n\nHowever, some others believed that the current move to borrow externally would enhance the country\u2019s foreign reserves and stabilise the value of the naira.\n\nOne of those who felt that the federal government should jettison the idea of accessing fresh foreign loan at this period is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nEkpo told THISDAY yesterday that he was worried that the current move by the federal government would worsen Nigeria\u2019s public debt management and subject future generations to financial bondage.\n\nHe advised the government to surgically reduce the bloated cost of governance in the country, warning that the government should be more concerned with its debt to revenue ratio as well as solvency and liquidity ratios because oil, which is its revenue base, is very shaky by depending on exogenous factors that it could not control.\n\nEkpo said the country\u2019s debt-servicing burden was taking almost one-third of Nigeria\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo, we are building debts for future generations to pay. Right now, Nigeria is merely scratching at its debt by servicing it without touching the principal.\u201d\n\nEkpo, who was the immediate past Director-General of the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management is also concerned about the transparency of the proposed borrowing.\n\nThe Director-General of Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, said it would be carelessness on the part of this government to be borrowing and building unsustainable debt burden for future generations and succeeding governments.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escape from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn.\u201d\n\nA professor of Finance, University of Lagos, Prof. Winifred Iyiegbuniwe, warned that Nigeria should not continue to borrow and dissipate them on wasteful expenses.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem is that we cannot continue to be borrowing in this manner and dissipate them through wasteful expenses. I have a problem as a financial economist when I am not convinced of what the government is doing with these borrowings. If we can borrow for specified and identifiable capital projects, fine. But if it is to borrow for consumption, no! We should cut our coat according to our cloth.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that all the long talk about removing fuel and electricity subsidies and plugging loopholes in tax collections are yielding nothing. They seemed to be too much talking with too little action. The only foreign borrowing that will make sense is one that is tied to a specific project. So, the government must be more specific about the infrastructure it intends to finance.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that the plan to borrow $6.18 billion external loan would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves but cautioned that it could also lead to heightened debt burden if not channelled to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Head of Research at Agusto Consulting, Mr. Jimi Ogbobine, said: \u201cThis could help boost foreign reserves at this point in time. But what we need to do is to complement it with other policies like the harmonisation of the exchange rate so we can stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) once again because we cannot survive on using loans to boost our foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nOgbobine, however, noted that \u201cthere are other ways of deficit financing because debt is not the only way of getting financing, which could also be done through taxes and sale of assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at all the unproductive assets and think of how we can get them out of the government\u2019s books in order to reduce recurrent expenditures on these assets,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo, said: \u201cWe know government is constrained with a shortage of fund but it should ensure that major part of the borrowing will go to the productive sector. There is really no harm in borrowing as long as it is used for productive purposes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, expressed concern that the rising debt profile of the federal government might not be sustainable because the debts will become a problem when the revenue base is not strong enough to service them.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to cut expenditure and undertake reforms that could scale down the size of government, reduce governance cost and ease the fiscal burden on the government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the debt should be used strictly to fund capital projects that would strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nHe also advised government to shift \u201cemphasis to concessionary financing against commercial debts that are typically very costly.\u201d\n\nAPC Mortgaging Future, Says PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday raised the alarm over another plan by the federal government to borrow N2.3 trillion.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told THISDAY that the additional loan request would mortgage the future of generations yet unborn Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are alarmed like any other Nigerian on this fresh loan request. It is simply to mortgage the nation and the future of the younger ones as they will be held in bondage by debts.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing is that upon all these loans, there is nothing tangible to show with the loans so far obtained. As a party and as Nigerians, we are worried. What is simply happening is just mis-governance and incompetence In all these multiple loans, the truth is that you cannot point any finger and say, this is what the Buhari administration has done with it.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos",
