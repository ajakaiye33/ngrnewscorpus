          "text": "An Ikeja High Court in Lagos has discharged and acquitted a part-time Arabic teacher, Mr. Anisere Sulaimon, of a defilement and sexual assault charge after he spent almost four years in detention.\n\nJustice R. A. Oshodi held that there was no prima facie case against Sulaimon, who was a final year student of the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education at the time of his arrest in 2018.\n\nSulaimon, of Abesan Estate, Ipaja, Lagos was accused of defiling and sexually assaulting a then four-year-old child at Mahadu Ridwanullah Arabic and Islamic School, Opeki in Abesan Estate.\n\nHe denied committing the offence.\n\nHis counsel, Mr. Ahmed Adetola-Kazeem, filed a no-case submission, which the court upheld.\n\nThe judge agreed with Adetola-Kazeem, that apart from Sulaimon denying the charge, the prosecution\u2019s lone witness (Mercy Oluranti) also testified that she was aware that it was a relation of the child that used to have carnal knowledge of her.\n\nThe court noted that the witness said one Kehinde Adedeji, who is an uncle to the child, confessed to the crime of defiling the four-year-old.\n\nJustice Oshodi held: \u201cThe prosecution has not made out a sufficient case to warrant the defendant being directed to put up a defence to count 1. I uphold the no-case submission in relation to this count and, therefore, accordingly discharge and acquit the defendant on this count.\n\n\u201cCount 2. relates to the same victim, but this time, the penetration of her vagina in a sexual manner by the defendant.\u201d\n\nThe court observed that the witness did not witness the alleged offences, adding that, like for count one, \u201cthe evidence of PWI does not raise a prima facie case,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no ground for proceeding with defence, I hold that the no-case submission succeeds. The Defendant, Anisere Sulaiman, is accordingly discharged and acquitted.\u201d\n\nOn June 5, 2018, Sulaimon was brought before an Ikeja Magistrates\u2019 Court on the allegation of defilement and sexual assault and remanded at the Kirikiri facility.\n\nThe Magistrate, Mrs. B.O. Osunsanmi, ordered that he be kept behind bars pending advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).\n\nEarlier, the prosecutor, Mr. Ezekiel Ayorinde alleged that Sulaimon committed the offence in 2017 at his mosque.\n\nThe case was adjourned until July 9, 201,8 for mention.\n\nFollowing the DPP\u2019s report, the case was subsequently moved to the High Court and Sulaimon was arraigned on October 9, 2019, before Justice Sybil Nwaka.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to an amended two-count charge.\n\nBut the case was transferred to another court when Justice Nwaka was elevated to the Court of Appeal.\n\nSulaimon was then re-arraigned before Justice R. A. Oshodi on July 27, 2021.\n\nHe was again accused of defilement and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nBoth offences were contained in an amended charge dated October 8, 2019.\n\nHe pleaded \u201cNot guilty\u201d and the trial commenced on November 8, 2021.",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nZenith Bank Plc has announced an impressive result for the year ended December 31, 2021 as it recorded a double-digit growth of 10 per cent in gross earnings which rose to N765.6 billion from N696.5 billion reported in the previous year.\n\nThis was despite a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited financial results for the 2021 financial year presented to the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX), the Group achieved 10 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings on the back of 23 per cent YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7 billion to N309 billion and a two per cent YoY growth in interest income from N420.8 billion to N427.6 billion.\n\nAlso, Zenith Bank\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) grew by 10 per cent from N255.9 billion to N280.4 billion in the current year under review. The increase in PBT was due to growth in the bank\u2019s top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12 per cent from N121.1 billion in 2020 to N106.8 billion in the year under review.\n\nThis further led to a seven per cent increase in net interest income of N320.8 billion in 2021, from N299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nIts customer deposits increased by 21 per cent, growing from N5.34 trillion in the previous year to N6.47 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. For instance, while retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the current year.\n\nAlthough operating expenses grew by 13 per cent YoY, growth remained below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by six per cent from N7.34 to N7.78.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s total assets also increased by 11 per cent, growing from N8.48 trillion in 2020 to N9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits. With the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group prudently grew its gross loans by 20 per cent, from N2.9 trillion in 2020 to N3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated non-performing loan (NPL) ratio from 4.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent YoY.\n\nFurthermore, the Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6 per cent and 21 per cent, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.\n\nIn 2022, the Group intends to consolidate on the gains achieved in the previous year in all business segments and combine leadership in the industry, innovation and technology to drive improved performance and deliver enhanced returns to all stakeholders.\n\nAs a testament to its commitment to its shareholders, the bank has announced a proposed final dividend pay-out of N2.80 per share, bringing the total dividend to N3.10 per share.\n\nZenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. The bank remains a clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in deploying innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom.

          "text": "Warns Americans in Russia to leave immediately\n\nFG to Begin Airlifting Nigerians Trapped in Ukraine on Wednesday\n\nSwitzerland to freeze Putin, others\u2019 assets\n\nRussia faces financial meltdown, ruble crashes as penalties bite its economy\n\nFIFA, UEFA ban Russia\n\nUkraine calls for \u2018immediate ceasefire\u2019 as talks with Russia open\n\nMichael Olugbode and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Mary Nnah and Funmi Ogundare in Lagos with agency report\n\nThe cost of the on-going war between Russia and Ukraine on the Russian economy is growing by the day, as the country is increasingly being isolated. As part of the move to punish Russia for invading Ukraine, the United States yesterday said it was taking immediate steps to prohibit American dollar transactions with the Russian central bank and fully block the Russian direct investment fund.\n\nUS senior administration officials disclosed that the aggressive move was aimed at some of Russia\u2019s most powerful means of mitigating the effect of sanctions.\n\nIn addition, the US Embassy in Russia warned US nationals to consider leaving \u201cimmediately\u201d due to the rising number of airlines that are cancelling flights in and out of the country and closing their airspace to Russian airlines.\n\nThat was as indications emerged yesterday that the federal government might have secured 479 Nigerians in the effort to take citizens out of Ukraine amid the Russian attack.\n\nThe steps by the US to cut dollar supply to Russia were meant to prevent Russia from accessing a \u201crainy day fund\u201d that officials said Moscow had been expecting to rely upon during the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAgainst plans to use the reserves to buffer a plummeting ruble, Russia would no longer be able to access the funds it keeps in US dollars, according to CNN.\n\nThe sweeping new sanctions \u2013 taken with Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada, the European Union and others \u2013 came as Russia\u2019s economy is already in free-fall.\n\n\u201cNo country is sanction proof,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cPutin\u2019s war chest of $630 billion in reserves only matters if you can use it to defend his currency, specifically by selling those reserves in exchange for buying the ruble. After today\u2019s actions that will no longer be possible, and fortress Russia will be exposed as a myth.\u201d\n\nIn a phone call with reporters Monday morning, a senior US administration official said the move was \u201cthe culmination of months of planning and preparation across our respective governments across technical, diplomatic and political channels, including at the highest levels.\u201d\n\nCNN quoted the official as saying, \u201cWe were ready and that\u2019s what allowed us to act within days, not weeks or months, of Putin\u2019s escalation.\n\n\u201cOur strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to mitigate the impact of the sanctions on US and European energy consumers, the Treasury Department would exempt most energy-related transactions from the sanctions, a significant carve-out in the sanctions.\n\nOne official called the on-going sanctions a \u201cvicious feedback loop that\u2019s triggered by Putin\u2019s own choices and accelerated by his own aggression.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions also fully block the Russian Direct Investment Fund and its CEO, Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nAnother official said they were \u201csymbols of deep seated Russian corruption and influence peddling globally.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions represent the most significant actions the US Treasury has taken against an economy of this size and assets of this size.\n\n\u201cWhat also makes this asset significant is not just the amount of assets or the size of the country we\u2019re targeting, but the speed at which our partners and allies have worked with us to enact this response.\u201d\n\nAsked about potential additional sanctions on Belarus, which appears poised to elevate its role in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, an official said the US was watching events \u201cvery carefully\u201d and that sanctions on Belarus would \u201ccontinue to ratchet much higher.\u201d\n\nBattles continued Monday near several key Ukrainian cities as Russia presses further into the country.\n\nRussian forces are facing \u201cstiff resistance\u201d with slowing momentum in northern Ukraine, a US defense official said, while invading troops are having a \u201clittle bit more success\u201d in the south.\n\nRussian forces have \u201cslowed their offensive\u201d but are \u201cstill trying\u201d to take Ukrainian ground around the country, according to the Ukrainian military.\n\nTalks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations also got underway Monday in Belarus. In the lead-up to the meeting, Ukraine demanded an \u201cimmediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops.\u201d\n\nMore than 500,000 refugees have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries after the beginning of the invasion, the United Nations Refugee Agency said Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked European countries to do more to support his nation on Monday asked the European Union to \u201curgently admit Ukraine\u201d to the bloc.\n\nA new CNN poll showed Americans overwhelmingly support increased economic sanctions against Russia and broadly support further action to stop Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but most oppose direct US military action.\n\nEighty-three per cent of Americans said they favoured increased economic sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion, with just 17 per cent opposed.\n\nUS Embassy Warns Americans in Russia to Consider Leaving Immediately\n\nThe US Embassy in Russia warned US nationals that they should consider leaving \u201cimmediately\u201d due to the rising number of airlines cancelling flights in and out of the country and countries closing their airspace to Russian airlines.\n\nThe embassy said in an advisory, \u201cAn increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines. US citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.\n\n\u201cThe US Embassy reminds US citizens that the Department of State\u2019s Travel Advisory level for Russia is at \u2018Level 4: Do Not Travel.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfricans Stranded at Ukraine-Poland border\n\nNigeria and South Africa expressed alarm at reports that their nationals were being stopped from leaving war-torn Ukraine. At Lviv train station, in western Ukraine, FRANCE 24 met several African students who said they were pushed back at the Medyka border crossing with Poland.\n\nHowever, African governments yesterday scrambled to help their nationals escape the Russian invasion in Ukraine, as reports emerged of racist and unfair treatment of their citizens at the border with Poland. The reports, denied by both Polish and Ukrainian officials, cast a pall on the massive evacuation effort that had already seen half a million civilians cross into the European Union.\n\nWhile some Africans had been able to leave Ukraine, FRANCE 24 spoke to several students at Lviv train station in western Ukraine who said they were turned back by Ukrainian border guards while attempting to cross into Poland.\n\n\u201cThey stopped us at the border and told us that Blacks were not allowed. But we could see White people going through,\u201d said Moustapha Bagui Sylla, a student from Guinea. He said he fled his university residence in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, as soon as the bombing began.\n\nLike thousands of Ukrainian civilians scrambling for the border, the young Guinean said he walked for hours in freezing temperatures heading for the Polish frontier village of Medyka \u2013 only to be ordered to turn back.\n\nMoustapha Bagui Sylla had been studying medicine in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv for the past year.\n\nAnother student from Nigeria described similar scenes at the border crossing. He said his group, which included women, was shut out of the border post even as White people were let through.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t let Africans in. Blacks without European passports cannot cross the border. They\u2019re pushing us back just because we\u2019re Black!\u201d said the Nigerian student, who gave only his first name, Michael. \u201cWe\u2019re all human,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should not discriminate against us because of the colour of our skin.\u201d\n\nJean Ngando, a French teacher from Cameroon, said he was looking for alternative routes to avoid being pushed back at the Polish border, France 24 reported.\n\nAccording to Bagui Sylla, the Ukrainian border guards said they were merely following instructions from their Polish counterparts \u2013 a claim denied by officials in Warsaw.\n\nAnna Michalska, a spokesperson for the Polish border guards, said she had spent \u201cthe past two days denying such allegations\u201d.\n\nShe told FRANCE 24, \u201cI don\u2019t know what is happening on the Ukrainian side of the border, but we let everyone in regardless of nationality.\u201d\n\nIn a later communiqu\u00e9, Polish officials confirmed that no visas were required to cross the border and that identity cards and passports would be accepted, even when expired.\n\nNigerian student Natacha Daniels said she was worried she would be barred from leaving Ukraine because her passport was in the hands of officials in Kharkiv, where she studies economics.\n\nFG to Begin Airlifting Nigerians Trapped in Ukraine on Wednesday\n\n\u2022479 Nigerians Secure Exit Routes\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama, yesterday, said the federal government will on Wednesday start airlifting Nigerians trapped at the Ukrainian borders with Budapest, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania. Onyeama disclosed this while speaking on Channels TV, Politics Today, monitored in Lagos, against the backdrop of resettlement plans for Nigerians trapped in Ukraine. He said the government was discussing with Air Peace and Max Air airlines in Abuja, adding that it is making moves to find out from those countries how many Nigerians are currently there.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs of today, we were hoping we will be able to get the flights out, but we needed to be sure of the numbers to know the size of planes to deploy. So we made Romania the hub.\u201d\n\nThe minister said he was in touch with the Ambassador in Ukraine and his staff and had directed them to set up a hotline for Nigerians in Ukraine, maintain contact with them, and advise them on what they should be doing and how they should stay safe.\n\nOnyeama said, \u201cWe are also in contact with the ambassadors and diplomatic missions around Ukraine. Once the people started moving to the borders before it was shut; we have started evacuating Nigerian citizens. The next phase was to get them to the borders as safely as possible and to evacuate them to the capitals to begin an airlift.\u201d\n\nHe added that it got the embassy to send staff to the border points in Hungary, Poland and Romania, Slovakia to assist Nigerians to arrange shelter and food for them.\n\nOnyeama stated, \u201cThough it\u2019s a bit chaotic because of the panic. There has been some distressing news about discrimination about Nigerians being turned back at the border, initially, by the guards. So I called the minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine. I was actually surprised to get him considering the situation that they are in, and we communicated at length and he said the border guards were to allow foreigners to go through unimpeded, but the only restrictions were Ukrainian males between the ages of 18 and 60. And the borders guards have been directed. So we arranged with the embassy officials to start ferrying Nigerians to the capitals.\u201d\n\nHe said there were over 1,000 Nigerians who had crossed the borders, 250 in Poland, Budapest about 200, and Slovakia rising rapidly to around 200 mark.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cThere are some Nigerians on a place called Summi, closer to the Russian border. I have been in touch with the ambassador and given him some numbers to keep in touch with them, about 150 of them now looking to cross to Russia, we are hoping they will give them a permit to cross and we are hoping that by Wednesday, we will start deploying planes to airlifting and bringing back Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was safe to fly in and out of Russia, Onyeama said it was not safe to fly, but to go by road, adding that there is also inherent risk.\n\n\u201cThough there is an element of risk there but the Russian Ambassador assured me that they were targeting military installations and not civilian abode,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nMeanwhile, about 479 Nigerians are already across the Ukrainian border in Hungary and Poland with the rest as at press time being assisted to get to freedom.\n\nA signed statement yesterday by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Gabriel Aduda, explained, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, officials of the Nigerian Embassy have received 130 Nigerians safely at Bucharest, Romania, where they have been provided accommodation and will be documented, while we finalise arrangements to bring them back home.\n\n\u201cAlso, officials at Budapest, Hungary have received and accommodated 74 Nigerians safely, where they are being documented for subsequent travel arrangements back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting another batch of about 200 into the city of Budapest, tomorrow (Monday)\n\n\u201cIn Warsaw, Poland we have received 52 Nigerians and 23 are being processed at the Polish Government Reception Point at Hala Kijowska, Milny 90, 37-552 Milny, which is near the border of Korczowa-Krakowiec. The camp is well organised with beds and beddings, food, heating, clothing and medicals for evacuees.\u201d\n\nAduda, in the statement, assured \u201cNigerians that all hands are on deck and arrangements are being put in place to effectively evacuate our citizens, in safety and dignity.\u201d\n\nFIFA, UEFA Ban Russia from World Football\n\nIn an unusual move, FIFA and UEFA, two of the preeminent governing bodies in world soccer yesterday announced that, \u201call Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice.\u201d\n\nThe unprecedented decision came just weeks before the Russian national team was set to face off against Poland in a single-leg semi-final for the chance to advance to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe announcement marked a change in course for FIFA, which just a day earlier had announced Russia would not be eliminated from qualification but rather play using the \u201cRFU\u201d acronym for the country\u2019s soccer federation.\n\nAccording to FOX News, the prior announcement prompted outrage across the world, with soccer legends such as Englishman Gary Neville opining, \u201cWhat about FIFA? The most corrupt organisation in the sporting world for decades just can\u2019t rid itself of dodge-pot leaders.\u201d\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s statement however, FIFA and UEFA stated, \u201cFootball is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.\u201d\n\nRussia, which hosted the 2018 World Cup and advanced to the quarter-finals, is currently the 35th ranked team in the world and is known to be a sport enjoyed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe about-face from FIFA drew immediate praise from pundits on social media, with BBC commentator and English football legend Gary Lineker tweeting, \u201cWell done FIFA. The right call.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Russian national team being suspended from international competitions, UEFA\u2019s inclusion in the joint announcement signalled the halt of Russian club teams from playing in European cup competitions such as the Champions League and Europa League.\n\nWhile no Russian team advanced to the knockout stages of the Champions League, one team, Spartak Moscow, will likely be forced to forfeit their Europa League Round of 16 match vs German-side Red Bull Leipzig that was set for March 10th.\n\nUEFA also added to Monday\u2019s statement in a tweet, announcing that in addition to the suspension, the soccer organisation would be ending its partnership with Russian majority state owned energy corporation, Gazprom.\n\n\u201cUEFA has today decided to end its partnership with Gazprom across all competitions. The decision is effective immediately and covers all existing agreements including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA national team competitions and UEFA EURO 2024,\u201d the tweet read.\n\nThe moves from UEFA follow Friday\u2019s decision from the organisation to move the UEFA Champions League Final in May from St. Petersburg, Russia, to Paris, France.\n\nSwitzerland to Freeze Russian Assets\n\nSwitzerland, a favourite destination for Russian oligarchs and their money, yesterday announced that it would freeze Russian financial assets in the country, setting aside a deeply rooted tradition of neutrality to join the European Union and a growing number of nations seeking to penalise Russia for the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAfter a meeting with the Swiss Federal Council, Switzerland\u2019s president, Ignazio Cassis, said the country would immediately freeze the assets of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin; its Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, as well as all 367 individuals sanctioned last week by the European Union.\n\nSwitzerland said it was departing from its usual policy of neutrality because of, \u201cthe unprecedented military attack by Russia on a sovereign European state,\u201d but expressed a willingness to help mediate in the conflict.\n\nIt also joined European neighbours in closing its airspace to Russian aircraft, except for humanitarian or diplomatic purposes.\n\nBut said it would evaluate whether to join in subsequent EU sanctions on a case-by-case basis.\n\nLavrov, who was scheduled to be in Geneva today to address the United Nations Human Rights Council, would no longer make the trip because of the flight ban, Russia\u2019s mission to the United Nations in Geneva said on Twitter.\n\nSwiss national bank data showed that Russian companies and individuals held assets worth more than $11 billion in Swiss banks in 2020. As a hub for the global commodities trade, Switzerland also hosts numerous companies that trade Russian oil and other commodities.\n\nThe decision came amid mounting condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which saw thousands of anti-war protesters march in Bern, Switzerland\u2019s capital, over the weekend. Demonstrators chanted for an end to \u201cPutin\u2019s war\u201d and criticised the government\u2019s initially cautious response to the crisis.\n\nSwitzerland cherishes a reputation for neutrality that has established Geneva as a home to the United Nations and a host to peace talks in numerous conflicts, including the wars in Korea and Vietnam. Recently, Geneva was the venue for last year\u2019s summit between President Biden and Mr. Putin.\n\nCassis expressed concerns that the Alpine nation\u2019s credibility as a neutral diplomatic intermediary would suffer if it automatically followed suit with E.U. sanctions.\n\nInitially, Switzerland said last week that it would enforce travel bans against Russians on the E.U. sanctions list and stop Swiss banks from accepting new Russian money \u2014 but stopped short of cutting off the individuals\u2019 access to their bank accounts.\n\nRussia Faces Financial Meltdown, Ruble Crashes as Sanctions Bites Harder\n\nHowever, Russia was scrambling to prevent financial meltdown yesterday as its economy was slammed by a broadside of crushing Western sanctions imposed in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPutin was due to hold crisis talks with his top advisers after the ruble crashed to a record low against the US dollar, the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20 per cent and the Moscow stock exchange was shuttered for the day.\n\nThe European subsidiary of Russia\u2019s biggest bank was on the brink of collapse as savers rushed to withdraw their deposits. Economists warned that the Russian economy could shrink by five per cent.\n\nAccording to the CNN, the ruble lost about 20 per cent of its value to trade at 100 to the dollar yesterday, after earlier plummeting as much as 40 per cent. The start of trading on the Russian stock market was delayed, and then canceled entirely, according to a statement from the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nThe latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and \u201cparalyse\u201d the assets of Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cThe ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,\u201d wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe will \u2026 ban the transactions of Russia\u2019s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin\u2019s war,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they would become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\n\u201cThis weekend\u2019s events now mean that no G7 banks will be able to buy Russian rubles, sending the currency into free-fall, with the end result we could see a huge inflationary shock unfold inside Russia,\u201d Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.\n\n\u201cA run on Russian banks inside the country appears to be already starting, as ordinary Russians fear that their credit cards might no longer work,\u201d he added.\n\nUkraine Calls for \u2018Immediate Ceasefire\u2019 as Talks with Russia Open\n\nRussia and Ukraine met yesterday for their first talks since the outbreak of war last week, with Kyiv demanding an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d as the number of refugees fleeing the country hit more than 500,000.\n\nAccording to the AFP, as the delegations arrived for talks on the border between Belarus and Ukraine on day five of Moscow\u2019s invasion, the Ukrainian presidency demanded the ceasefire \u201cand the withdrawal of troops\u201d \u2014 which Moscow is almost certain to reject.\n\n\u201cI do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nIn the capital yesterday, after a relatively calm evening, people rushed out to buy food after the lifting of a strict blanket curfew imposed Saturday, with local forces given shoot-on-sight orders over the weekend.\n\nKyiv had been initially reluctant to send a delegation to Belarus, given the country\u2019s role in facilitating Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine by hosting troops and weaponry used in the invasion.\n\n\u201cWe definitely have an interest in reaching some agreements as soon as possible,\u201d Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin who had travelled to Belarus for the talks, said in televised remarks.\n\nZelensky meanwhile issued another video address, wearing his now trademark green khaki sweatshirt, calling on the European Union to agree to \u201cthe immediate accession of Ukraine via a new special procedure.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Minister of the Federal Capital Territory FCT, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe minister disclosed this on his official Facebook page on Friday.\n\nHe said; \u201cI have tested positive for COVID-19. After a hide and seek period spanning 21 months (1yr 9 months) between COVID-19 and my humble self, the virus finally caught up with me during the dying days of 2021.\n\n\u201cAfter feeling unwell from 28th December, I decided to do a COVID-19 test yesterday morning.\n\n\u201cThe result came out positive this morning. Currently doing fine, with some sore throat, feverish feeling and mild running nose. Undertaking treatment and isolation at home.\n\n\u201cI salute and wish all the medical personnel in the FCT and beyond who have been in the front line fighting this pandemic a happy and prosperous new year 2022. I pray for the quick recovery of all of us currently afflicted with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI have been informed by the experts that my case is mild because I took two shots of the COVID-19 vaccine.

I filed a case which is still pending at the federal high court challenging the constitutionality of that, it was pursuant to that they wanted to amend the constitution so that they could insert that provision into the constitution to cure the defect in the Legislative Privileges Act,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe that it is unnecessary conferment of protection on the national assembly. Extending it to the CJN is an attempt to bribe the judiciary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA judicial officer is protected under the constitution so far as a judge can\u2019t be sued by an act done by himself in his official capacity. The same thing goes for every member of the national assembly. That has been an ancient privilege. They can\u2019t be sued for comments made on the floor of the house. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nAnother senior advocate, Afam Osigwe said immunity will be abused if it is granted to more public officers.\n\n\u201cIn every part of the world, immunity is granted only to the president and even the ones granted to the executives is limited, if you commit an offence while in office it may be a ground to take away the immunity. I don\u2019t see why we should grant immunity to the CJN. It is not done,\u201d Osigwe said.\n\n\u201cWe just want to abuse the immunity, is it even not bad enough that we don\u2019t investigate or trial when they leave office and we now want to confer immunity on them while in office? That\u2019s sad. They should not be allowed to get away with this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Ifedayo Adedipe, a senior advocate, said the presiding officers of the national assembly do not deserve immunity.\n\n\u201cIt is not right to extend immunity to this set of people. We should open the democratic space and access to the court,\u201d Adedipe said.\n\n\u201cIf you have a problem with the conducts of presiding officers in the national assembly how are you going to bring them to justice if you confer immunity on them? I do not support it and I do not think it should be passed into law.\n\n\u201cAre you not aware that in some countries sitting prime ministers are being taken to court? It happened in Israel. Are they going to be committing legal infractions that would be taking them to court every now and then? They do not need immunity.\u201d",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

BOLA TINUBU\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, fondly called Asiwaju of Lagos, and Jagaban (a title given to him in Borgu kingdom, Niger State) was born in Osun State, South West, Nigeria. He attended St. John\u2019s Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos and Children\u2019s Home School in Ibadan, Nigeria. Tinubu went to the United States to study at the phenomenal Richard J. Dailey College in Chicago, Illinois at the age of 23. He later obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration (Accounting and Management).\n\nTinubu is a Muslim who got married to Oluremi Tinubu, who is the current senator representing Lagos Central Senatorial District. He is blessed with four children namely JideTinubu (now late), Oluwaseyi Tinubu, Folashade Tinubu (Iyaloja general), and Abibat Tinubu.\n\nCAREER\n\nTinubu started his career when he worked for the renowned American-based organisation, Authur Anderson, Deloitte Haskins and Sells (which is now called Deloitte Haskins and Touche), where he practised auditing and management consultancy services of General Motors and also, he worked for one of the largest communication and utility companies in the United States of America, GTE Service Corporation. He also served at Mobil, United Kingdom.\n\nTinubu returned to Nigeria in 1983, and joined Mobil Oil, Nigeria. He eventually became a senior auditor in Mobil Oil, and retired as the company\u2019s treasurer.\n\nPOLITICAL CAREER\n\nTinubu\u2019s political career in Nigeria began in 1992, when he joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and was also elected as a senator in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, where he represented Lagos West Senatorial District. Tinubu became the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Finance, Appropriation and Currency at the National Assembly. He further became one of the founding members of National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) which was a body that rooted for the winner of the June 12, 1993 election.\n\nHe was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Abraham Adesanya and Ayo Adebanjo, leaders of Alliance for Democracy (AD). He defeated his opponents, Funsho Williams and Wahab Dosunmu. In the 1999 gubernatorial election, he won the position of governor of Lagos State.\n\nTinubu as the governor of Lagos State between 1999 and 2007 made investments in education, initiated new road construction, required to meet the needs of the fast-growing population rate of the state at the time. Just as he won the election in 1999, he was also re-elected as the governor, and his deputy, Femi Pedro in 2003, where he was the only governor in the south west who didn\u2019t fall through to PDP.\n\nTinubu was also very active in the creation of the Action Congress (AC) political party. Tinubu was succeeded by Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN), who was his Chief of staff. He is currently the national leader for the All Progressives Congress.\n\nBUSINESS\n\nTinubu is said to have interest in the popular television station, TVC Nigeria, Lekki Concession Company, Apapa Amusement Park, Maiyegun Land Project, The Nation Newspaper, Renaissance Hotel, Ikeja Shopping Mall, Radio Continental, Alpha Beta Consulting, Royal Gardens Estate, Tejuoso Market (Joint ownership).\n\n2. ATIKU ABUBAKAR\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAtiku Abubakar a Nigerian politician was born in Jada, a village which was formerly under the administration of the British Cameroons, which later joined Nigeria. He became the only child to his parents, Garba Abubakar and Aisha Kande when his only sister died at infancy. Abubakar is married to four wives and has been blessed with twenty-eight children.\n\nAt an early age of eight, Abubakar started schooling at the Jada Primary School, Adamawa, which he completed in 1960. In the same year, Abubakar was admitted into Adamawa Provincial Secondary School. He graduated from the secondary school in 1965 after he made grade three in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination.\n\nAbubakar continued to study at the Nigeria Police College in Kaduna. He progressed to work as a tax officer in the regional Ministry of Finance; he gained admission to the School of Hygiene in Kano in 1966, where he finished with a diploma.\n\nHe served as a student Union President at the time, and in the same year he enrolled for a Law diploma at the Ahmadu Bello University Institute of Administration.\n\nCAREER\n\nAbubakar was employed by the Nigeria Custom Service after graduation in 1969. He is known to be a serial entrepreneur; he served with the Nigeria Customs Services for twenty years, and at some point, became the Deputy Director, the second highest position held within the system.\n\nPOLITICAL CAREER\n\nAbubakar has been into the government system for a long time, precisely 1980s. He was elected the National Vice-chairman of the Peoples Front of Nigeria (PFN) which was denied registration by the military government. The PFN merged with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) when Abubakar contested and won the SDP primaries in November 1991, and got disqualified by the government.

On the 31st of March 2015, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) confirmed the Buhari/Osinbajo ticket having won the Presidential election, thus Osinbajo became the Vice President-elect of Nigeria. They were both sworn in on the 29th of May 2015 for the first term. In February 2019, the Buhari/ Osinbajo ticket won the Presidential Elections for a second term in office starting May 29, 2019.\n\nBUSINESS\n\nYemi founded the Orderly Society Trust (OST) involved in an Excel literacy programme that aims to provide children in public primary schools with the same level of training in English as is available to their counterparts in private schools.

          "text": "In a rare move, Nigeria\u2019s 36 state governors under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) have united to resist a plan by the Senate and Ministry of Power to stop states from activating innovative solutions to solving Nigeria\u2019s power problems through a proposed electricity bill.\n\nUnlike the Value Added Tax (VAT) \u2018war\u2019 where there was discordance, the state governors have united in picking holes in the proposed electricity bill, saying it works against the interest of the states as it seeks to re-establish a centrally controlled electricity sector.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the NGF raised red flag about the harmful consequences in placing the minister in direct control of the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the various agencies, including the Independent System Operator (ISO).\n\nFor instance, Section 5(b) of the proposed electricity bill states, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Minister shall be responsible for the determination, formulation and monitoring of government policy for the Nigerian electricity supply industry and perform the following functions including other functions assigned to him under this Bill and other Acts of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe bill added that Nigeria\u2019s minister of power shall exercise general supervision over the affairs and operations of the Commission and agencies established under this bill, \u201cand for this purpose give general and specific policy direction including directions on overall system planning and coordination to the Commission or agencies established under this Bill, which the Commission or the agencies shall take into consideration in discharging their respective functions.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly this Bill is simply a means to amass wider ministerial and legislative powers and make these two stakeholders the dominant players in the sector,\u201d the NGF said in a statement signed by its executive secretary, Ashisana Okauru, on Monday.\n\nThe governors also raised concern on the oversight responsibility of the National Assembly or its Committees, which allows the Senate a \u201csupervisory powers of any government Ministry over government-owned enterprises such as Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company plc, Transmission Company of Nigeria plc (TCN) or other entities operating in the Nigerian electricity supply industry in which government has not divested its equity holdings, and irrespective of the Ministry where such entities are placed for administrative supervision by the Ministry.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to see how section five and section six can work in practice to improve the credibility of NERC and the performance of the sector,\u201d the NGF warned.\n\nIn another letter, signed by Kayode Fayemi, the chairman of NGF and Ekiti State governor, the governors said the proposed bill was injurious to the states in the country with regard to generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in their domain.\n\n\u201cThe proposed electricity bill makes Nigeria\u2019s minister of power a defacto GMD, something similar to what we have with the NNPC and its subsidiaries,\u201d Eyo Ekpo, former commissioner at the NERC, told BusinessDay.\n\nRead also: Women in industry: Upskilling for a transitional energy industry\n\nFayemi argued that the bill, which is expected to be presented on Tuesday at the Senate, \u201cIs based on recommendations put together by a team of consultants engaged by the Senate Committee on Power.\u201d\n\nThe letter further said, \u201cThe Electricity Bill by the Senate Committee on Power is not a true and fair reflection of stakeholders in the Nigerian electricity sector, most particularly the state governments. It is also not a true and fair reflection of the Federal Executive arm.\u201d\n\nThe governors noted that Clause 2(2) of the Bill is rather injurious to the constitutional rights of States with regards to electricity generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nThey, therefore, argued that limiting the powers of states to build generation plants, transmission and distribution lines only in areas not covered by the national grid shrinks the powers of the states to make laws for electricity within their jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cWe wish to point out that \u2018electricity\u2019 is not an exclusively federal matter. It is guided by the provisions of the Concurrent Legislative List. Articles 13 and 14 clearly provide that the power to make laws for the generation and transmission of electricity are concurrent,\u201d the letter read in part.\n\nAccording to the governors, past efforts of states to establish and sustain electricity markets of their own have been stifled by the Federal Government, citing efforts of Lagos and Rivers states as examples.\n\nThe letter further pointed out that states like Lagos, Edo, Ekiti, Ondo and Kaduna have already taken the initiative to enact policy statements and laws for the electricity sectors in their states.\n\nA similar policy is being championed by the 19 states of Northern Nigeria, they noted, pointing out that these states have come together to establish a common platform for realising the benefits of the extensive renewable energy resources that their region is blessed with.\n\n\u201cIt would be unconstitutional and an unjustifiable act of overreach for the Senate to consider and pass a Bill that continues to treat the Federation as one single electricity jurisdiction or sector,\u201d the governors argued.\n\nThey explained, \u201cWhile a single Electric Power Sector Reform Act may have been useful as a catalyst for the sector in the early years of the Fourth Republic, the states have all come of age, literally and metaphorically, and the arrangements must change in a way that accepts and respects the maturity of the states in electricity matters; a reality that this Senate Electricity Bill does not recognise and take account of but at best only pays the most cursory lip service.\u201d\n\nThe governors added, \u201cThe NGF does not support this Electricity Bill in the version currently before the Senate, except these amendments are reflected. This is because it is unconstitutional and maintains the policy of Federal Government overreach in the electricity sector that has not yielded development to the country.\n\n\u201cThe governors recommend the constitution of a Working Group, spearheaded by the State Governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council (NEC), to work with the NASS leadership on the way forward for the electricity sector.\n\n\u201cFrom this should emerge a new National Electricity Policy and the foundations of a new Act of the National Assembly that, for the first time, will have the full buy-in of the States,\u201d they concluded.",

          "text": "Russia soldiers appear to be advancing their invasion of Ukraine with satellite imagery indicating that a long convoy of Russian military vehicles is heading towards Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv.\n\nThe convoy which is some 40 miles or 65 kilometers long was captured in satellite image taken by U.S firm Maxar Technologies on Monday.\n\nIt appears to show a convoy of Russian armored tanks and trucks that stretches from Pybirsk, further north of Kyiv, to the Antonov airport (also known as the Hostemel airport \u2014 the site of fighting last week between Russian and Ukrainian forces) on the northeast outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, CNBC reported.\n\nIn some parts of the convoy, the vehicles appear to be traveling three or four abreast on the road. The distance along the road is approximately 40 miles.\n\nIt should be noted that the situation in Ukraine is fast-moving and may now may be different to what is seen in these images, which show the convoy on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe following two images were taken by Maxar Technologies on Sunday. At this point, the convoy does not appear to cover as large an area and cloud cover precludes a complete view of the area.\n\nOfficial sources have not confirmed the existence of the convoy, but there are fears it suggests that Russia is preparing to launch a full-scale assault on Kyiv, a city it has not yet occupied although there have been skirmishes on the outskirts, according to CNBC.\n\nOther images from Maxar suggest additional military activity in southern Belarus, which borders Ukraine and is an ally of Russia, with ground forces and ground-attack helicopter units seen in the images. Again, official sources have not confirmed whether these units \u2014 or Belarus more broadly \u2014 is preparing to join Russian forces in an assault on Ukraine.\n\nRussia began its invasion of Ukraine last Thursday and its forces have attacked various cities and areas in the north, east and south of the country. However, analysts have suggested that Russia had made slower progress in its advance into the country, and had met more resistance, than it had expected.\n\nThe Pentagon has noted that the Kremlin still wants its troops to capture Kyiv, despite the stiff Ukrainian resistance.\n\n\u201cWe have every indication that they still want to take Kyiv, that they are advancing on the ground and trying to get closer,\u201d a senior Defense official told CNBC on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to share new details from the Pentagon\u2019s assessment.\n\nSeparately, analysts at Teneo Intelligence concluded on Monday that \u201cthe Kremlin appears to be committed to eliminate Ukraine\u2019s political leadership, while the movement of Russian military forces suggests preparations for new, likely heavier, military action against the capital Kyiv and other key cities in the coming days.\u201d\n\nPeace talks were held between Russian and Ukrainian delegates on Monday, in neighboring Belarus, and although no breakthrough was reached, there are hopes that talks will continue in the coming days.\n\nFor its part, Ukraine has vowed that it will not surrender to Russia and has demanded an immediate cease-fire and that Russian forces leave its territory.\n\n\u201cUkraine is ready to continue seeking a diplomatic solution, but Ukraine is not ready to surrender or capitulate,\u201d Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CNBC\u2019s Hadley Gamble on Monday.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had already struck a pessimistic tone over the outcome of talks, and Kuleba told CNBC he did not know whether the talks would be successful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a diplomat, I have to believe in the success of talks, but at the same time my main goal as a diplomat now is to impose more sanctions on Russia, to bring more weapons to Ukraine and to isolate Russia as much as we can in the international arena so I\u2019m focused on this part of diplomacy,\u201d Kuleba said\n\n\u201cWe stand not only for ourselves but for the world order as we all know it.\u201d\n\nThe foreign minister said that \u201cevery 24 hours are crucial, because Russia deploys more and more military might on Ukraine, hundreds of tanks moving into the country, they dominate the skies with their bombers, rockets, missiles are being thrown on our peaceful cities, civilians being killed, but we continue fighting.\u201d\n\nHe said the war had turned into a \u201creal people\u2019s war against Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nRussia has already conducted attacks both on the ground and by air, with major cities reporting shelling and damage to buildings. Both sides have said that some of their soldiers have been killed, and Ukraine has reported that several hundred of its citizens have died during Russian attacks, including a number of children.\n\nThe invasion has led to a huge number of Ukrainians attempting to flee the country for safety in Eastern Europe, although many have also stayed to defend their homes and nation",

The implication of this is that many polling units in the state may be poorly populated or not populated at all.\u201d\n\nHe further warned that INEC would not conduct elections in polling units where voters had no registration, while appealing to the general public to intensify mobilisation and sensitisation for eligible voters to register or transfer to the newly-created polling units in the state",

          "text": "Residents of Ungwan Romi, Abuja Road junction of Chikun local government area of Kaduna State were subjected to panic and apprehension on Sunday evening and Monday morning following a discovery of an object suspected to be an Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) planted in the area.\n\nThe Kaduna popular beer parlour near Nnamdi Azikiwe bypassed by Abuja highway always witnesses football fans and fun seekers.\n\nIt was reliably gathered that at the time the suspected object was sighted, several football fans were watching the final match between Liverpool and Chelsea football in the beer parlour.\n\nAn eyewitness identified as Mr Bayo told journalists that when the owner of the beer parlour sighted the suspected object on Sunday evening, he moved it to a nearby motor mechanic workshop not knowing what the content was.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, disturbed by the way the object was thrown into the mechanic workshop, the security man attached to the workshop moved the object farther away to the back of the workshop.\n\nThe following day being Monday, the owner of the beer parlour, Mr. Larry Nuhu called the attention of the police who came with bomb detecting experts and neutralised the object and moved it away to their office.\n\nThe eyewitness added, \u201cI saw the object wrapped in a black bag with a battery connected to it, the kind of battery motorcycle uses. But this morning being Monday, the Kaduna State Commissioner of police came with some of his men who are bomb experts and removed the object.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan on Monday evening paid an assessment visit to the scene of the averted incident.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAruwan who arrived at the scene in company of the Garrison Commander advised the owner of the beer parlour to scale up personal security in the area just as he said the State government would continue to beef up security in the State.\n\nSpeaking with Journalists about the incident, the proprietor of the beer parlour, Mr. Larry Nuhu explained that, \u201cWhat happened yesterday (Sunday evening) at 9.30 or there about was that one of my staff rushed to call me and told me that one man came with a bag and suddenly he dropped the bag in the beer parlour and left. It was a black bag and it was opened and I peeped inside and I saw cables there, negative and positive. Thank God I have knowledge of science. So I noticed that it must be something dangerous, though positive and negative were not connected.\n\n\u201cAnother thought came into me to move the object from where customers were staying because it might be timed to cause serious damage. But I decided to move it away so that the damage could be minimal if it is timed.\n\nI took the risk and threw the bag far from the scene. So this morning I called the JTF who in turn invited the police.\n\n\u201cThe bomb experts came and identified it, it was a bomb. They combed the area and told me it was now safe. The Commissioner of Police later came and gave me the advice to beef up local security in the area. He also advised that we should not allow anybody with a bag to enter the place.\n\n\u201cI can estimate that over 70 to 80 people were watching the football match. This is because people were already leaving because the match had come to an end. So some people had earlier left the place.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, Kaduna State Police command has confirmed an explosion, suspected to be an Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) which occurred on Sunday night in Kabala West area of Kaduna South Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) ASP Muhammad Jalige confirmed the incident to the Journalists on Monday in Kaduna.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe explosion is suspected to be IED, there is no casualty recorded in the incident. There was nobody in the building when it exploded. It happened Sunday night around 21: 45pm.\n\n\u201cThe anti-bomb squad has been deployed to the scene to analyse the particles we got from the place,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nASP Jalige said details of the explosion are being investigated and will make the findings available to newsmen as soon as it is completed, he urged residents of the area to remain calm.",

          "title": "Students Stage Nationwide Protest, Seek End To Federal Govt, ASUU Dispute",
          "text": "Piqued over the frequent shutdown of school activities due to incessant strikes, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) yesterday staged a nationwide protest, calling for immediate negotiations to end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Union Universities (ASUU).\n\nIn Abuja, the angry students, who barricaded the entrance of the Federal Ministry of Education, carried placards with various inscriptions urging the federal government to listen to the cries of the students and reach agreement with the lecturers\u2019 union.\n\nASUU embarked on a one-month warning strike on February 14, 2022 over what it viewed as government\u2019s unfaithfulness towards the implementation of the Memorandum of Action it signed with the union.\n\nSome of ASUU\u2019s demands include: adequate funding for the revitalisation of public universities, payment of earned academic allowances, adoption of Universities Transparency Accountability Solutions (UTAS) to solve the inconsistencies associated with the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS), payment of promotion arrears, and the renegotiation of 2009 ASUU/FG agreement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd with the union and federal government set to meet tomorrow, the students have vowed to continue the protest until the strike is called off.\n\nSpeaking during the protest, NANS national president, Comrade Sunday Asefon, pointed out the country\u2019s leaders had enjoyed free, quality education in the past but now want to punish the current generation with endless disruptions in the sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is disheartening to note that the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) has gone on strike more than four years cumulatively since 1999. The consequences of this development are grave on the part of the students who are the victims of these incessant industrial actions embarked upon by ASUU as a result of labour disagreement with the federal government. The resultant effect of these incessant strikes is inconsistency in scholarship, research, and learning output.\n\n\u201cAt the end of every strike, ASUU members get their salary, government officials and politicians get their pay, ministers in charge of the Ministry of Education and his counterpart in the Ministry of Labour get their pay and allowances for unproductive meetings with ASUU, but the students get nothing but the inability to get mobilised for NYSC as a result of age limitation, limited job opportunities as a result of age limitation, and the untimely death of students traversing the poor Nigerian roads unnecessarily all as a result of incessant ASUU strikes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is more worrisome that most of the industrial actions could have been avoided if the government has been responsible enough to fulfil promises/agreements freely entered with ASUU over the years and fulfil their part of the bargain. Public tertiary institution in Nigeria has taken a downward slope in recent years and there is an urgent need to fix the system. Many students no longer trust the education outcome of our tertiary institutions as a result of the incessant strikes and infrastructural neglect from the government.\u201d\n\nAccording to Comrade Asefon, it is these developments that has caused the high level of migration of Nigerian students abroad in search of stable and quality education.\n\n\u201cMany of our students are currently trapped in war-ravaged Ukraine as a result of the incessant strikes in our universities and the lack of adequate infrastructural development,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said the students are, therefore, compelled to take the following positions: \u201cThat the federal government must as a matter of urgency honour every agreement freely entered with ASUU and renegotiate areas that need renegotiation in good faith with ASUU while we call on ASUU to be open-minded, progressive, and be realistic in their terms.\n\nASUU Strike: Education Minister Walks Out Of Meeting With Students\n\n\u201cFederal government must do all it takes to convince ASUU to suspend its strike and return to the classroom immediately to ensure continuity in our academic calendar.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that due to the protest, which cut across the 36 states of the federation, the minister of education, Malam Adamu Adamu, angrily walked out of a meeting with the Nigerian students who were protesting the ASUU strike.\n\nThe minister had scheduled an impromptu meeting with the leadership of NANS as students barricaded the entrance of the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nThe students asked the minister to close down his office since he could not resolve the ASUU matter, even as they lamented the failure of government to resolve the issue after several years.\n\nNANS national president, Asefon, lamented that \u201cASUU strike is killing education more and more. This strike has been affecting our lives since 1999 and Nigerian students want to be part of the discussion between federal government and ASUU to find a lasting solution to the matter.\n\n\u201cWe want federal government and ASUU to as a matter of urgency call off this strike while negotiation continues. We want to go back to classes; if not, this will be more than #EndSars protest,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, trouble erupted when, in the course of the meeting, the NANS\u2019 leadership questioned the minister for abandoning the education sector in a mess while sending his children to study abroad.\n\nAdamu who was not happy at the attack on his person said he was disappointed with the comments and stepped out of the conference room.\n\nReactions have since followed the minister\u2019s action which occurred during a brief meeting that had the registrar of Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, and the executive secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, in attendance.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, hundreds of students of Ebonyi State University and other tertiary institutions in the state, under the aegis of NANS, Ebonyi State chapter, yesterday protested against the one-month industrial action embarked by ASUU.\n\nThe students who converged at the Presco campus of the university for the peaceful protest said the protest was to register their displeasure at the ongoing warning strike by the union.\n\nThe students during the protest that lasted for over four hours barricaded the Presco campus section of the ever-busy Abakaliki-Enugu Road, thereby causing both vehicular and human traffic congestion along the major highway.\n\nThe students insisted that the protest would continue until the union calls off the industrial action and return to classes.\n\nThe students, led by the acting deputy coordinator of Zone F, Comrade Ewa Chukwumaijem, and the Joint Campus Committee (JJC) chairman-elect in the state, Comrade Ituma Kelvin, carried placards with inscriptions like: \u201cage is irreversible, house rents are non-refundable, stop disrupting our life\u2019s plans, FG, \u201cstop delaying our career, stop toying with our future and that of our dear nation\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t continue to be bait for anybody,\u201d among others.\n\nAddressing newsmen, Comrade Chukwumaijem noted that the strikes had always been about the selfish interests of ASUU and never about the interest of the students.\n\nHe called on the federal government and ASUU to take immediate actions towards resolving the strike in the interest of students.\n\nIn Cross River State, the students in Calabar led a peaceful protest to the Governor\u2019s office, urging the federal government to put an end to the strike embarked upon by ASUU.\n\nThe protesting students gathered at the gate of the government house in Calabar carrying placards with different inscriptions such as \u201cPut an end to strike now\u201d, \u201cput your children in public schools and not send them to Ukraine and Russia \u201c, \u201cGet our state library revived now.\u201d\n\nThe protesting students, who were led by their leader, Anthony Efa, said they were unfortunate to find themselves in a nation with no value for education.\n\nAccording to him, it is unfair for a student to be admitted into one of the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions for a four-year course only to end up staying six years due to incessant strikes.\n\nIn Kano State, NANS members converged on Kofar Nassarawa bridge in Kano City to express their concern over the strike, describing it as very unfortunate.\n\nThey carried placards with different inscriptions calling on the federal government and ASUU to bring a lasting solution to the strike. They sang solidarity songs against ASUU and the federal government.\n\nSpeaking at the Ministry of Higher Education, the leader of the protesters, Yazid Tanko Mohammed, explained that the students were conducting the peaceful protest to convey their grievances on the ongoing strike by university lecturers, saying the strike was causing a great setback to their education.\n\nIn her response, the commissioner for Higher Education, Dr . Mariya Bunkure, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Alhaji Dahiru Adda\u2019u, said the Ministry would convey their grievances to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje for onward submission to the federal level.\n\nIn Adamawa State, a road accident resulted in the death of three persons close to the venue of the students\u2019 protest. The accident involved a trailer load of cattle and a motorcycle in Vinikilang Girei local government area of Adamawa State.\n\nThe accident happened a few metres to River Benue bridge. An eye witness said the truck was on a high speed from the Mubi axis and rammed into the motorcycle, killing them and a passer-by.\n\nOfficials of Federal Road Safety Corps were seen evacuating the corpses to Specialist Hospital Yola, and also controlling traffic on the busy Girei-Yola Road.\n\nThe road mishap occurred at the same spot students from various tertiary institutions across the state had assembled to protest the ASUU strike, during which they barricaded the river Benue bridge linking state capital and other parts of the state.\n\nThe students, under the aegis of NAN, said the protest was in line with the directives issued by the national president of the union.\n\nComrade Anasam Maspalma, chairman, NANS Joint Campus Committee (JCC), Adamawa axis, said the decision for the action was taken at the concluded non-elective Congress held in Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cThe protest is our fundamental right to show our dissatisfaction against the actions of ASUU/FG that led to the closure of our universities.\n\n\u201cStudents are tired of the strike; we are saying enough is enough to ASUU/FG strike. As it is, graduating students cannot mobilise for the National Youth Service Corps for service to the fatherland. We want to go back to school and continue with our studies,\u201d Maspalma added.\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has said it will not back down on the current industrial action, accusing the federal government of not keeping to its promises.\n\nPresident of the union, Emmanuel Osodeke, said yesterday that it is now more than two weeks since ASUU declared a one-month warning strike over the federal government\u2019s inability to honour its agreement with the body.\n\n\u201cFor the past nine years or so, they have been giving us promises but once the strike is over, they relapse,\u201d he said ahead of today\u2019s meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige.\n\n\u201cSo, our colleagues are tired of these promises which they don\u2019t fulfil. What we want is actions,\u201d the ASUU leader said in a televised interview via Channels Television breakfast show, Sunrise Daily.\n\nNANS yesterday staged a protest in Ibadan , Oyo State , saying they will resist any attempt by the federal government and ASUU to send them into the streets.\n\nThe students advised both the federal government and ASUU to resolve their crisis over the ongoing strike of the union for the sake of the students.\n\nSpeaking at a protest that took them to Iyaganku press centre of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Oyo State chapter, the Southwest coordinator of NANS, Tegbe Steven Fiyinfoluwa vowed the students will block all the federal roads today if the federal government and ASUU fail to reach an agreement.\n\nSome of the placards displayed during the protest by the students read: \u201cFG and ASUU, stop the madness, stop the strike and revitalise our education\u201d, After the end of strike, only students lose. FG should learn to respect agreement.\u201d",

          "text": "The family has confirmed the death of Emmanuel Sunny Ojeagbase, founder and executive chairman of Complete Communications Limited, publishers of Complete Sports newspapers.\n\nMr Ojeagbase, who is also the publisher of Success Digest and other online publications, died on Saturday, February 22, 2022, in Atlanta, United States of America (USA), after a brief illness, according to a statement released on Monday.\n\nHe was 71 years old at the time.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the family, the late Ojeagbase was from Uzebba, Iuleha in Edo State\u2019s Owan West. Before adding Emmanuel to his name, he was known as Sunny Ojeagbase (or simply \u201cS.O.\u201d).\n\nWhen he founded Sports Souvenir weekly newspaper in 1984, the late media mogul cemented his place in Nigerian history as the country\u2019s first publisher of sports news.\n\nHe was previously a retired Nigerian Army soldier who began his career in sports writing as a stringer for the Daily Times newspapers in the mid-1970s.\n\nMr. Ojeagbase rose fast through sheer talent, tenacity, and hard work, and was appointed sports editor of the Sunday Concord newspapers in 1980, and the sports editor of The Guardian newspapers in 1983. In 1984, he left The Guardian to pursue his dream of becoming an entrepreneur.\n\nMr Ojeagbase launched numerous more pioneering sports titles into the Nigerian sports industry between 1984 and 1994, including Complete Football magazine, Complete Football International (CFI), and International Soccer Review (ISR). Surprisingly, the Complete Football titles were instrumental in assuring Nigeria\u2019s first entry at the FIFA World Cup in the United States in 1994, as well as the country\u2019s gold medal win in football at the Atlanta \u201996 Olympic Games in the United States. In 1995, Mr. Ojeagbase launched Complete Sports as Nigeria\u2019s No. 1 daily sports publication, sandwiched between those two monumental occurrences in Nigerian sports.\n\nIn 1994, Mr. Ojeagbase co-founded the Success Attitude Development Centre (SADC) with his wife, Esther Ojeagbase, with the aim and mission of teaching young Nigerian entrepreneurs how to start, run, and succeed in their businesses. SADC has gone on to develop and inspire thousands of successful entrepreneurs, many of whom are now labor employers, who are Ojeagbase\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n\nMr. Ojeagbase was ordained as a pastor in March 2003, and he preached the gospel of God to everyone who came into contact with him, both in words and acts. His mantra was to do business and live life with the fear of God, integrity, compassion and peace of mind. He was a totally self-made man who was passionate about acquiring knowledge as attested to by a huge library filled with books on business management, leadership, entrepreneurship and related fields. He had a Diploma in Journalism from the University of Lagos, but he was conferred with an honorary Doctorate degree by a different institution for his accomplishments as an entrepreneur. He also received tons of awards and recognitions for his contributions to sports journalism, publishing, business mentorship and entrepreneurship.\n\nMr Ojeagbase was a rallying point for members of his immediate and extended families and also a benefactor to thousands of people. He created and facilitated breakthrough opportunities and jobs for young journalists and contemporaries alike. His generosity and philanthropy was limitless. He was completely detribalised and, despite being a Pastor, was extremely tolerant and unbiased to people of other faiths. He was a good man at heart and a great man in achievements.\n\nMr Sunny Emmanuel Ojeagbase is survived by his wife, Mrs Ojeagbase, his children both biological and adopted, as well as grandchildren and other relatives. He will also be sorely missed by friends, mentees and business associates.\n\nCondolence registers have been opened at Complete Sports headquarters at Plot 9, Alhaji Adenekan Street, Okota, Lagos; and at SADC headquarters, No. 36, Esuola Street, Off Ago Palace Way, Okota, Lagos.\n\nBurial arrangements will be announced by the family.",

Hungary and Romania approved visa-free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor now, movements to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County, and Maramures borders is advised, as they have approved visa free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine,\u201d a statement by Gabriel Aduda, permanent secretary of the Foreign Affairs ministry, read.\n\nMinister assures\n\n\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, the minister, Mr Onyeama, assured of safe returns of Nigerians in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nHe said his ministry had arranged with the management of an indigenous airline- Air Peace \u2013 to evacuate Nigerians who have crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border Wednesday March 2, 2002.\n\n\n\nSpeaker had invited Onyeama, with a view to assessing government preparedness and response mechanism being put in place in response to the crisis in Ukraine, especially as it affects Nigerians in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, the minister said there was a high level engagement of the Nigerian government with the Nigerian Ambassador to Ukraine on the matter, with evacuation expected to commence Wednesday, adding that there were 5,600 Nigerian students and about 8,000 other Nigerian citizens living in the troubled nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stating that some Nigerians had successfully crossed borders to Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring countries, the minister said he had gotten approval of President Muhammadu Buhari to evacuate the stranded citizens, even as he stressed that some of them were however, not willing to leave the country.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, Speaker Gbajabiamila noted that the House was deeply worried over the crisis, and its escalation, urging speedy evacuation of stranded Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHe said many Nigerians did not believe Russia would invade Ukraine until the crisis erupted.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila said the House was ready to approve any supplementary budget the executive may send to the parliament if need be, to cater for such emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe lawmaker further called for a closer working relationship between the ministry\u2019s officials and the House to ensure safety of Nigerians living abroad.\n\n\n\nAngry parents\n\nMeanwhile, scores of parents whose children are currently trapped in Ukraine Monday besieged the Russian Embassy in Abuja to demand the safety of their wards and immediate evacuation efforts by the Nigerian Government.\n\n\n\nThe Concerned Parents, led by Barrister Ada Njoku, urged the Russian Government to ensure they do all within their powers to bring their children back home alive.\n\n\n\nShe lauded the federal government\u2019s efforts at making necessary arrangements to evacuate some of the stranded Nigerians to Poland.\n\nNigerian government had listed four borders in Ukraine where its citizens seeking to leave the country can be evacuated.\n\n\n\nThe parents wondered why it has suddenly become a crime for Nigerians to migrate abroad in search of better and greener pastures.\n\n\n\nAnother visibly angry parent, Blessing David, said her daughter had been in Ukraine for more than five years for studies and that she never knew a time would come that she would be highly apprehensive about her safety.\n\n\n\nShe urged the federal government to urgently come to their aid as any form of delay might be disastrous.\n\n\n\nDavid called for urgent prayers and solidarity for their safe evacuation.\n\n\u201dThe Minister of Foreign Affairs should treat this matter as an emergency, while our citizens should stay calm, comply with safety procedures and avoid self-help in order to avoid the mischief of human traffickers,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nNigerian Immigration\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) has said Nigerians with expired or invalid passports in Ukraine would be allowed back home.\n\n\n\nActing Comptroller-General of Immigration Isah Jere disclosed this Sunday to Premium Times in a telephone interview.\n\n\n\nJere said the government had approved the entry of Nigerians without passports.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigerians in Ukraine without passports are free to travel back to Nigeria. We have spoken to the airlines and other operators to allow them. It is not their fault,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring COVID-19 we could not travel and the passports were fixed to expire on a certain date so we cannot stop it. Each passing day, it draws closer to its expiration date.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Minister has approved that any Nigerian whether studying there or not can return, they will renew it here,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nNegotiation continues as war rages\n\nIn a related development, delegations from Kyiv and Moscow have begun talks at the Ukraine-Belarus border, the foreign ministries of both countries have confirmed.\n\n\n\nUkraine said its goal for the talks is an \u201cimmediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops\u201d from Ukrainian territory.\n\nAl Jazeera reports that Kyiv has sent a delegation of several high-ranking officials, but the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is not joining the discussion.\n\n\n\nRussian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Russia wants to reach an agreement that is in the interest of both sides.\n\n\n\nThe negotiation comes five days after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said it is the biggest attack on a European state since the Second World War.\n\n\n\nBy Monday afternoon, Ukrainian soldiers were still trying to resist Russia\u2019s advances.\n\n\n\nIn the face of stiff resistance and devastating sanctions, Putin set Russia\u2019s nuclear forces on high alert, threatening to elevate the war to a terrifying new level.\n\n\n\nRussia has made some military gains in southern Ukraine, experts told Finacial Times, but \u201cthe pace of its advance has slowed and it is yet to take any big Ukrainian population centres, with the capital Kyiv still under government control.\u201d\n\n\n\nZelensky said Monday that Ukraine was braced for a crucial 24 hours, as Russian troops stepped up efforts to encircle the capital.\n\nThe bulk of Putin\u2019s ground forces remained more than 30km north of Kyiv, according to an assessment by the UK defence ministry, their advance frustrated by logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance.\n\n\n\nReinforcements were expected Monday to buttress what appears to be Russia\u2019s objective of taking Kyiv to force a surrender, the Financial Times reports.\n\nHeavy fighting continued around Kharkiv, although media reports suggested that the second largest city remained in government hands.\n\n\n\nIn southern Ukraine, Russian attempts to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea appeared to be having more success.\n\n\n\nIts forces have captured the towns of Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov, and Enerhodar, according to a Russian defence ministry statement seen by Financial Times.\n\n\n\n\u201cReports suggested that the port of Mariupol, the last big stronghold of Ukrainian resistance that has stopped Russia from connecting the eastern border region of Donbas to Crimea, was surrounded.\u201d\n\n\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry added that its troops had seized territory around a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhiya and that Russia now controlled all of the Ukrainian airspaces.\n\n\n\nUkraine\u2019s military confirmed Russian troops continued to attack airports, air defence systems, critical infrastructure and residential areas around the country and had launched missile strikes on buildings in the cities of Zhytomyr and Chernihiv.\n\n\n\nThe exact death tolls are unclear as of Monday, but the United Nations (UN) has said 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded. The UN however said the figure is likely a vast undercount.\n\n\n\nMore than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine while about 3 million require humanitarian aid, according to the UN.\n\n\n\nUS asks Americans in Russia to leave \u2018immediately\u2019\n\nAlso, the United States recommended Monday that Americans in Russia leave immediately following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\u201cUS citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available,\u201d said the State Department, which had previously urged US citizens not to travel to Russia.\n\n\n\nThe department warned that options for getting out of Russia are dwindling quickly as international sanctions bite, including many countries having closed their airspace to Russian carriers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe US government\u2019s ability to provide routine or emergency services to US citizens in Russia is severely limited,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nIt warned of \u201cpotential for harassment against US citizens by Russian government security officials.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe latest guidance came after the department\u2019s announcement earlier in the day that non-emergency staff and their families at the US Embassy in Moscow are now authorized to leave the country. AFP\n\n\n\nDozens killed in Kharkiv attack\n\n\u201cKharkiv has just been massively fired upon by grads [rockets]. Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded,\u201d the interior ministry said on Facebook.\n\n\n\nThe attack came on the fifth day of the Russian invasion as negotiators from both sides held talks in Belarus.\n\n\n\nRussia is attacking Ukraine on several fronts but its advance has been slowed by Ukrainian resistance.\n\n\n\nVideos shared on social media showed rockets landing in Kharkiv, in what some defence analysts described as typical of a cluster munition strike on a dense urban area.\n\n\n\nRussia has previously denied targeting residential areas.\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv, the bulk of Russian forces are about 30km (19 miles) outside the north of the city, slowed by fierce Ukrainian resistance, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.\n\n\n\nBut street-level fighting continues in several parts of the city.\n\nDespite the danger, a two-day curfew has been lifted, with residents emerging from underground shelters to buy food and gather supplies.\n\n\n\nAnother video circulating on social media showed huge clouds of smoke at a burning shopping centre in Chernihiv, another city that has been under pressure from the Russian offensive.\n\n\n\nHappy to stay alive\n\nKasenya, who spent more than 36 hours underground, told the BBC she had managed to get home. \u201cI can\u2019t describe how I am feeling, I\u2019m happy to stay alive and safe and just have the possibility to see my splendid and beautiful Kyiv,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the northern border with Belarus, Ukrainian and Russian officials have ended their first round of talks.\n\n\n\nHopes for a breakthrough are slim, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was a \u201csmall chance to end the war\u201d.\n\n\n\nA Ukrainian official said both sides would now return to their respective capitals for further consultations before a second round of negotiations.\n\n\n\nThe UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said millions of civilians were being forced to huddle in makeshift bomb shelters such as underground rail stations to escape explosions.\n\n\n\nSince the invasion began on Thursday, her office has recorded 102 civilian deaths, including seven children \u2013 and more than 300 injured.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real figures are, I fear, considerably higher,\u201d she said.\n\nTo the north and north-east, Kharkiv and Chernihiv were shelled by Russian forces overnight but remain in Ukraine\u2019s control. Shells landed near a shopping centre in Kharkiv during the day, while fighting continued in the streets.\n\n\n\nTo the south, Russian forces are trying to take control of the key strategic port of Mariupol, near Russia-annexed Crimea. Ukraine denied reports that Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, had fallen into Russia hands.\n\n\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International also accused Russia of indiscriminate use of weaponry on populated areas, something it said could constitute a war crime.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Lithuania\u2019s government said it would ask prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to investigate \u201cwar crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d in Ukraine",

          "text": "Seven years after, the Presidency Monday alleged President Goodluck Jonathan administration worked assiduously to bend the electoral system in its bid to scuttle Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s victory during the 2015 presidential election.\n\nThe Presidency\u2019s position was contained in a statement signed by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu and titled, \u201cAssent into law of the electoral act 2022: Landmark moment for the nation.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency argued that Jonathan\u2019s government tried everything within its power to leverage its 16-year incumbency in thwarting the outcome of the election despite the margin of the overwhelming vote polled by Buhari during the election.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cIt is easy to forget that the election of 2015 was the first time in the history of Nigeria that power peacefully changed hands at the ballot box. It was the first time any party or candidate not from the incumbent PDP had won a nationwide contest since the re-establishment of democracy.\n\n\u201cThis came despite the then administration pulling every lever of its sixteen-year incumbency to bend the electoral system to its advantage.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s re-election by a 15 per cent and a 4 million vote margin in 2019 was therefore equally decisive: it was the first time a non-PDP administration had even been returned to office to a consecutive term.\n\n\u201cThe last two contests represent the levelling of the political playing-field between long-time incumbents and long-time opposition by sheer force of citizens\u2019 determination for change. Nigerians voted so decisively for the President and the APC, and the margins so significant that the result could not be in doubt.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency, however, admitted that despite the victory, it was not a reason to ignore the fact there have been inadequacies in electoral law \u2013 and therefore electoral practice.\n\nThe evident inadequacies, the Presidency said, spurred the president to assent the Electoral Act 2022 after the back and forth on some controversial provisions of the bill.\n\nThe statement further added that the assent underscores the perfect workings of a parliament and executive both driven by new energy to deliver change in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis of course runs parallel to that which we witnessed in the past when self-interest overrode the nation and the fashioning of electoral acts.\n\n\u201cMore than anything else, this law underscores the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring free and fair elections, dignity of the citizens, opportunity, and justice to all political participants whether they are voters or candidates.\n\n\u201cThis law furthers social empowerment and inclusion by limiting the influence of money on elections and raw power of incumbents to use to the disadvantage of opponents outside the political tent.\n\n\u201cIt equally limits the thuggish practice of kingpins who scare voters and officials away, snatch ballot boxes to fill desired outcomes against the popular wish,\u201d the Presidency said.\n\nPDP fires back\n\nReplying the Presidency, the PDP said the Buhari administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was drowning and looking for anything to hang on to survive.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba stated this in an exclusive interview with Blueprint in Abuja Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat happened since they were elected in 2015 that they couldn\u2019t come up with a new Electoral Act? In any event, APC never wanted a new Electoral Act and that is why President Muhammadu Buhari his asking for amendment of section 84 (12) to cover up and allow people in government to steal government fund and use it for election,\u201d Ologunagba claimed.\n\nThe opposition further said: \u201cWe know there was an amendment in 2010 under a PDP-led Federal Government. But again, no law is perfect, it is dynamic with circumstance. If it was not done in 2015, what happened in 2018? Why was it refused severally?\n\n\u201cThe amendment that took place is not because the APC or the President was interested. It was the members of the civil society organisations, opposition parties and other stakeholders\u2019 pressure that made them do it\u201d.\n\nIPAC lauds Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has called on lawmakers to initiate the process of expunging the contentious clause 84 (12).\n\nAt a press briefing Monday in Abuja, IPAC National Chairman Engr. Yabagi Yusuf, insisted that Clause 84 (12) was contrary to the provisions of Sections 40 and 42 of the Constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe share the views of the President on the Clause which makes it mandatory for political appointees to resign from their positions before participating as delegates at political party congresses and conventions or, as aspirants to elective offices.\n\n\u201cTo us in IPAC, this Clause runs contrary to the provisions of Sections 40 and 42 of the Constitution on the inalienable fundamental rights of every eligible citizen to participate in the electoral processes.\u201d\n\nIPAC also said expunging the contentious clause would lso be bringing the Act in tune with the Constitution which categorically stipulates that political office holders are only to vacate their positions or appointments, thirty (30) days before the elections.\n\nYabagi who commended President Buhari, said the signing of the amended Electoral Act has recorded a remarkable and epochal milestone in the nation\u2019s history of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe brazen and blatant subversion of the electoral processes has unfortunately, earned Nigeria an opprobrium and ridicule and stigmatisation in the comity of democratic nations of the world,\u201d the body said.\n\n\u201cIn terms of security, which is one of the cardinal responsibilities of government, Nigerians have been experiencing a situation of ever-worsening security of lives and property in the past twenty-two years of democracy.\n\n\u201cTo mention but a few, Boko Haram, the Islamists insurgency in the north-East region, has become a hydra-headed monster since the murderous vampire reared its head in 2009. The plagues of armed banditry, kidnapping and senseless inter-communal wars, especially, in the North-West and North-Central and generally, in the other regions of the country, have since added to the state of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that the gloomy scenario highlighted above could have been positively different if, for instance, the rules and regulations guiding the electoral process had not provided the rooms for manipulation and abuse by elements that are deficient in their democratic credentials, patriotism, vision and commitment to the people\u2019s welfare and development of the nation.\n\n\u201cWith the Electoral Act and its revolutionary provisions and innovations, the silver-linings are appearing the nation\u2019s political and democratic firmaments. It is a transformational departure from an inglorious era to a new dawn in the ways and manner of conducting elections in Nigeria,\u201d Yabagi said.\n\nHe identified highlights of the new Electoral Act that excite the council to include, \u201cthe clause that stipulates that funds for general elections must be released at least, one year before the elections. Section 94 of the Act stipulates early commencement of campaign seasons at least, 150 days to elections, adding that \u201cthis provision has the advantage of giving the political parties and candidates, sufficient time to get to the electorate with their manifestos.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the leadership and members of the 9th National Assembly and INEC, ably led by Professor Mahmud Yakubu, for their uncommon courage, he said, \u201cWith the electronic transmission of election results from the polling units through to the collation centres, we in the IPAC are confident that the practice of distorting figures of votes cast may have become history.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cbarely twenty-four hours after the Presidential assent, INEC swung into action by announcing new dates in its timetable for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cTo us in IPAC, the swiftness shown by INEC is yet another commendable action that has further raised our long-held confidence in the zeal, diligence and commitment of the Commission in the dispensation of its assignment.\u201d\n\nIPAC National Chairman enjoined the other stakeholders to brace up to the pace being set by INEC to enhance the overall success of the 2023 general elections.",

          "text": "Warner Bros. is halting the release of \u201cThe Batman\u201d in Russia, just days before it was to open in theaters there, as Hollywood moved to cease distribution plans in the country following Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWarner Bros., the Walt Disney Co. and Sony Pictures said Monday that they would \u201cpause\u201d the release of their films in Russia. Each studio has significant upcoming releases that had been set to debut internationally in the coming weeks. \u201cThe Batman,\u201d one of the year\u2019s more anticipated films, launches Friday in North America and many overseas territories, including Russia.\n\n\u201cIn light of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, WarnerMedia is pausing the release of its feature film \u2018The Batman\u2019 in Russia,\u201d a spokesperson for the studio said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves. We hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to this tragedy.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 move closely followed a similar decision Monday by the Walt Disney Co. The studio had planned to open the Pixar film \u201cTurning Red\u201d in Russia on March 10. That film is going straight to Disney+ in the U.S. Before Disney\u2019s announcement, Warner Bros. had been expected to proceed with the Russian release of \u201cThe Batman.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, including the upcoming \u2018Turning Red\u2019 from Pixar,\u201d a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.\u201d\n\nHollywood scramble plans in Russia late Monday, as global pressure mounted to sever business ties with the country over the war in Ukraine. Western economic sanctions sent Russia\u2019s ruble plummeting Monday as numerous nations sought to block Russian banks. On Saturday, the Ukrainian Film Academy called for an international boycott of the Russian film industry.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association said Monday that it \u201cstands with the international community in upholding the rule of law and condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our member companies, who lead the film, TV and streaming industry, we express our strongest support for Ukraine\u2019s vibrant creative community who, like all people, deserve to live and work peacefully,\u201d the MPA said in a statement.\n\nRussia is not a leading market for Hollywood, but the country typically ranks in the top dozen countries globally in box office. Sony\u2019s recent smash hit \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\u201d which has totaled $1.85 billion in ticket sales worldwide, has grossed $46.7 million in Russia. Sony\u2019s most recent chart-topping release, the Tom Holland adventure \u201cUncharted,\u201d has amassed about $20 million in Russia over the last two weeks.\n\nAfter Disney and Warner Bros. made their announcements, Sony followed suit.\n\n\u201cGiven the ongoing military action in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty and humanitarian crisis unfolding in that region, we will be pausing our planned theatrical releases in Russia, including the upcoming release of \u2018Morbius,\u2019\u201d Sony said in a statement referencing the Spider-Man spinoff slated for early April. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted and hope this crisis will be resolved quickly.\u201d",

This action has been in development for several months,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe move comes amid widespread international condemnation of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which since last Thursday has left more than 100 Ukrainian civilians dead and forced half a million others to flee the country, according to the UN.\n\nRussia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters the diplomats had been asked to leave by March 7.\n\nNebenzia then raised the issue at the start of a UN Security Council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing the US move as \u201chostile\u201d and a violation of its commitments as host of the UN headquarters in New York City.\n\nUS Deputy UN Ambassador Richard Mills responded: \u201cThose diplomats that have been asked to leave the United States were engaged in activities that were not in accordance with their responsibilities and obligations as diplomats.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has imposed a slew of sanctions against Russia in response to the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which began last Thursday.\n\nThe US and its allies, including the European Union, last week also announced plans to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov over the country\u2019s attack on its neighbour.\n\nThe number of people fleeing the invasion has surged to more than half a million, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said earlier on Monday, while at least 102 civilians have been killed since Russian troops entered the country.\n\nLong lines of cars and buses were backed up at checkpoints at the borders of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova, as civilians continued to flee Russia\u2019s assault. Others crossed the borders on foot, dragging their possessions.\n\ners \u2013 including 116 children \u2013 have been wounded in the Russian assault.\n\nThe first round of talks aimed at ending the fighting between Moscow and Kyiv concluded on Monday with no immediate agreements.\n\nThe talks were held near the Belarus-Ukraine border as Russian troops continued their attack on Ukrainian cities \u2013 including the second-largest, Kharkiv \u2013 on the fifth day of Russia\u2019s invasion.",

          "text": "A 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and other vehicles threatened Ukraine\u2019s capital Tuesday, the sixth day of the war. But even as Russia intensified shelling of the country\u2019s second-largest city, the Kremlin has found itself increasingly isolated by tough economic sanctions that have sent its currency plummeting.\n\nAfter a first, five-hour session of talks between Ukraine and Russia yielded no stop in the fighting, both sides agreed to another meeting in coming days. Ukraine\u2019s embattled president, however, said he believed the stepped-up shelling was designed to force him into concessions.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cI believe Russia is trying to put pressure (on Ukraine) with this simple method,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday in a video address. He did not offer details of the talks that took place Monday, but he said Kyiv was not prepared to make concessions \u201cwhen one side is hitting another with rocket artillery.\u201d\n\nSix days into the invasion, the Russian military\u2019s movements have been stalled by fierce resistance on the ground and a surprising inability to dominate the airspace. Many Ukrainian civilians, meanwhile, spent another night huddled in shelters, basements or corridors.\n\n\u201cI sit and pray for these negotiations to end successfully, so that they reach an agreement to end the slaughter,\u201d said Alexandra Mikhailova, weeping as she clutched her cat in a shelter in Mariupol. Around her, parents tried to console children and keep them warm.\n\nThe Kremlin has twice in as many days raised the specter of nuclear war and put on high alert an arsenal that includes intercontinental ballistic missiles and long-range bombers. Stepping up his rhetoric, President Vladimir Putin denounced the United States and its allies as an \u201cempire of lies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an embattled Ukraine moved to solidify its ties to the West by applying to join the European Union \u2014 a largely symbolic move for now, but one that won\u2019t sit well with Putin, who has long accused the United States of trying to pull Ukraine out of Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\nA top Putin aide and head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said that during the first talks held between the sides since the invasion, the envoys \u201cfound certain points on which common positions could be foreseen.\u201d He said they agreed to continue the discussions in the days ahead.\n\nAs the talks along the Belarusian border wrapped up, several blasts could be heard in Kyiv, and Russian troops advanced on the city of nearly 3 million. The convoy of armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was 17 miles (25 kilometers) from the center of the city and stretched about 40 miles, according to satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies.\n\nPeople in Kyiv lined up for groceries after the end of a weekend curfew, standing beneath a building with a gaping hole blown in its side. Kyiv remained \u201ca key goal\u201d for the Russians, Zelenskyy said, noting that it was hit by three missile strikes on Monday and that hundreds of saboteurs were roaming the city.\n\n\u201cThey want to break our nationhood, that\u2019s why the capital is constantly under threat,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\nMessages aimed at the advancing Russian soldiers popped up on billboards, bus stops and electronic traffic signs across the capital. Some used profanity to encourage Russians to leave. Others appealed to their humanity.\n\n\u201cRussian soldier \u2014 Stop! Remember your family. Go home with a clean conscience,\u201d one read.\n\nVideo from Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-biggest city, with a population of about 1.5 million, showed residential areas being shelled, with apartment buildings shaken by repeated, powerful blasts.\n\nAuthorities in Kharkiv said at least seven people had been killed and dozens injured. They warned that casualties could be far higher.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to have a blitzkrieg, but it failed, so they act this way,\u201d said 83-year-old Valentin Petrovich, who watched the shelling from his downtown apartment. He gave just his first name and his patronymic, a middle name derived from his father\u2019s name, out of fear for his safety.\n\nThe Russian military has denied targeting residential areas despite abundant evidence of shelling of homes, schools and hospitals.\n\nFighting raged in other towns and cities. The strategic port city of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, is \u201changing on,\u201d said Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovich. An oil depot was reported bombed in the eastern city of Sumy.\n\nRussian artillery hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, and more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed, the head of the region wrote on Telegram. Dmytro Zhyvytskyy posted photographs of the charred shell of a four-story building and rescuers searching rubble.\n\nIn a later Facebook post, he said many Russian soldiers and some local residents also were killed during the fighting on Sunday. The report could not immediately be confirmed.\n\nDespite its superior military strength, Russia still lacked control of Ukrainian airspace. This may help explain how Ukraine has so far prevented a rout.\n\nIn the seaside resort town of Berdyansk, dozens of protesters chanted angrily in the main square against Russian occupiers, yelling at them to go home and singing the Ukrainian national anthem. They described the soldiers as exhausted young conscripts.\n\n\u201cFrightened kids, frightened looks. They want to eat,\u201d Konstantin Maloletka, who runs a small shop, said by telephone. He said the soldiers went into a supermarket and grabbed canned meat, vodka and cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThey ate right in the store,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looked like they haven\u2019t been fed in recent days.\u201d\n\nFor many, Russia\u2019s announcement of a nuclear high alert stirred fears that the West could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had yet to see any appreciable change in Russia\u2019s nuclear posture.\n\nAs far-reaching Western sanctions on Russian banks and other institutions took hold, the ruble plummeted, and Russia\u2019s Central Bank scrambled to shore it up, as did Putin, signing a decree restricting foreign currency.\n\nBut that did little to calm Russian fears. In Moscow, people lined up to withdraw cash as the sanctions threatened to drive up prices and reduce the standard of living for millions of ordinary Russians.\n\nIn yet another blow to Russia\u2019s economy, oil giant Shell said it was pulling out of the country because of the invasion. It announced it will withdraw from its joint ventures with state-owned gas company Gazprom and other entities and end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Europe.\n\nThe economic sanctions, ordered by the U.S. and other allies, were just one contributor to Russia\u2019s growing status as a pariah country.\n\nRussian airliners are banned from European airspace, Russian media is restricted in some countries, and some high-tech products can no longer be exported to the country. On Monday, in a major blow to a soccer-mad nation, Russian teams were suspended from all international soccer.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n\u2014 The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he will open an investigation soon into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.\n\n\u2014 Cyberattacks hit Ukrainian embassies around the world, and Russian media outlets.\n\n\u2014 The United States announced it is expelling 12 members of Russia\u2019s U.N. mission, accusing them of spying.\n\nThe U.N. human rights chief said at least 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded \u2014 warning that figure is probably a vast undercount \u2014 and Ukraine\u2019s president said at least 16 children were among the dead.\n\nMore than a half-million people have fled the country since the invasion, another U.N. official said, many of them going to Poland, Romania and Hungary.\n\nAmong the refugees in Hungary was Maria Pavlushko, 24, an information technology project manager from a city west of Kyiv. She said her father stayed behind to fight the Russians.\n\n\u201cI am proud about him,\u201d she said, adding that many of her friends were planning to fight, too.\n\n___\n\nEditor",
