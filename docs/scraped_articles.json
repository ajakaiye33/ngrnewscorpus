          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013AS Nigeria looks forward to join the rest of the world to mark the 2022 World TB Day,KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation has said the country still accounts for 4.6 percent of the global estimated TB cases.\n\nBesides, the local non-profit organization dedicated to the fight against tuberculosis, said Nigeria has the highest TB burden in Africa, \u201cthe 6\u201d globally and 1 of 10 countries that accounts for 70 percent of the global gap between the estimated global incidence of multidrug-resistant TB each year and the number enrolled on treatment. \u201c\n\nThe Executive Director of KNCV TB Foundation, Dr. Odume Bethrand, who stated this at a pre-World TB Day, in Abuja, Thursday, added that \u201cAbout 75% of TB patients in Nigeria and their households are facing catastrophic costs.\u201d\n\n\u201d Though Nigeria is one of four countries that improved case notification against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can do so much more to close the about 70% gap in TB notification,\u201d he said.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, \u201cTo end TB in Nigeria, we must address the funding gap; invest more inhuman and material resources needed to control the TB epidemic.\u201d\n\nDr. Bethrand insisted that\u201d We must do more by continuing to build the capacity of the front-line health care workers, by\n\nexpanding access to TB diagnostic services \u2014 GeneXpert, Truenat, TB Lamp as well Chest x-ray services by investing more on digital portable x-rays. \u201c\n\nHe also said the country can do more to end the infectious disease by ensuring adequate supplies of drugs and essential commodities, strengthening the health system especially data management and TB surveillance system, and by creating a conducive environment that encourages TB innovations and research.\n\nNoting that, \u201cA week from today, being the 24\u2033 March, will be the World TB day\u201d, he reminded that:\u201d This is an annual event to commemorate the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced his discovery of Mycobactenum tuberculosis, the bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB).\u201d\n\n\u201cWorld TB Day is a day to educate the public about the socio-economic impact of TB and KNCV TB Foundation Nigeria, along with our funding Partner the USAID, the STOP TB Partnership Nigeria, and the Government will use the opportunity to share our successes, create awareness and most importantly highlight the key challenges that hinder our progress toward meeting set targets for TB control in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year\u2019s celebration is: Invest to END TB, Save Lives, and that is why we are choosing to Give more, do more & End TB Now.\n\n\u201d With a funding gap of 69%, and donor dependence for TB control in Nigeria our theme could not be timelier,\u2019 he said.\n\nEarlier,the Acting Board Chairman, Stop TB Partnership Nigeria,Dr. Queen Ogbuji, while speaking, regretted that \u201cEach day, about 4,100 people lose their lives to TB and nearly 30,000 people fall ill with this preventable and curable disease.\u201d\n\nShe explained that:\u201dStop TB Partnership Nigeria in collaboration with the National TB and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP), with support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other stakeholders has been responsible for organizing the Pre-World TB Day Press Conference to inform the media and the public on the activities planned for the World TB Day and to create more awareness and provide update on the TB situation in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll over the world, we commemorate World TB Day on March 24 to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic impact of tuberculosis (TB) and urge acceleration of efforts to end the global TB epidemic. The date marks the day in 1882 when Dr Robert Koch announced that he had discovered the bacterium that causes TB, which opened the way towards diagnosing and curing this disease.\n\nTB remains one of the world\u2019s deadliest infectious killers,\u201d she said.\n\nNoting that,\u201dTB is the leading cause of death of people with HIV and a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 66 million lives since the year 2000,\u201d she said:\u201dHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed years of progress made in the fight to end TB. For the first time in over a decade, TB deaths increased in 2020. This World TB Day is an opportunity to focus on the people affected by this disease and to call for accelerated action to end TB suffering and deaths, especially in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s commemoration,she explained,\u201d Conveys the urgent need to invest resources to ramp up the fight against TB and achieve the commitments to end TB made by global leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201d This is especially critical in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that has put End TB progress at risk, and to ensure equitable access to prevention and care in line with the drive towards achieving Universal Health Coverage. More investment to TB will save millions more lives, and accelerate the end of the TB epidemic,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe Stop TB Partnership and all partners are calling on all those involved in the fight against TB to unite under this overarching theme and sound the alarm that the low levels of funding for the TB response year after year cannot continue nor be accepted anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nDr Ogbuji spoke further:\u201dGlobally, of the US$ 15 billion annual funding for TB promised by world leaders at the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UNHLM on TB in 2018, less than half has been delivered. And in Nigeria, of the $373 million needed for TB control in Nigeria in the year 2020, only 31% was available to all the implementers of TB control activities in Nigeria (7% domestic and 24% donor funds), with 69% funding gap.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on the government at the federal, state and local government levels as well as corporate sector and philanthropists to invest in TB and prevent people from dying from a preventable and curable disease.\u201d",

No ABY 237 JR, was flagged down by operatives on legitimate stop and search duties along with Black Horse Area, New Garage, Off Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode Road.\n\n\u201dThe corps member, however, drove directly towards the officers and knocked down, one Sgt. Agbadahun Bright,\u201d he added.\n\nThe PPRO said that the corps member, in his determination to escape, \u201ddrove off without batting an eyelid and veered off his lane towards the direction of other oncoming vehicles,\u201d till he ran into a tricycle from where the policemen caught up with him.\n\n\u201cOn sighting his returning colleagues from their various Community Development Service groups, he immediately raised a false alarm about being shot at by the Police officers.\n\n\u201dThus, inciting the now riotous corps members to completely cut off the flow of traffic by blocking the road and other adjoining routes, before proceeding to attack any officer in sight.\n\n\u201cAssertively, no shot was fired at the scene by any officer(s) before or after the incident at the corps member or his vehicle, rather the riotous corps members smashed the side mirrors of the officer\u2019s operational vehicle, broke its windscreen and deflated all its tyres.\n\n\u201cThe riotous corps members then pounced on Sgt. Agbadahun Bright and stabbed his right cheek with a sharp object.\n\n\u201cThe officer was immediately rescued by a swift police reinforcement and he is presently receiving medical attention,\u201d Osifeso said.\n\nOsifeso further said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Ngozi Onadeko, had said that officers of the command would remain civil and professional in the discharge of their duties.\n\nHe added: \u201dbut would no longer condone acts of hostility from members of the public.\u201d\n\nOsisefo said that further investigations were ongoing and updates would be provided on the matter in due course.

          "title": "Buhari, Osinbajo and the bigorty question \u2013 Femi Adesina",
          "text": "Have you ever met a religious bigot before? Pray that you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not an interesting experience, irrespective of the faith the bigot professes.\n\nA bigot is obstinately or unreasonably attached to a belief, opinion, and is prejudiced against or antagonistic towards a person or people who don\u2019t share what he believes.\n\nI ask again: have you met a religious bigot before? Pray that you don\u2019t. And if you unfortunately do, don\u2019t argue, don\u2019t remonstrate with such person. Just show a clean pair of heels.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is a man that had been serially de-marketed, flagellated and excoriated as a religious bigot. It was a narrative deliberately concocted and conjured by those who were afraid of the probity and integrity he could bring into public office. They tarred him with the brush of bigotry, which hindered the man from attaining the presidency for a long while.\n\nBut every lie has an expiry date. A time came when the public no longer bought the jejune argument. Pro-Buhari forces fought back vigorously. One of them was eminent virologist, Prof Tam David-West (God rest his soul). He wrote a book with the title \u201816 Sins of Muhammadu Buhari,\u2019 in which he debunked the lies being told against the former military head of state. One of them was the allegation of being a religious bigot.\n\nA larger number of Nigerians got to understand that the bigotry tag was fake, false, an attempt to give the dog a bad name, in order to hang it. Muhammadu Buhari coasted to office as President in 2015, after three earlier trials.\n\nBut there is still a remnant that maintains its entrenched position. And they are the ones who look down on us Christians, for going to \u201cwork with a Fulani Muslim, a jihadist who does not want to see Christians at all.\u201d True? False.\n\nWho else can you trust more than the man (or woman) that cooks or serves your meal? Possibly nobody. Buhari has Christian cooks, male and female.\n\nAnd who can you also trust more than the man that drives you? He can decide to do bad, bad things to you. Buhari has Christian drivers.\n\nI was glad to hear Vice President Yemi Osinbajo touch on the matter early this week. While receiving Senegal-based Grand Khalifa of Tijaniya Movement Worldwide, Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Niass, he said in seven years of working with President Buhari, he has not had any issues with him, particularly in the area of religion.\n\nSaid the Vice President: \u201cPresident Buhari is a serious Muslim, and I am a pastor. Both of us have worked together for about 7 years, we have not had any issues. The President has shown great leadership, he has shown that he wants a country where people of different faiths live in harmony and with love for one another.\u201d\n\nWell-spoken, well-proven. And I have stories to tell to buttress what VP Osinbajo has said.\n\nJust two weeks ago, someone who was in the inner caucus when President Buhari was putting together his team in 2015, told me a story. It went this way:\n\n\u201cWhen the President likes you, he just likes you. I remember in 2015 when they brought three names to him as possible media advisers. They were made of Christians and Muslims. He just brought out his pen and marked your name. That was all.\u201d\n\nA media adviser is in the inner caucus. You can see your boss whenever you want to, and that was what the President told me the very day I resumed: \u201cAdesina, ensure that nobody keeps you away from me. Whenever you want to see me, just come.\u201d\n\nBigot? He won\u2019t give such position or latitude to a person of a different faith.\n\nEarly in the first term, one of my spiritual fathers passed on. Rev Cornelius Obasi had taken a keen interest in me as a young man growing up in the Foursquare Gospel Church in Lagos. That was in the 1980s.\n\nHe was the Assistant Pastor of the branch I attended in the Omole area. The main pastor was Rev Felix Meduoye, who later went on to become General Overseer of the Church for many years.\n\nI had completed National Service, was working as a Current Affairs Officer in Radio Lagos. But I never joked with church services, and soon became a teacher in the Sunday School.\n\nOne day, after service, Rev Obasi called me. \u201cBrother Femi, you speak good English. Who are you really?\u201d I told him about myself and thus began a lifelong friendship.\n\nWhen he passed on (was it late 2015 or 2016?), a two days funeral was being organized. And I wanted to attend, to pay my last respects. So I went to meet the President.\n\nI asked him for two days off and told him why I needed it. A religious bigot would never hear of such. But not President Buhari. He told me: \u201cI am happy that you\u2019ve decided to go and give last honors to such a man. Please go. We will be here till you return.\u201d And that winsome smile.\n\nWhen I returned to Abuja, I went to see him again, to say I was back. He welcomed me and said something I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\u201cAdesina (he prefers to call me by my surname), I want to thank you for going to honour a man who contributed to bringing you up spiritually. God will give you lada for it.\u201d\n\nI thanked him and left. But lada, what does it mean?\n\nI sought out my friend, Garba Deen Mohammed, now NNPC spokesman. What does Lada mean? I told him the story. He laughed and explained that lada means to reward or wages. He said the President was praying that God will reward me for attending the burial of Rev Cornelius Obasi.\n\nA bigot? I hear.\n\nOur first Christmas in government. December 2015. I wanted to spend the season in Lagos. And I asked him for permission. By all means, he answered. \u201cI know the Vice President, yourself, and some others are church people. Please go. Spend Christmas and New Year with your families. When you now come back, me too I\u2019ll go for a few days.\u201d And he laughed. Bigot? They never want to hear of Christmas. Since 2015, he would give all Christians working with him time off every Easter and Christmas. I like that kind of \u2018bigotry.\u2019\n\nWhen the Foursquare Gospel Church turned 60 years in Nigeria. I told the President, and he gladly agreed to meet with the leadership. He did. Bigot? Please tell me another story.\n\nThe Vice President survived a helicopter crash in 2019. The President publicly rejoiced with him, and then at the next Federal Executive Council meeting, he congratulated the VP again. Jocularly, he said: \u201cI can imagine that when the chopper crashed with a bang, VP as a pastor must have shouted, Jesus!Jesus! Jesus! And fortunately, Jesus was not far away, so He saved him.\u201d\n\nWe all laughed. But one instructive lesson. Bigots don\u2019t like Jesus. They never want to hear His name or attribute anything miraculous to Him. Buhari, a bigot? I beg, comot for road, make I pass.\n\nIt is said that as a military commander, he gave an opportunity for Muslim soldiers to observe the Jumat on Fridays, and Christian soldiers were allowed to go to church on Sundays. A bigot would allow Muslims and pretend that Christians didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAs the administration winds down (in 14 months) I pray for the grace to be able to document my experiences with this President. People would then realize how unfair they\u2019ve been to him. A man more sinned against, rather than sinning.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

Governor Bello acted for him while he was away.\n\nBuni, also declared all the activities of the acting chairman as valid and binding on the party.\n\nHe has also initiated rapprochement with all the governors who worked against him while on medical trip.\n\nThere were indications that Buni and the governors may collectively review the convention committees and agree on a harmonised list.\n\nAccording to a source, Buni returned to Abuja at about 4am yesterday.\n\nThe source said: \u201cIn line with the script given to him by the President, Buni was already reaching out to other colleague governors on how to keep APC united to make the March 26 convention a reality.\n\n\u201cEarly in the day, he had a meeting with some governors, including Babagana Zulum (Borno); Yahaya Bello (Kogi); Gboyega Oyetola (Osun); Hope Uzodimma (Imo); Yahaya Bello (Kogi) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun).\n\n\u201cAt about 5pm, he held another meeting with the acting chairman and members of the CECPC where he told them that he had no malice against anyone.\n\n\u201cIn the next few hours, he will have audience with those who moved against him.

His Excellency (Gov. Sani Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are here to discuss the issues going forward. We are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention which is at hand on March 26.

These members of the CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country. So, it is not a formal meeting that one will ask whether the secretary is here or not. However, he was in the house earlier today.\u201d\n\nRecounting his stewardship while he acted, Gov. Abubakar Sani Bello said, \u201cI have been acting as the chairman of CECPC and what I can tell you is that we made lots of progress towards our convention like we saw in the inauguration of the State Chairmen, adopted some of the zoning formulae, and some of the decisions of the CECPC taken before he (Buni) left the country.

If you say everything done in the absence of the substantive chairman has been thrown away, that, too, will be thrown away.\n\n\u201cSo it is a way of dousing tension and not giving room for further media feast on a probable crisis in the ruling party.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after the meeting, Governor Buni defended the absence of his secretary, Akpanudoedehe, arguing that he was part of them since it was not a formal meeting.\n\nOn the purpose for the meeting, Governor Buni, said: \u201cYou know that since I travelled the party has not stopped. His Excellency, Governor Bello, has done very well in managing the affairs of the party in my absence.\n\n\u201cWe are here to discuss issues about going forward. We are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention which is already at hand on March 26. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead.

I can tell you for free that in the last one week, we have ensured that we are good to go for convention,\u201d he said.",

He noted, for the record, that he properly transferred power to his Niger State counterpart to act in his stead while he was away on medical grounds.\n\n\n\nHowever, in a shocking turn of events, Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, yesterday, described what was going on in the governing APC as a charade and said he was done with the party. El-Rufai added that, with the situation of things, unity was impossible in APC.\n\n\n\nDespite boasting that he remained the secretary of CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe was yesterday absent at a meeting convened by Buni with Bello\u2019s team. The meeting, held at the lodge of the Yobe State governor in Abuja, was his first since his return to the country.\n\n\n\nThe national secretary of the party, Akpanudoedehe, had in a statement earlier yesterday, claimed that Buni had approved the dissolution of the sub-convention committees put in place by Bello and reinstated the ones he set up before embarking on a medical trip to Dubai.\n\n\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the chairmanship of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, makes this press release to clarify the events of last week and reassure the membership and stakeholders of the party, as well as the Nigerian people, in general, that the governing party is crisis-free, strong and remains united in giving the country the transformative leadership and good governance, which she promised.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs approved by the chairman, HE. (Gov.) Mai Mala Buni, please, find below the list of chairmen, deputy chairmen and secretaries of the various sub-committees for the 2022 APC National Convention (as earlier published).\u201d\n\nBut Buni, in a rebuttal issued hours later, noted that the report about the alleged dissolution of the committees was not true.\n\n\n\nBuni\u2019s stated, \u201cThis is to bring to the notice of all stakeholders and members of the party that the purported suspension of some activities initiated and executed by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under the acting chairman and Niger State Governor, H.E. Muhammed Sani Bello, is not true.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting that all activities carried out in his absence remained valid and binding, Buni added, \u201cAll party stakeholders and members are hereby advised to disregard the previous statement discarding the activities of the committee under the leadership of the acting chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Yobe governor recalled that he duly transmitted power to Bello to enable him undergo medical attention.\n\nBuni said regarding Bello, \u201cTherefore, all actions and measures taken by the committee under his leadership as acting chairman, remain effective. The party calls for support and understanding to move the party forward to a successful convention slated for March 26th, 2022.\u201d\n\nIt looked very probable that Akpanudoedehe might have lost his job as CECPC secretary, following the latest developments.\n\n\n\nIn a leaked notice dated March 8, 2022 and signed by a majority of the members of the caretaker committee, a vote of no confidence was passed on Akpanudoedehe .\n\nTitled \u201cMotion of no confidence on the Secretary of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee,\u201d the notice was signed by Senator Ken Nnamani, Governor Abubakar Bello, Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, Prof Tahir Mammah, Senator Abba Alli, Mr. David Lyon, Hon. Akinremi Ol\u00e0ide, Mrs Stella Okotete, Mr. Ismaeel Ahmad, and Dr James Lalu.\n\n\n\nMembers of the committee cited Article 17 Sub-section 5 of the APC constitution, which allowed a majority of any constituted ad-hoc committee of the party to pass a vote of no confidence on any member found wanting.\n\nThe notice read, \u201cWe, the members of the CECPC of the All Progressives Congress, duly constituted on the 25th of June, 2020 by the National Executive Committee of our great party, and sitting in our regular meeting on the 8th Day of March 2022, hereby unanimously resolve and adopt a motion of no confidence on the secretary of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, and direct that from today henceforth, he steps aside as the secretary of the committee and stop forthwith all activities and duties associated with the office.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe majority of the caretaker committee members had pulled the rug off Akpanudoedehe\u2019s feet, though this was still subject to ratification by the National Convention or Congress.\n\nAccording to the party\u2019s constitution, where a vote of \u201cNo Confidence\u201d has been passed on an officer, the relevant party organ shall appoint another person to act in his place pending ratification by the National Convention or Congress.\n\n\n\nCorroborating Buni\u2019s position, spokesperson of the Bello leadershi Akpanudoedehe , and National Youth Leader, Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, maintained that the final list of convention planning sub-committees signed by the Director of Organisation following the directive of the caretaker committee remained the final and authentic list.\n\nResponding to news making the rounds about the old list, Ahmed said the CECPC never approved the list and in fact, has no record of such list.\n\n\n\nAhmed, who has been briefing the media since the leadership crisis started, urged party members and the media to ignore the falsehood being spread by Akpanudoedehe.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe approved final list was the outcome of extensive consultations with all the stakeholders and follow-up at ensuring a decent list that is representative and inclusive, is put together and the same has since been issued.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe laughable action of sacked Senator Akpanudoedehe, is, therefore, considered an affront on the committee, which was duly constituted in line with provisions of the party\u2019s constitution and NEC of the party.\n\n\u201cSeeing the unpopular actions of Senator Akpanudoedehe, it is now obvious that he might be surreptitiously working to derail the party, cause internal friction capable of causing further crisis, but the committee against all his antics is determined to forge ahead and ensure the national convention holds as scheduled and approved devoid of any untoward actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a curious development, El-Rufai, yesterday, expressed frustration with the wrangling in the ruling party. He told his colleague governors that he was done with the party, saying unity may be difficult to foster in APC as things currently stood.\n\nEl-Rufai, who addressed other APC governors in what seemed like a WhatsApp message in a group, alluded to betrayal, corruption, greed and other vices in the party, indicating they are the reason he opted out.\n\n\n\nThe messaged read, as shared, \u201cYour Excellences, unity is impossible to attain when leaders that are in office, because we consented to it, are consistently erratic, capricious, corrupt and deceitful.\n\n\u201cLoyalty begets loyalty.\n\n\u201cDeception begets mistrust.\n\n\u201cBetrayal begets revolt.\n\n\u201cIneptness, greed and selfishness threaten to destroy what has been built over nearly a decade, by those who didn\u2019t even know how this party was put together.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s restate that I am done with this charade, unless concrete, honest and transparent steps are taken to implement our agreed plans under a leadership we trusted.\n\n\u201cThank you. Nasir El-Rufai.\u201d\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the developments, Akpanudoedehe reacted earlier today to his purported sack, saying he remains the secretary of the party. The secretary, in a brief chat with journalists, said, President Buhari\u2019s letter superseded everything.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s letter supersedes everything. I remain the secretary of the party,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEven at that, Akpanudoedehe was absent at a meeting at the instance of Buni with the Bello-led committee, who stood in while he was away, yesterday.\n\nThe meeting, which took place at Yobe State Governors\u2019 Lodge in Asokoro, had all members of the caretaker committee in attendance, except Akpanudoedehe.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered the Yobe State governor met with the chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, where he was briefed on the outcome of the forum\u2019s meeting on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nSources close to CECPC said the Bello team met at the Niger State Governor\u2019s Lodge, which is a stone throw from Yobe\u2019s before proceeding to Yobe\u2019s Lodge with other members of the committee.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at his lodge, Buni applauded CECPC members on the level of preparations towards the national convention.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention, which is at hand, on March 26. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 national convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuni further clarified that the visit was not a formal meeting of the CECPC, adding, \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, Bello said, \u201cFor the past one week, I have been acting as the chairman of CECPC and what I can tell you is that we made lots of progress towards our national convention like we saw in the inauguration of the State Chairmen, adoption of some of the zoning formula, and some of the decisions of the CECPC taken before he (Governor Buni) left the country. I can tell you for free that in the last one week, we have ensured that we are good to go for the national convention.\u201d\n\nIn his intervention to the party crisis, a deputy national chairmanship aspirant, Mr. Sunny Monidafe, urged the members of the caretaker committee to resolve whatever differences they had for the sake of the party.\n\nMonidafe, who made the call after obtaining his form yesterday, said, \u201cI will want to appeal to both sides to keep calm. Whatever has happened, I don\u2019t want to know, I want to come in and reconcile party members.\u201d\n\nMonidafe boasted that he was the most qualified for the position of the national chairman, but had to abide by the zoning arrangement of the party.\n\nIn the same vein, a group under the auspices of Progressives Youth Movement, declared that the purported sack of the secretary would not stand.\n\nChairman of the group, Mr. Mustapha Audu, said there was no need to fight each other at this stage, saying all that is needed is to support the party and chairman to hold the convention.\n\nAudu stated, \u201cWe are here because there have been various media reports regarding the purported sack of the secretary of the party, Senator James John Akpanudoedehe. We are here to say the purported sack cannot stand.\n\n\u201cNine days to the national convention of the party, all hands should be on deck. We saw the letter this morning by our National Youth Leader, Barrister Ismaeel Ahmed. We believe we should be working hand-in-hand to deliver for the party and the convention.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Declares anyone playing politics with security riding on a tiger\n\n*Bianca, ex-first lady went physical at ceremony, slaps Obiano\u2019s wife\n\n*EFCC arrests former gov at Lagos airport\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nFormer governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, yesterday, talked tough at his inauguration as the sixth elected governor of Anambra State, saying his administration would do everything humanly possible to end every form of criminality in the state.\n\n\n\nThe new Anambra governor, who read riot act to politicians, whose stock in trade was to play politics with security, however, warned that with the coming in of his administration, they would be riding a tiger doing so, especially on account of the increasing killings in the state.\n\n\n\nSoludo, who identified security as a major challenge to tackle head-on in his inaugural speech, drove into the arena to the awe of the people and guests, as he and his deputy, Gilbert Ibezim, arrived in vehicles made by local manufacturer, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM).\n\n\n\nHe did not stop at that, he also walked his talk by appearing in his locally made Akwete dress, and a pair of shoes made in Ogbunike, Oyi Local Government area, in addition to ensuring that local foods were served as refreshments, including palmwine, abacha, ukwa and other native delicacies, as well as locally produced beers and malt drinks.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, what was to be a moment to cherish by the new governor soon evoked regrets after fight broke out between the immediate past first lady, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano, and wife of the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the eternal leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu.\n\nMrs. Obiano got up from her seat, walked up to Bianca and after a brief altercation muttered in hushed tones, resulting in slaps from the former beauty queen, fight ensued. It took security aides a while to restore order.\n\n\n\nEven more, the day did not end on a pleasant note for the immediate past governor of the state, Chief Willie Obiano, who was arrested last night at the Lagos airport by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), as he was about to jet out of the country.\n\nSoludo was sworn in by the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu at the Government House, Awka, in a low key ceremony.\n\n\n\nThe professor of econometrics, had opted for a low key function for his swearing in, while also rejecting plan by his predecessor to hold the event at the spacious newly completed International Convention Centre, Awka.\n\nSupporting his action, Soludo in his inaugural speech said, \u201cThe Anambra State Government will only patronise Made-in-Anambra products and services unless such goods or services are not currently made in Anambra, then made in Nigeria, Africa, etc, in that sequence.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you see me in Innoson vehicles or in my Akwete dress with a pair of shoes made in Ogbunike/Nkwelle Ezunaka and Onitsha, we are making a statement.\n\n\u201cToday, the light refreshment to be served after this brief event is abacha from Umunze, ukwa from Isuofia, Anambra rice with ofe akwu, nkwu enu from Awgbu, ngwo from Awa and Oba, and malt and bottled water from Onitsha.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs part of our Made-in-Anambra, cultural renaissance and healthy living agenda, when you come to the Governor\u2019s Lodge or attend any state government\u2019s function, be sure to be served only Made-in- Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe want to go back to where M.I. Okpara stopped with the palm revolution and plant millions of palm trees. In some years, we will seek not only to export palm produce but also fresh palm wine from Anambra State.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after his swearing-in ceremony, Soludo said, \u201cMy heart bleeds to see and hear about our youth dying in senseless circumstances. Every criminal gang \u2013 kidnappers, wicked murderers, arsonists, rapists, thieves \u2013 all now claim to be freedom fighters. Criminality cannot be sugar-coated. This must stop.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the stakeholders must now review both the narrative and the action plan. For starters, I endorse the recent statement (March 7, 2022) by the Joint Body of South East Council of Traditional Rulers and Bishops/Archbishops on Peace and Conflict Resolution, requesting for a tripartite discussion between them, the Presidency, and south-east governors to deal with the conflicts in the south-east especially, in relation to Nnamdi Kanu and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no conflict that dialogue, in good faith, cannot resolve. Our government is determined to urgently restore peace and security in Anambra, and we will seek the active cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nSoludo told members of IPOB/ESN, the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), and other armed groups to interrogate both the purpose and means of their campaign, and warned politicians playing politics with insecurity, that they were riding a tiger.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current trajectory is a road to desolation. Let us get around the table and talk. Let the elite in the closet come out, and let\u2019s debate our future and forge a consensus. The conspiracy of silence by the elite and some community leaders must end.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you see something, say or do something. Securing Igboland and Nigeria must be our collective responsibility. Let those in the forests come out, surrender their guns and let\u2019s work together to rehabilitate and empower you to contribute positively to the peace and prosperity of our homeland,\u201d Soludo said.\n\n\n\nOn why his inauguration was a low key event, Soludo said, \u201cToday is my first day at work. I just reported for duty and will work for at least eight hours. We had more than a month since the election to celebrate our historic victory. Now is the time to work, and there is no minute or kobo to waste in fanfare.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of the administration, and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra State Security Council, followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries, a meeting on Okpoko, and with my Strategy, Execution and Evaluation (SEE) team.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithin the next one week, the list of Commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly. Tomorrow, we will head to Okpoko in Ogbaru Local Government Area and parts of Onitsha and Idemili as we signpost our commitment to fundamental urban regeneration, beginning with the greater Onitsha metropolis.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe former CBN governor said, \u201cI insisted that this event must not cost the government of Anambra one kobo. I would rather use such resources to lay the foundation stone for a public hospital at Okpoko or elsewhere or empower our security agents to fight criminality.\n\n\u201cYes, there will be a time to celebrate. We will celebrate when security of life and property is guaranteed and law and order restored; every child of schooling age is in school; every school child is receiving the 21st century education for the digital age.\u201d\n\nBianca, Ex-First Lady Went Physical at Event, Slaps Obiano\u2019s Wife\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Obiano engaged in a fight with Bianca Ojukwu at the venue and subdued the poise of the inauguration with their filthy fisticuffs.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady, who seemed to have come set for a fight had approached Mrs Ojukwu at the front row of the event, where she was seated close to Chief Willie Obiano, allegedly warning her about coming to an APGA function, after she had attacked the party during the November election.\n\n\n\nMrs Obiano had said something things to Mrs Ojukwu, including touching, a situation the latter warned repeatedly against, causing Mrs. Ojukwu to smack her on the cheeks, while the former first lady attempted to fight back, before security operatives separated them.\n\nEarlier, THISDAY witnessed the arrival of Mrs Obiano as she was stopped at the gate, when her convoy attempted to use the main gate.\n\n\n\nShe had come late for the event, while her husband had arrived much earlier, and had already inspected the guard of honour, and the swearing-in ritual for the new governor was ongoing.\n\nA barricade at the expressway leading into the Government House was locked with keys, while Mrs Obiano was advised by security men to drive down to a far away junction and turn into a smaller gate that led to the Government House.\n\n\n\nBut Mrs Obiano refused and later trekked from the express to the main gate, where she also caused a stir, before the gate was opened for her, while she trekked into the Government House, where the function held, abandoning her convoy.\n\nMrs Obiano and her husband however left the ceremony immediately after Soludo was sworn in.\n\nThe former CBN governor, in a statement by his media aide, Mr Joe Anatune, said the fight was caused by a breach of protocol.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cProf. Soludo hereby apologises to all Anambra people, friends and guests, who attended his inauguration this morning as the Anambra State governor for the breach of protocol.\n\n\u201cThe breach was caused by improper communication, which itself arose from a personal issue between the two parties involved in the breach. Steps are being taken to resolve the misunderstanding and restore the parties to their previous relationship.\n\n\u201cAnambra State has over the years been known for a huge stock of social harmony, and the stock will increase substantially in the years ahead as part of the concerted effort to accelerate the state\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nEFCC Arrests Former Governor at Lagos Airport\n\n\n\nIn another development, Obiano, who had been on the EFCC watchlist for months, was arrested at about 8.30pm, while on his way out of the country to Houston, Texas in the United States.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the EFCC had requested the Nigeria Immigration Service to inform it anytime the former governor was travelling out of the country from any of the international airports, as well as other points of entry and exit.\n\nAlthough THISDAY could not ascertain why EFCC placed Obiano on a watchlist and subsequently arrested him, sources, however, claimed the move was a clear indication that the agency had been quietly looking into his activities and might have gleaned intelligence that he was planning to escape after handing over power.\n\nObi Expresses Optimism New Governor Will Do Well\n\n\n\nBut, political differences notwithstanding, a former governor of the state, Mr. Peter Obi, has said despite being from a different party from Soludo and even campaigning against him during the elections, his ultimate desire was to see a better Anambra State that ensures the well-being of the people.\n\nObi, who stated that politics, for him, was about building a better society, especially, for the less privileged, because government or governance, was all about caring for the people, however, expressed optimism Soludo would do well.\n\nAddressing journalists at the inauguration ceremony, Obi argued that, considering Soludo\u2019s background, he was confident that he would commit to the critical areas of development, which he listed to include education, health and poverty alleviation, even as he expressed hope that the new governor would fulfill his campaign promises.\n\n\u201cI will continue to remember our new governor and other leaders in my prayers, so that they can continue to make the right decisions for the good of our dear nation, Nigeria,\u201d Obi concluded.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Seeks strong leaders in 2023\n\n*Says sufferings despite natural endowments inexplicable\n\n*MAN demands removal of VAT from diesel prices, threatens retrenchment\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nBusinessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr Tony Elumelu, yesterday bemoaned the fact that Nigeria was losing over 95 per cent of its oil production to thieves.\n\n\n\nThis is just as the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has described the rising price of Automotive Gas Fuel (AGO) otherwise known as diesel as a very worrisome development that has been impacting businesses negatively, especially the manufacturing sector of the economy.\n\n\n\nElumelu, who narrated the ordeal of some of his colleagues at work on his official Twitter handle, noted that apart from the economy, Nigerians are now afraid as a result of the bad security situation.\n\n\n\nElumelu, who is the founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, a platform which promotes entrepreneurship in Africa, urged Nigerians to be \u201cvocal\u201d about the way they are governed and hold their leaders more accountable.\n\nHe added: \u201cHow can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000bpd barrels of crude oil daily, instead it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator , Shell to declare force majeure.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying taxes if our security agencies can\u2019t stop this? It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple!\u201d\n\nElumelu pointed out that while oil producing countries were happy that prices had been rising and their foreign reserves continue to grow, Nigeria is in a state of gloom.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, oil producing countries are smiling as their foreign reserves rising. What is Nigeria\u2019s problem? We need to hold our leaders more accountable,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nHe decried the worsening state of insecurity, public infrastructure and rising inflation in Nigeria.\n\nThe usually reticent businessman, who chairs the Board of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), argued that being endowed with huge natural resources, the country should not be in its current decrepit state.\n\n\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, the state of basic supplies, like electricity and petrol, have worsened, as Nigerians spend time in queues to buy petrol and businesses and homes suffer due to prolonged blackouts. Diesel price has also risen astronomically.\n\n\n\nThe already bad state of power supply worsened in the last few weeks, with the authorities blaming shortage of gas and dipping water levels at the country\u2019s hydropower stations for the development.\n\nIn addition, the prices of goods and services have recently skyrocketed, with diesel increasing by about 300 per cent and airline operators threatening to stop their services due to galloping aviation fuel prices.\n\nElumelu, who narrated the ordeal of some of his colleagues at work on his offical Twitter handle, noted that apart from the economy, Nigerians now lived in fear due to the security situation.\n\n\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cThis morning, I am listening to my colleagues at the office bemoan the very pressing issues that they face everyday in this country, and how things have been getting worse and worse \u2013 no electricity for five days, hikes in the price of diesel, frightening food inflation, etc.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can a country so rich in natural resources have 90 per cent of its citizens living in hardship and poverty? I have often said that access to electricity is critical for our development, alleviation of poverty and hardship. And speaking of security, our people are afraid! Businesses are suffering.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe businessman, who holds a controlling interest in Transnational Corporation (Transcorp), also wrote about the country\u2019s energy sector, stressing that oil theft, not lack of investment in the upstream, was generally responsible for Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cHow can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200, 000bpd of crude oil, instead it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator, Shell, to declare force majeure.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying taxes if our security agencies can\u2019t stop this? It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple!\u201d\n\nElumelu pointed out that while oil producing countries were happy with the rising prices and their foreign reserves continued to grow, Nigeria was in a state of gloom.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, oil producing countries are smiling as their foreign reserves are rising. What is Nigeria\u2019s problem? We need to hold our leaders more accountable,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the forthcoming election, Elumelu urged Nigerians to be intentional about what they want and support leaders that will deliver.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cElections are coming \u2013 security and resources need to be everyone\u2019s agenda \u2013 let\u2019s be vocal for our nation\u2019s priority.\n\n\u201cEvil prevails when good people are silent. We need to be vocal about 2023. Let\u2019s focus on Nigeria. Demand and advocate for leaders that deliver. In 2023, Nigeria must be on a strong trajectory for progress and development.\u201d\n\nMAN Demands Removal of VAT from Diesel Prices, Laments High Price\n\nMAN decried the rising price of diesel. The association also requested that the government should remove Value Added Tax (VAT) on diesel in order to ameliorate the pain from the rising cost of energy, which it said constituted more than 40 per cent of the operating cost of Nigerian manufacturers.\n\n\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Director General of MAN, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, attributed the current scarcity of petroleum products to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has pushed the price of crude oil in the international market above $110 per barrel.\n\nAjayi-Kadri lamented that manufacturers were left at the mercy of the vagaries of international price and the accompanying geopolitics.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cAs long as the price of crude oil continues to go up, price of AGO will equally skyrocket. It is now said to be selling at N750 per litre, up from about N300 per litre in the past two months.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, manufacturers, who largely rely on diesel to run their factories, due to unreliable nature of the grid power supply, are contending with huge cost to sustain their production line. The information from MAN members equally indicates that the production capacity utilisation has been going down because of the unsustainable cost for running daily production on diesel.\u201d\n\n\n\nAjayi-Kadri noted, \u201cThe direct implication of this trend, as many Nigerians are already feeling the heat, is the reflective high cost of goods in the market owing to the high cost of production.\n\n\u201cMaking the matter worse is the inadequate energy supply for the manufacturing sector from the national grid. It is on record that more than N100billion is expended per year by our members on alternative energy source, which constitutes between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of their cost structure.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe implication is that our cost structure is thrown overboard; our working capital will be depleted by this one cost item, our capacity utilisation will nose-dive since we cannot run as many shifts as we normally do, we may have to right size to fit our production profile.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe solution is rather complex. We are dealing with a deregulated industry, as I earlier mentioned. In the short term, we can only look at how to get more favourable prices from the marketers; seek to remove other costs that are in-country, like VAT on the AGO, and work with government to reduce the pressure in other pain points for the manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernments should deliberately prioritise supply to the sector in view of the multiplier effect it has on the economy and government revenue. The eligible customer scheme should be allowed to work without any hindrance, including the requirement of no-objection from the DisCos. The tariff structure that makes the maximum demand customer to pay more should be re-examined.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some financial experts have expressed surprise over the marginal increase of 0.1 per cent of the headline inflation reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), from 15.60 per cent in January to 15 .70 per cent in February 2022.\n\nNBS also reported that food inflation declined from 17.13 per cent in January to 17.11 per cent in February 2022 while core inflation sub-index accelerated from 13.87 per cent in January to 14.01 per cent in February 2022.\n\nThe experts argued that the NBS\u2019 figures were far from the reality experienced by Nigerian households and businesses during the period under review. They added that marginal growth in the inflation rate reported in the preceding month might put the reputation of the NBS at risk.\n\nChief Executive Officer of BIC Consultancy Services Limited, Dr. Boniface Chizea, said the NBS release, which indicated that the rate of \u201cinflation rose marginally from 15.6 to 15.7 per cent for last month is a bit surprising, to say the least.\u201d\n\nChizea said even though, \u201cOne will not want to impugn the integrity of the NBS, as we believe it has burnished its credentials as a thoroughly professional body in the past. But what is not incontrovertible is that the price system in the economy seems to have fallen apart. There is no aspect of life that has not today witnessed ravaging run away price rise!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is very difficult to reconcile the marginal increase in rate of inflation month on month that has just been reported.\n\n\u201cSo, what we are trying to do now is to serve notice, to put everyone on the alert! The NBS must struggle not to take Nigerians for granted, otherwise, its continued relevance, which had so far been taken for granted, will be discounted.\n\n\u201cAnd that would be a serious development, as it has the potential to undermine its future amongst a generality of Nigerians, even also amongst international stakeholders, which will be too bad.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, an economist and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, found it rather curious that food price inflation recorded a decline of .02 per cent during the period under review as, \u201cthe reality and severity of the impact of the intense inflationary pressures over the past one year is at variance with the official inflation data.\u201d\n\nYusuf, in a statement titled, \u201cCPPE Comments on February Inflation Figures,\u201d stated, \u201cThe technical computation of the inflation figures by the NBS is not in dispute. However, the reality and severity of the impact of the intense inflationary pressures over the past one year is at variance with the official inflation data.\u201d\n\nHe stated further, \u201cFor the basket of goods consumed by most households, prices have jumped by between 30 and 100 per cent over the past one year. The same is true of businesses.\n\n\u201cThe pressure of spiking inflation on household budgets has been excruciating and unbearable. Purchasing power has been massively eroded, real incomes have depressed, and the poverty situation has consequently worsened.\n\n\u201cBusinesses have been similarly impacted, as they have been experiencing a slump in sales, turnover and profits margins. The impact on small businesses is even more severe because of their limited capacity to absorb economic shocks.\u201d\n\nYusuf added, \u201cThe spiralling inflation dynamics should be elevated to the level of an economic emergency, deserving an urgent policy response at the highest level of government. The impact on citizens\u2019 welfare is inestimable. The effect on SMEs is troubling. There is elevated social discontent, driven by increasing joblessness and hunger.\u201d\n\nThe CPPE stated that the key drivers of inflation included high and increasing energy cost, worsening currency depreciation, escalating transportation cost, high import duty on manufacturing inputs, illiquidity in the foreign exchange market, bottlenecks in the logistics chain, security concerns and low productivity resulting from structural challenges and weak application of technology, as well as the central bank\u2019s financing of fiscal deficit.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cTo tackle inflation, these key drivers would have to be addressed. All forms of taxes and levies on the importation of petroleum products should be suspended to give a respite on the spiking energy cost. There should also be deeper stakeholder engagements across sectors to develop an enduring strategy on the way forward.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Two Immigration officers have been banned by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), for extorting a 14-year-old passenger at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.\n\n\n\nThis was revealed by the mother of the teenager, identified as Imoteda, who had raised the alarm on Twitter, noting that her child was extorted and left with no money to travel abroad.\n\nMurtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.\n\n\u201cMy 14-year-old daughter, fourteen, is travelling by herself.\n\n\n\n\u201cImmigration took all her money before they let her go. They took money from a 14-year-old. Didn\u2019t even leave her with 1kobo or 1 thousand naira so she can buy food while she waits. How wicked?\n\n\n\n\u201cI am so angry. A child!!!!!!! Why are you stealing money from a child! And you took all of it and didn\u2019t let her call her mother?!!!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhoever was involved, you will die in penury! Your joy will turn to ashes! You will plant seeds and harvest thorns that will tear your flesh,\u201d she had tweeted.\n\n\n\nHowever, FAAN on Friday in a statement on its Twitter page said the officers have refunded the money and their duty cards have been withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith respect to the case of a 14-year-old girl extorted by two Immigration officers at the Lagos Airport, FAAN\u2019s Aviation Security team, after reviewing the CCTV footage was able to identify the culprits.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, the officers were made to refund the exact amount collected from the passenger. Their On Duty Cards were withdrawn permanently and they have been banned from working in any Nigerian Airports.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would like to commend the mother of the child, who escalated the case and assisted immensely in the course of our investigation,\u201d it added.",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls. To him, it\u2019s not all racism though. \u201cYes, they didn\u2019t want black people to cross through first\u2014that\u2019s no surprise. But I also think there were too many people at those borders; everyone was on edge. They got the worst of it, the ones who tried to leave in that first week; they saw the worst of everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after the invasion, almost all the black students had left Ternopil, and only Fortune and his friends were left. \u201cWhen we went out, people glared at us as if to say, \u2018Why are these ones still here?\u2019 That\u2019s when we knew it was time to leave.\u201d\n\nHe packed a suitcase, left most of his belongings behind, and hightailed it to the Hungarian border where French volunteers were helping African students fill out applications for refugee status and living permits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Fortune is writing the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MBCN) qualifying exams in Nigeria, and then finding a way to get to the UK. \u201cBefore all this,\u201d he says. \u201cI was already applying for visas to leave Ukraine for the UK where my brother is.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s journey is not so certain. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure of what\u2019s going to happen to all of us. They say we can transfer to Hungarian schools, but it\u2019s not certain yet. I\u2019d still prefer to finish in Ukraine, though.\u201d She hopes that the war will end before her 30-day permit is up so that she can return to her apartment in Ukraine where most of her belongings are.\n\nWhen we ask Akam about his next steps, no response comes.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend?

Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka.

In recognition of the climate finance needs particularly in Nigeria and the urgent action required to combat climate change as enshrined in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Nigerian Exchange Limited, in 2016, championed efforts along with government and industry stakeholders that culminated in the issuance of the maiden N10.69Bn (c. $25.8 million) 13.48% 5-year green bond in 2017. We are pleased to continue our collaboration with Nigerian Exchange globally recognised institutions such as IFC and CBI to share valuable experiences and best practices on green finance, and promote the development of sustainable finance market across our ecosystem\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking at the training event, Ms. Denise Odaro, Global Head, Investor Relations, IFC, said \u201cGreen bonds are an integral part of advancing sustainability as they facilitate sustainable investments and innovative financing. IFC, as a partner in developing the issuing of green bonds, played a critical role when it launched a Green Bond Program in 2010 to help catalyze the market and unlock investment for private sector projects that support renewable energy and energy efficiency. Since then, IFC has issued globally 178 green bonds in over 20 currencies for over US$10.5 billion. We continue to support our partners, such as the Nigerian Exchange, to provide the right knowledge, tools, and contribute to create enabling conditions for green, social and sustainability issuances.\u201d\n\nThis training is a continuation of the collaboration between NGX and IFC on the promotion of sustainable finance across the Nigerian capital market under IFC\u2019s REGIO Technical Assistance Program for Africa, and builds on a similar training hosted in December 2021.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Members of the National Assembly have been told to build well equipped fire stations as part of their constituency projects to help curb incessant fire outbreaks in the country.\n\nThe acting Controller-general of the Federal Fire Service ( FFS), Karebo Pere Samson, who lamented that fire outbreaks often come at huge economic losses to the nation especially investors, made the appeal on Thursday in Abuja during a media interface.\n\nKarebo, who emphasised the need for the 774 local government areas in the country to have at least three well-equiped fire stations each, pleaded with the 109 members of the Senate and the 360 members of the House of Representatives to always carry out need assessment in their constituencies before dishing out projects\n\nAcknowledging that response time to fire scenes has been a challenge due to bad roads, distance of fire stations from fire scenes and many other factors, the number one fireman called on the National Assembly, UNDP, multinationals agencies, foundations, and other relevant stakeholders to support the bid to increase the number of fire stations in the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cThe National Assembly should make the provision of fire stations and equipment such as fire and rescue trucks, hydraulic platforms, rapid response power bikes, including ambulances and rapid response trucks as part of their constituency projects.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the Federal Fire Service is willing to freely deploy her men to any station built and equip by any organisation or individual,\u201d Karebo said.\n\nThis, he said, was because recent fire incidents at malls, shops and other public buildings have shown that owners of such buildings need to wake up to their responsibility of ensuring the safety of their business premises through absolute compliance to all fire safety requirements.\n\nKarebo added that the Service was working towards deploying Drones to provide intelligence on threats around fire scenes, in the wake of incessant attacks on firefighters across the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added, \u201cI am glad to also mention that the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbeshola, has also directed NSCDC to provide security for our firemen at fire scenes.\u201d\n\nThe CG further stressed the need to expand the National Fire Academy following a request by the Democratic Republic of Congo for Nigeria to help transform the Central African country\u2019s fire department into full-fledged fire service.\n\nHis words, \u201cIt is becoming clearer too that the call to assist DR Congo\u2019s Fire Department to develop and grow into a Service like ours occasioned the need to expand the capacity of our National Fire Academy to an international standard in structure, infrastructure and technology; the quality of lecturers/curriculum nonetheless.\n\n\u201cAn extensive work must be done to raise all our training schools to international standards if we must measure up to a fire service that must stand at per with its global counterparts in performance, preparedness to respond to fire hazards and other disasters/emergencies and technology,\u201d he added\n\nThis is even as he added that Kenya has also requested collaboration with the by them in order to understudy how the synergy between the service and the Nigerian Air Force NAF on aerial firefighting and patrols work.\n\nReeling out his vision for the Service to include massive public enlightenment campaign on fire prevention, developing a robust capacity for public and private buildings, ensuring improvement on fire protection installations, and synergising with the Nigeria Air Force on building their capacity for aerial firefighting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is said that prevention is better than cure, so as a fireman who has spent over three decades fighting fire, i want to categorically state that we can only reduce or prevent fire occurrence through massive public enlightenment, and for me that is paramount in the months ahead.\n\nSpeaking on how this would be achieved, Karebo said the service was developing a strategic framework on fire drills/simulation in all federal government buildings across the states of the federation. The essence of these fire drills is to ensure that occupants of these various buildings are trained on what to do in a situation of fire.\n\nConsidering the current staff strength of the FFS which is 6,000 vis a viz a population of over 200 million Nigerians, you will agree with me that there is need for additional personnel as the number at the moment is way below, considering the population surge. In a bit to complement our staff strength, the Service has established a fire marshal unit that avail Nigerians the opportunity to volunteer in the area of fire prevention and fighting as well as rescue.",

Yekini Nabena, has condemned the purported sack of the imterim national secretary of the party, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, saying only National Executive Committee (NEC) can exercise such power.\n\nAlso, a group of the APC under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) has declared support for the national secretary of the party, Senator Akpanudoedehe.\n\nA letter containing a vote of no confidence on the national secretary emerged Thursday morning revealing that full quorum of the CECPC consisting of 10 members signed the letter sacking Senator Akpanudoedehe.\n\nBut responding to the purported sack while speaking with journalists at the APC national secretariat in Abuja on Thursday, Nabena said such sack can no stand anywhere.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe APC chieftain said those who signed the said sack letter \u201chave no power to remove the Secretary.\n\n\u201cWhat they need is two-third of NEC \u2013 NEC members and not appointed members. The governors are elected, so they are members of NEC, the President is a member of NEC. So, whatsoever Stella Okotete and co were doing amounted to nulity because they don\u2019t have the power, they have failed to read their party constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that Chief Ken Nnamani, who on of the 10 CECPC members that authored the sack letter, is a former Senate President, Nabena said: \u201cKen Nnamani still has the PDP virus in him, that is why he jumped in back and front, that is the problem with Nnamani. And age is also catching up with him. So, I dont blame him. They promised to give him deputy chairman, that is why he has lost his integrity.\n\n\u201cLike I said, the Caretaker Committee members lack the power. In short, they are seen as borrowed members of NEC in the first place, some of them, except the governors among them, are not authentic members of NEC. So, it is an exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a related development, a group of the APC under the aegis of PYM has declared support for the national secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nThe group\u2019s national coordinator, Prince Mustapha Audu, said the purported sack of the interim national secretary was a nulity, adding that the party currently needs unity and not such crisis ahead of the national convention.\n\nAudu called on all and sundry in the party to give Governor Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC support to deliver a free and fair national convention.\n\nHe also said the purported sack of the national secretary was a nulity, adding that the party currently needs unity and not such crisis ahead of the national convention.\n\nAudu called on all and sundry in the party to give governor Mai Mala Buni led CECPC support to deliver a free and fair national convention.\n\n\u201cWe have a legal way of removing anybody from a committee and I think only the NEC has the authority to do that. I don\u2019t believe a committee that was set up has the authority to sack a member of that committee that was set up by NEC, especially a member who is superior in position. I think that is absolutely impossible but we would leave that for the legal team to look into that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAPC as a party is very important to come together as a party and allow the law. INEC has received all letters and notifications from the chairman and the caretaker secretary, the president has also sent a letter with clear directives we should return to status quo immediately and we should stop all the internal rancour and all the internal issues.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you we are all politicians, we all have different interests. We need to put the interest on Nigerian people, the interest of Mr President and the interest of the APC above all our personal interests.\n\n\u201cWe must have our convention and after the convention we can come back to being politicians but for now we must think about the APC, we must think about our the party not our personal interests,\u201d PYM national coordinator stated.",
          "summary": "Yekini Nabena, has condemned the purported sack of the imterim national secretary of the party, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, saying only National Executive Committee (NEC) can exercise such power.\nAlso, a group of the APC under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) has declared support for the national secretary of the party, Senator Akpanudoedehe.\nBut responding to the purported sack while speaking with journalists at the APC national secretariat in Abuja on Thursday, Nabena said such sack can no stand anywhere.\nADVERTISEMENTThe APC chieftain said those who signed the said sack letter \u201chave no power to remove the Secretary.\n\u201cWhat they need is two-third of NEC \u2013 NEC members and not appointed members.",

          "title": "As first step towards APC reconciliation: Buni meets Bello, ratifies decisions taken as acting CECPC chair \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "As a first move towards reconciling various tendencies within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the chairman Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni, Thursday met with Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello who stood in while the former was on medical trip to the United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe party chairman returned to the country Wednesday night after the trip as well as a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in London over the party\u2019s leadership crisis.\n\nThe meeting held at the Yobe state Governors\u2019 Lodge Asokoro Abuja.\n\nWhile the CECPC Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, was conspicuously absent, other committee members were in attendance.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Governor Buni commended Governor Sani-Bello for a job well done while he was away; saying all decisions taken by Sani-Bello had been duly affirmed by the party.\n\nBuni said: \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward. We are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention which is at hand on March 26. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 national convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nAsked about the absence of Senator Akpanudoedehe at the meeting, Buni said: \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of the CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country. So, it is not a formal meeting that one will ask whether the secretary is here or not. However, he was in the house earlier today.\u201d\n\nOn his own, Governor Sani-Bello, who acted as the chairman during Buni\u2019s absence, said: \u201cFor the past one week, I have been acting as the chairman of CECPC and what I can tell you is that we made lots of progress towards our convention like we saw in the inauguration of the State Chairmen, adopted some of the zoning formula, and some of the decisions of the CECPC taken before he left the country. I can tell you for free that in the last one week, we have ensured that we are good to go for convention.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sani-Bello inaugurated the convention sub-committees and received the report on zoning of party offices among others.\n\n\u2018Bello\u2019s actions remain\u2019\n\nAlso, the Buni leadership of the party has affirmed all actions taken in his absence by Sani-Bello while he was out of the country.\n\nThe Yobe state governor made the clarification after several reports claimed he had dumped the national convention sub-committee list earlier adopted by Bello in an apparent move to assert his leadership after the President Buhari\u2019s endorsement.\n\nFollowing a botched attempt by some APC governors to remove the Yobe state governor, Buhari wielded the big stick Wednesday and directed that Buni be allowed to continue as the party chairman and also take charge of the convention.\n\nHowever, Buni, in a rebuttal Thursday, faulted the reports that all action taken by Bello in his absence had been reversed.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Buni affirmed that \u201call activities that were done in my absence remain valid and binding.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThis is to bring to the notice of all stakeholders and members of the party that purported suspension of some activities initiated and executed by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under the acting Chairman and Niger State Governor, H.E Muhammed Sanni Bello, is not true.\n\n\u201cTherefore, all activities that were done in my absence remain valid and binding. All party stakeholders and members are hereby advised to disregard the previous statement discarding the activities of the committee under the leadership of the Acting Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt could be recalled that I duly transmitted power to His Excellency, the Niger State Governor, H.E Muhammadu Sanni Bello to enable me undergo medical attention. Therefore, all actions and measures taken by the committee under his leadership as Acting Chairman remain effective.\n\n\u201cThe party calls for support and understanding to move the party forward to a successful convention slated for March 26th, 2022.\u201d\n\nC\u2019ttee\u2019s scribe sacked?\n\nMeanwhile, fresh facts have emerged that 10 members of the CECPC actually passed a vote of no confidence on the committee\u2019s scribe.\n\nBut APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena condemned the purported sack, saying only the National Executive Committee (NEC) can exercise such power.\n\nA letter containing the vote of no confidence on the secretary revealed that full quorum of the committee of the 2/3rd requirement, consisting of 10 members, signed the letter.\n\nQuoting relevant sections of the party\u2019s constitution, the letter said: \u201cAkpanudoedehe steps aside as the Secretary of the Committee and stop forthwith all activities and duties associated with the office.\n\n\u201cWe, the members of the CECPC of the APC as duly constituted on the 25th of June, 2020 by the National Executive Committee (NEC) of our great party, and sitting in our regular meeting on the 8th day of March 2022, hereby unanimously resolved and adopt a motion of No Confidence on the Secretary of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC.\n\n\u201cWe direct that from today henceforth, he steps aside as the Secretary of the Committee and stop forthwith all activities and duties associated with the office.\n\n\u201cThe undersigned are a full quorum of the Committee of the 2/3rd required. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, Senator Ken Nnamani, Sen Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, Prof Tahir Mamman, Sen Abba Aji, David Lyon, Hon Akinremi Olaide, Mrs Stella Okotete, Barr Ismaeel Ahmed and Dr James Lalu.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s wrong \u2013 Nabena\n\nBut responding to the purported sack, Nabena told journalists at the APC national secretariat such sack cannot stand anywhere.\n\nThe APC chieftain said those who signed the said sack letter \u201chave no power to remove the secretary.\n\n\u201cWhat they need is two-third of NEC \u2013 NEC members and not appointed members. The governors are elected, so they are members of NEC, the President is a member of NEC. So, whatsoever Stella Okotete and co were doing amounted to nullity because they don\u2019t have the power, they have failed to read their party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that Chief Nnamani is a former Senate President, Nabena said: \u201cKen Nnamani still has the PDP virus in him, that is why he jumped in back and forth, that is the problem with Nnamani. And age is also catching up with him, so, I don\u2019t blame him. They promised to give him Deputy Chairman that is why he has lost his integrity.\n\n\u201cLike I said, the Caretaker Committee members lack the power. In short, they are seen as borrowed members of NEC. In the first place, some of them, except the governors among them, are not authentic members of NEC. So, it is an exercise in futility.\u201d\n\n\u2018Akpanudoedohe on ground\u2019\n\nIt was also gathered that the CECPC scribe was on ground, contrary to report that he had been sacked.\n\n\u201cBuni\u2019s camp has won the leadership tussle but wants to be mature in handling things by now carrying everyone along.\n\n\u201cYou know he (Bello) inaugurated state chairmen, which Buni was supposed to do before he travelled. If you say everything done in the absence of the substantive chairman has been thrown away, that, too, will be thrown away.\n\n\u201cSo it is a way of dousing tension and not giving room for further media feast on a probable crisis in the ruling party,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn Akpanudoedohe\u2019s fate, the source declared: \u201cHe is on ground, no one has removed him.\u201d\n\nGroup backs APC scribe\n\nIn a related development, an APC group- the Progressive Youth Movement (PYM)- has declared support for the party\u2019s national secretary.\n\nThe group\u2019s national coordinator, Prince Mustapha Audu, described the purported sack as a nullity, adding that the party currently needed unity and not such crisis ahead of the national convention.\n\nAudu called on all and sundry in the party to give the Buni-led CECPC support to deliver a free and fair national convention.\n\nCourt hears suit today\n\nMeanwhile, the FCT High Court sitting in Kubwa, has slated Friday for hearing in a suit seeking to stop the APC\u2019s national convention.\n\nThe plaintiff in the matter, Salisu Umoru, dragged APC, the CECPC Chairman Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before the court to challenge the planned convention.\n\nJustice Bello Kawu fixed the date for hearing following the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Mike Enaharo-Ebah\u2019s application for an adjournment.\n\nIn his argument, Enaharo-Ebah told the court that he needed time to go through some applications due to the clash of representation of defence counsel March 15.\n\nHe said there were two counsels for APC and Buni and the court adjourned the matter until Thursday for report of proper representation which had been resolved.\n\n\u201cWe need to address his processes since issues of representation has been resolved and ask for a short adjournment to enable us file counters and written addresses with some of the pending bail applications, \u201dEnaharo-Ebah said.\n\nAlso responding, the defence counsel, Shuaibu Aruwa (SAN), said he filed a notice of change of counsel duly served to the plaintiff March 10 with his address endorsed on it.\n\nAruwa, however, urged the court to discountenance the claimant\u2019s application for adjournment and hear the pending application.\n\nBefore hand, the defence counsel told the court he had written two separate letters to the court March 16 as representing the defendants.\n\nAruwa said one of the letters was signed on behalf of the APC by Head of Legal Services, Dare Oketabi, and the second signed by the second defendant, Buni, confirming that Aruwa\u2019s law firm was briefed to represent the defendants in the suit.\n\nUmoru, had in his reliefs, sought an order directing the APC and its chairman CECPC, Buni, to stop its planned national convention.\n\nHe also sought an order directing Buni to begin reconciliation process to resolve all the disputes that emanated from the local government congresses before the conduct of the party\u2019s convention.\n\nThe court, Blueprint reported, granted an interim injunction last year, restraining the APC from proceeding with its planned convention.\n\n",
          "summary": "The party chairman returned to the country Wednesday night after the trip as well as a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in London over the party\u2019s leadership crisis.\nWhile the CECPC Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, was conspicuously absent, other committee members were in attendance.\nWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention which is at hand on March 26.\nCourt hears suit todayMeanwhile, the FCT High Court sitting in Kubwa, has slated Friday for hearing in a suit seeking to stop the APC\u2019s national convention.\nUmoru, had in his reliefs, sought an order directing the APC and its chairman CECPC, Buni, to stop its planned national convention.",

          "text": "Facing stiff resistance in Ukraine and crippling economic sanctions at home, Russian President Vladimir Putin is using language that recalls the rhetoric from Josef Stalin\u2019s show trials of the 1930s.\n\nPutin\u2019s ominous speech on Wednesday likened opponents to \u201cgnats\u201d who try to weaken the country at the behest of the West \u2014 crude remarks that set the stage for sweeping repressions against those who dare to speak out against the war in Ukraine.\n\nHis rant appeared to reflect his frustration about the slow pace of the Russian offensive, which bogged down on the outskirts of Kyiv and around other cities in northeastern Ukraine. Russian forces made comparatively bigger gains in the south, but they haven\u2019t been able to capture the strategic port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, and their advance along the Black Sea coast also has stalled.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has been battered by devastating Western sanctions that cut the government\u2019s access to an estimated half of the country\u2019s hard currency reserves and dealt crippling blows to many sectors of the economy.\n\nWith his hopes for a blitz in Ukraine shattered and economic costs mounting swiftly, Putin unleashed a venomous diatribe at those who oppose his course.\n\n\u201cThe Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths \u2014 spit them out on the pavement,\u201d Putin said during Wednesday\u2019s call with top officials. \u201cI am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to respond to any challenges.\u201d\n\nThe coarse language carried ominous parallels for those familiar with Soviet history. During show trials of Stalin\u2019s Great Terror, authorities disparaged the declared \u201cenemies of the people\u201d as \u201creptiles\u201d or \u201cmad dogs.\u201d\n\nHis voice strained by anger, Putin charged that Russians who oppose the war in Ukraine were a \u201cfifth column\u201d obsequiously serving Western interests and ready to \u201csell their own mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t condemn those who have villas in Miami or the French Riviera, those who can\u2019t live without foie gras, oysters or so-called gender freedoms,\u201d Putin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. The problem is that many of those people are mentally there (in the West) and not here with our people, with Russia. They don\u2019t remember or just don\u2019t understand that they are just \u2026 expendables used for the purpose of inflicting the maximum damage on our people.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, the Russian State Investigative Committee announced the opening of criminal probes against several people accused of spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d about the military action in Ukraine.\n\nThe first person singled out by the country\u2019s top investigative agency was Veronika Belotserkovskaya, a popular blogger and socialite who has written books about French and Italian cuisine and divides her time between Russia and southern France. She appeared to be a target conveniently fitting Putin\u2019s scathing description of cosmopolitan Russians who love fancy food and are seemingly at odds with the broad masses.\n\nThe investigative committee said it would move to issue an international arrest warrant for Belotserkovskaya, alleging her Instagram posts \u201cdiscredited\u201d state authorities and the military.\n\nBelotserkovskaya responded by writing: \u201cI have been officially declared to be a decent person!\u201d\n\nShe is being investigated under new legislation fast-tracked on March 4 by the Kremlin-controlled parliament, a week after Putin launched the invasion. It envisions prison terms of up to 15 years for posting \u201cfake\u201d information about the military that differs from the official narrative.\n\nPutin and his lieutenants describe the war in Ukraine as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d intended to uproot alleged \u201cneo-Nazi nationalists\u201d and remove a potential military threat against Russia\u2014 goals that most of the world has rejected as bogus.\n\nRussian officials have attributed the offensive\u2019s slow pace to their desire to spare civilians, even as the military pummeled Mariupol, Kyiv, Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities with indiscriminate barrages and airstrikes, killing untold numbers of civilians.\n\nWith the action in Ukraine in stark contrast with official declarations, the authorities acted quickly to control the message, shutting access to foreign media websites, along with Facebook and Instagram and moving to outlaw their parent company Meta as an \u201cextremist\u201d organization.\n\nThe tight lids on information have helped the Kremlin rally support of broad layers of the population who rely on state-controlled television as their main source of news. State TV programs carried an increasingly aggressive message against those who oppose the war.\n\nAsked about incidents in which the apartment doors of war critics were spray-painted with the letter \u201cZ\u201d \u2014 a sign used to mark Russian military vehicles in Ukraine that has been heavily promoted by the state \u2014 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described it as an \u201cemotional\u201d move by Putin\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe campaign in support of the war saw Russian cities flooded with \u201cZ\u201d posters and vehicles emblazoned with it. School children were shown standing in groups in the shape of the letter or wearing clothes marked with a \u201cZ.\u201d\n\nDespite the draconian new laws, tight controls on information and increasingly aggressive propaganda, however, thousands of Russians showed up at antiwar protests across the country to face immediate arrest.\n\nIn a powerful symbol of defiance, an employee of state television interrupted a live news program, holding a handmade sign protesting the war. Marina Ovsyannikova was fined the equivalent of $270, but still faces a criminal probe that could land her in prison.\n\nOne loud voice of dissent was that of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin\u2019s fiercest political foe who is serving 2 1/2 years in prison and now faces a trial that could hand him a 13-year sentence.\n\nIn a speech at his trial Tuesday, Navalny warned that the war will lead to the breakup of Russia, saying that \u201ceveryone\u2019s duty now is to oppose the war.\u201d",

Earlier, he said the missiles had not directly hit Danylo Halytskyi International Airport, which is located six kilometers to the southeast of the city centre.\n\nAlthough Ukraine\u2019s airspace is now closed for civilian passenger planes, in peaceful times passengers could fly from Lviv to more than 50 international destinations across Europe including Madrid, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Milan, Venice and Barcelona. Seasonal flights linked holidaymakers to summer holiday destinations like Alicante, Sharm El Sheikh, and Antalya.\n\nLast Sunday the Russian army bombed a Ukrainian military base near Lviv although the city has been spared fighting so far, and has become a last staging post for many refugees fleeing west into Poland just a short distance away.\n\nIn the buildup to Russia\u2019s invasion on 24 February, a number of embassies moved their operations from the capital Kyiv to Lviv in the west, as it was thought to be a much safer location. Several international media outlets are also using Lviv as a base of operations to broadcast news bulletins.",

          "text": "Businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr Tony Elumelu, on Thursday bemoaned the fact that Nigeria was losing over 95 per cent of its oil production to thieves.\n\nElumelu, who narrated the ordeal of some of his colleagues at work on his official Twitter handle, noted that apart from the economy, Nigerians are now afraid as a result of the bad security situation.\n\nElumelu, who is the founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, a platform which promotes entrepreneurship in Africa, urged Nigerians to be \u201cvocal\u201d about the way they are governed and hold their leaders more accountable.\n\nHe added: \u201cHow can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000bpd barrels of crude oil daily, instead it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator , Shell to declare force majeure.\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying taxes if our security agencies can\u2019t stop this? It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple!\u201d\n\nElumelu pointed out that while oil producing countries were happy that prices had been rising and their foreign reserves continue to grow, Nigeria is in a state of gloom.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, oil producing countries are smiling as their foreign reserves rising. What is Nigeria\u2019s problem? We need to hold our leaders more accountable,\u201d he added.\n\nHe decried the worsening state of insecurity, public infrastructure and rising inflation in Nigeria.\n\nThe usually reticent businessman, who chairs the Board of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), argued that being endowed with huge natural resources, the country should not be in its current decrepit state.\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, the state of basic supplies, like electricity and petrol, have worsened, as Nigerians spend time in queues to buy petrol and businesses and homes suffer due to prolonged blackouts. Diesel price has also risen astronomically.\n\nThe already bad state of power supply worsened in the last few weeks, with the authorities blaming shortage of gas and dipping water levels at the country\u2019s hydropower stations for the development.\n\nIn addition, the prices of goods and services have recently skyrocketed, with diesel increasing by about 300 per cent and airline operators threatening to stop their services due to galloping aviation fuel prices.\n\nElumelu, who narrated the ordeal of some of his colleagues at work on his offical Twitter handle, noted that apart from the economy, Nigerians now lived in fear due to the security situation.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cThis morning, I am listening to my colleagues at the office bemoan the very pressing issues that they face everyday in this country, and how things have been getting worse and worse \u2013 no electricity for five days, hikes in the price of diesel, frightening food inflation, etc.\n\n\u201cHow can a country so rich in natural resources have 90 per cent of its citizens living in hardship and poverty? I have often said that access to electricity is critical for our development, alleviation of poverty and hardship. And speaking of security, our people are afraid! Businesses are suffering.\u201d\n\nThe businessman, who holds a controlling interest in Transnational Corporation (Transcorp), also wrote about the country\u2019s energy sector, stressing that oil theft, not lack of investment in the upstream, was generally responsible for Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota.\n\nIn the forthcoming election, Elumelu urged Nigerians to be intentional about what they want and support leaders that will deliver.\n\nHe said, \u201cElections are coming \u2013 security and resources need to be everyone\u2019s agenda \u2013 let\u2019s be vocal for our nation\u2019s priority.\n\n\u201cEvil prevails when good people are silent. We need to be vocal about 2023. Let\u2019s focus on Nigeria. Demand and advocate for leaders that deliver. In 2023, Nigeria must be on a strong trajectory for progress and development.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos",
