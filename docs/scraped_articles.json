          "text": "Finland and Sweden will submit their bids to join NATO together Wednesday, the two Nordic countries announced, despite Turkey\u2019s threat to block the military alliance\u2019s expansion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy we have taken the same path and we can do it together,\u201d Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said Tuesday during a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.\n\nFinland, which shares a 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden have been rattled by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTheir applications will jettison decades of military non-alignment to join the alliance as a defence against feared aggression from Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned Monday NATO\u2019s expansion may trigger a response from Moscow.\n\nBut the main obstacle to their membership comes from within the alliance despite NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg repeatedly insisting the two countries would be welcomed \u201cwith open arms\u201d.\n\nTurkey has accused Sweden and Finland of acting as a hotbed for terrorist groups and its president insists Ankara will not approve expansion.\n\nAny membership bid must be unanimously approved by NATO\u2019s 30 members.\n\nNiinisto said Tuesday he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Finland and Sweden would be able to secure Turkey\u2019s support.\n\nAndersson and Niinisto are to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington Thursday to discuss their historic bids.\n\nEU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the bloc offered the bids its \u201cfull support\u201d after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels.\n\n\u201cThis will increase the number of member states that are also members of NATO. And this will strengthen and increase the cooperation and the security in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was \u201can important geopolitical change\u201d, he noted.\n\n\u2013 Rising public support \u2013\n\nAfter a marathon debate lasting a day-and-a-half, 188 out of 200 Finnish lawmakers voted in favour of NATO membership, a dramatic reversal of Finland\u2019s military non-alignment policy dating back more than 75 years.\n\n\u201cOur security environment has fundamentally changed,\u201d Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told parliament Monday at the start of the debate.\n\n\u201cThe only country that threatens European security, and is now openly waging a war of aggression, is Russia,\u201d she said.\n\nFinland spent more than a century as part of the Russian empire until it gained independence in 1917. It was then invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939.\n\nFinns put up a fierce fight during the bloody Winter War, but were ultimately forced to cede a huge stretch of their eastern Karelia province in a peace treaty with Moscow.\n\nAccording to public opinion polls, more than three-quarters of Finns want to join the alliance, almost three times as many as before the war in Ukraine began on February 24.\n\nSwedish public support has also risen dramatically, albeit more modestly than in Finland, at around 50 percent.\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde signed the application letter Tuesday.\n\nThe turnaround is also dramatic in Sweden, which remained neutral throughout World War II and has stayed out of military alliances for more than 200 years.\n\n\u2013 Turkish objections \u2013\n\nAnkara has thrown a spanner in the works with its last-minute objections.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Helsinki and Stockholm of harbouring militants from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK).\n\nThe PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state.\n\nSweden has also suspended any arms sales to Turkey since 2019 over Ankara\u2019s military operation in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\u201cWe will not say \u2018yes\u2019 to those (countries) who apply sanctions to Turkey to join NATO,\u201d Erdogan said Monday, adding: \u201cNeither of the countries has a clear stance against terror organisations.\u201d\n\nDiplomatic sources told AFP that Turkey blocked a NATO declaration Monday in favour of Sweden and Finland\u2019s membership.\n\nSweden and Finland have sent delegations to Turkey to meet with Turkish officials.\n\n\u201cSweden is delighted to work with Turkey in NATO and this cooperation can be part of our bilateral relations,\u201d Sweden\u2019s Andersson said, emphasising that Stockholm \u201cis committed to fighting against all types of terrorism\u201d.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has explained how former Governor Peter Odili\u2019s decision to produce his successor in 2007 from the Ikwerre ethnic nationality earned him enemies in the State.\n\nWike regretted that the Ikwerre people that Odili fought for were the first to betray him and put him in the witness box.\n\nHe said: \u201cDr. Odili biggest problem in this state today, people must know the truth, is because he said Ikwerre man must become governor, that\u2019s it. If any man tells you that Odili has committed any other sin, it\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s just because he said Ikwerre man must become governor.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we the Ikwerre people whom he said should be Governor are ones that put him in the witness box. But , I want to appeal to him, forgive, you are a Christian. You are a Christian, forgive all of us.\u201d\n\nWike spoke on Monday night during a State banquet organised at the Government House, Port Harcourt, in honour of Hon. Justice Mary Peter Odili, on her 70th birthday and retirement from the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\nWike recalled how the Odili family suffered blackmail and humiliation because of him, vowed never to grieve or engage in act that would bring them into disrepute.\n\nHe said that Odili\u2019s fatherly advice contributed immensely in his success in the governance and transformation of Rivers State since 2015.\n\nWike said he would remain eternally grateful to Justice Mary Odili, for creating the opportunity for him to meet her husband when he ventured into active partisan politics in 1998.\n\nHe said there was no politician serving at the federal or state level since 1999 that would deny passing through the tutelage of Dr. Odili.\n\nHe said despite the generosity of Dr. Odili and his family, some of those they helped politically regrettably betrayed and humiliated them.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a man who has suffered humiliation, I have never seen a man who has suffered betrayal in life like Dr. Odili\u201d, he said.\n\nWike further asserted that those accusing judiciary of being corrupt were not clean themselves.\n\nHe noted that while corruption in the judiciary undermined the courts\u2019 credibility, persons, who were quick to throw tantrum at judiciary, particularly legal practitioners were culpable as well.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor me, those who are abusing judiciary of corruption, their hands are not clean. Anybody who is abusing judiciary or judges, their hands are not clean. But, that does not also mean that even you in the judiciary should not keep your house in order. That is the truth.\u201d\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the governor urged State High Courts to abide by the provisions of the new Electoral Act prohibiting them from handling pre-election or electoral matters.\n\nHe said some state High Courts were already acting in contravention of the law.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the Electoral Act says anything about pre election or electoral matters, is now to be decided by the Federal High Court\u201d, he said.\n\nOdili said all through his wife\u2019s career as a judicial officer, he never for once attempted to influence her in any matter.\n\nHe recalled two instances when a late traditional ruler in Port Harcourt and his extended family members from Ndoni approached him to intervene in matters before his wife\u2019s court, but he declined and offered to help them pay their legal fees.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWhen I finished being Governor and went to Abuja to spend time with her, and a lot of political cases as you know were rolling over each other.\n\n\u201cAll my friends in Abuja know and they tell each other, the moment you have a case either at the Court of Appeal when she was there or at the Supreme Court, the access you use to have to come as a personal friend ceases until the case is over.\u201d\n\nOdili thanked Wike and the people of Rivers State for honouring his wife after 44 years of meritorious service in the judiciary.\n\nThe Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, described Justice Odili, as an epitome of dignity, hardwork, fairness and excellence.\n\nMuhammad, who was represented by Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, said Justice Odili remained an inspiration to the girl child.\n\n\u201cMy lord has shown what is possible with diligence, hard work and integrity. Through you we see that the sky is the limit,\u201dhe said.",

          "title": "Deborah: NBA postpones Sokoto Conference indefinitely",
          "text": "The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has postponed indefinitely its Section on Public Interest and Development Law (SPIDEL) Conference scheduled for Sokoto between May 22 and 26, following the May 12 lynching of a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State.\n\nNBA President Olumide Akpata, who disclosed this in a statement, said the postponement was not only for the safety of the conferees and guests in the wake of the volatile security situation in the state, but also as a mark of respect for Samuel\u2019s memory.\n\nMiss Samuel, a 200-Level Home Economics student, was gruesomely murdered and her corpse set ablaze allegedly by her co-students at the College for alleged blasphemy.\n\nTwo of the suspects \u2013 Bilyaminu Aliyu and Aminu Hukunci were Monday remanded by a Sokoto Chief Magistrates\u2019 Court.\n\nAkpata said it was \u201cnoteworthy that the NBA Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) held its 2019 Annual Conference in Aba, Abia State while its next conference (2021) was held in the ancient city of Ibadan, Oyo State after the 2020 conference was canceled on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cHaving held the two annual conferences in the old Eastern and Western regions, the Executive Committee of NBA-SPIDEL was unanimous in its resolution that the 2022 Annual Conference should be held in the Northern region, consistent with the NBA\u2019s policy of inclusiveness. I am aware that NBA-SPIDEL sought to bequeath hosting rights on any willing State in the Northern region, and the hosting right was eventually given to Sokoto State when its Governor, H.E Aminu Waziri Tambuwal (Life Bencher) agreed that the Sokoto State Government would be a headline sponsor for the Conference.\n\n\u201cAs a result, I led a delegation to pay a courtesy visit on the Sokoto Governor to finetune preparations for the Conference, and during our meeting, the Sokoto State Government renewed its commitment to ensure a serene and safe environment to host a hitch-free Conference.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee of NBA-SPIDEL led by Dr. Monday O. Ubani and the Central Planning Committee led by Dr. Muiz Banire, SAN, worked round the clock and held extended meetings to finalise plans towards delivering a best-in-class conference. Unfortunately, it was in the middle of all these that we received the sad news of the gruesome killing of Miss Deborah Yakubu, whose murder threw the entire nation into shock and disbelief.\n\n\u201cThe NBA is deeply worried not just by the chilling news of the murder of Miss Deborah Yakubu, but also by the sudden and sad turn of events and the deteriorating security situation in Sokoto State. As such, having critically reviewed the current security condition in Sokoto, it has become apparent that we cannot guarantee the safety of our guest speakers, delegates and other stakeholders that have committed to attend the NBA-SPIDEL\u2019s conference which was designed to put the State in the global spotlight for the duration of the conference and beyond.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Executive Committee of NBA-SPIDEL came to the painful decision to request, and I have approved, that the 2022 NBA-SPIDEL Annual Conference be postponed not only for the safety of our conferees and guests, but as a mark of respect for the memory of the slain Miss Deborah Yakubu.\n\n\u201cThe NBA acknowledges the efforts put in by the Sokoto State Government towards the conference which is now beset by the prevailing security situation. While we recognise that the Sokoto State Government has imposed a curfew to stem the unrest, the NBA urges the State Government to fully collaborate with the Federal Government to initiate measures \u2014 and where necessary deploy its coercive instruments \u2014 to restore peace and order to the State, safeguard lives and property and dissuade vandalism and impunity.\u201d\n\nThe NBA also referenced other \u201cunfortunate developments\u201d around the country in the past week, noting that they had \u201ctrivialised the sanctity of human lives, exposed the weakness in our security architecture, tested our collective resolve as a people, and significantly threatened the unity of Nigeria as a nation.\u201d\n\nAkpata said: \u201cIn the South-East, there were reports of the gruesome killing of security personnel by the now notorious \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 and other non-state actors; in Lagos, a young man (simply identified as David) was reportedly lynched by commercial motorcyclists around Lekki; and in Sokoto, there is the unfortunate and heart-wrenching murder of Miss Deborah Yakubu, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto by some of her school mates for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) is saddened by these developments and\n\nunequivocally condemns extrajudicial killings in any part of the country as\n\nreprehensible, barbaric and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWith particular reference to the Sokoto incident and its aftermath, including riots, destruction of properties and a curfew, the NBA noted that some arrests had been made by the Police and prosecution had begun.\n\nNevertheless, it expressed worry \u201cby yet-to-be confirmed reports reaching us that the suspects have been charged with mere breach of public peace in an episode that cut short Deborah\u2019s life in her prime.\n\n\u201cThe NBA is strongly opposed to a banalisation of the situation, and if these reports are true, then we call on the Sokoto State Government to immediately rethink its prosecution strategy and file charges that truly reflect the gravity of the situation.\u201d",

Hence, the Board reiterates that there is no room for errors in its electronic scoring system nor does it plan to organise another UTME.\n\n\u201cThis clarification became necessary following reports of a purported rescheduling of the UTME from a section of the social media citing phantom errors in the computer scoring system and a purported apology from JAMB to the effect that another UTME would be organised.\n\n\u201cThe Board wishes to state that the report is not only false, mischievous but also misleading and crafted out of the frustration and inability of these fraudsters to dupe unsuspecting candidates owing to the series of innovative strategies the Board had put in place to protect candidates.\n\n\u201cThe public would recall that the Board had envisaged some of these inglorious strategies of these nefarious individuals and had sounded a note of warning to the candidates and the general public alike so as to preclude the possibilities of them falling victims of the evil machinations of fraudsters.\n\n\u201cJAMB, once again, advises the general public to disregard this item of news as it does not emanate from JAMB nor has it authorised any individual or group to make such a pronouncement on its behalf.\n\n\u201cThe Board, therefore, advises candidates to avail themselves of its user-friendly advisories on assessing their 2022 UTME results and other processes through periodic visits to www.jamb.gov.ng.\u201d",

          "text": "From Kenneth Udeh Abuja\n\nSenate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has disclosed that political disposition of Igbo has evolved from what it used to be, stressing that the region can no longer be manipulated in making its political decisions.\n\nFollowing the unwillingness of the South West and South South to support the zoning of the presidential ticket to the South East, Kalu asserted that majority of South East people would back the retention of power in the North by supporting the North East to produce next president.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nKalu, who stated this on Monday during an interview on Channels Television programme, \u2018Politics Today\u2019, said his understanding of the power shift to the southern part of the country was that all regions in the South South, South West and South East would allow the latter to produce the country\u2019s next president. He said the South East had, in the past, supported South West to produce former president Olusegun Obasanjo and the incumbent Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, as well as supported the South South to produce former president, Goodluck Jonathan, insisting that it is time for both zones to support South East.\n\n\u201cWe agreed it is the turn of the South East to produce the president. Later, we started seeing candidates from other zones \u2013 South West and South South. I know the two zones that have not produced the country\u2019s president are South East and North East. I know I don\u2019t have the number but I have other things to win the election.\n\n\u201cDoes equity mean excluding the South East? If Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State wants to talk about equity, he should mention the South East; anything less than that is not equity, it can go back to the North.\n\n\u201cYes, we agreed that power should come to the South but they don\u2019t want the power to come to the South East, so why should I allow them (South West/South South) to take it when they have produced presidents before? We are only wiser today, we are wise people, we are no longer the \u2018mumu\u2019 they used to cheat; we are now very wiser. It is no longer business as usual, we have a game plan and we shall unfold it.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot give it to us, we don\u2019t care where it comes from. What I am telling you is the position of the majority of the Igbo, some might disagree but most that understand politics know this. Because you cannot expect us to continue voting for you and you refuse to vote for us. If we vote for you then you vote for us.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nOn the political orientation of the Igbo from the South East, Kalu maintained they would no longer be misled, saying the Igbo will, henceforth, vote according to mutual benefits.\n\n\u201cWhat you will see in 2023 is the new Igbo thinking and the new Igbo thinking will be based on give and take. If you give me, I give you and if you don\u2019t give me I won\u2019t give you.\n\n\u201cAny southerner that is not from the South East and is coming to run for president is a \u2018betrayer\u2019. They are the ones betraying us so they should find sincerity in their mind to vote for us too.\n\n\u201cWe have supported South West. We supported former president Obasanjo, we supported Osinbajo, we supported Jonathan for five years as vice president and president for six years. Why can\u2019t they support us?\u201d he asked.\n\nWhile defending his decision to step down from the presidential race, he reiterated that the position ought to be zoned to the South East, vowing to reactivate his aspiration if the presidency is zoned to the South East. Kalu, however, said Nigeria needs strong leadership and he believes Lawan is the one that can give the country such.\n\n\u201cI have known him for 41 years. We were roommates at the university. He is strong enough to give the Nigerian people what they are looking for. If we have to do anything rational, Lawan will have my vote because he is from the North East. Anything, except South East, it should go back to the North. We are wiser now. This is the position of most Igbo. If they vote it back to the South East, I\u2019ll reactivate my aspiration.\u201d\n\nAs far as he is concerned, the Senate president played a vital role in stabilising the Nigerian parliament. He said several bills have been passed under Lawan\u2019s leadership, a development Kalu said would be replicated at the presidential level if Lawan wins.\n\nHe said Lawan\u2019s presidential ambition was gathering steam with some candidates ready to step down for the Senate president.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cI want to tell you, I have spoken to nine candidates running for president, and they are ready, already in talks to step down for Lawan,\u201d the lawmaker added.\n\nMeanwhile, a cross section of the Igbo have backed the Senate chief whip\u2019s call that power be retained in the North due to what they described as the refusal of the South West and South South regions to support the South East\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nRallying behind Kalu\u2019s stance, a cross section of the Igbo took to their social media platforms to lend their support for power retention in the North, pledging to vote for the North East to produce the next president.\n\nAnselen Chineke commenting on Channels TV Facebook page said Orji Kalu\u2019s stand is in line with the general opinions of the Igbo in the South East.\n\nObi Egwu opined that the South East were not considered good enough to produce the next president; it made no sense to support any candidate from both the South West and South South.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cIf South East is not good enough to produce president, then why should we support a candidate from South West or South South whom have taken their turns in Obasanjo and Jonathan? OUK go on with the campaign Biko.\u201d\n\nAnother user Orji Uka wrote: \u201cVery strong and valid point, and only the wise will understand. It must be South East for presidency, any other person is gatecrashing.\u201d\n\nCharles Izu Ezeonyirimba expressed that power should go back to the North if the South East is denied the presidency. He wrote: \u201cIf not South East, let it go back to North forever. This is our stand in Igbo land.\u201d\n\nSome other comments as captured also read:\n\nIkenna Nwokedi: \u2018Practically speaking, Kalu is absolutely right. If South South and South West can\u2019t support the South East, why keep power in the South? When both South West and South South have had their turn. Equity and fairness is vital. South East supported Obasanjo in 1999 against Alex Ekwueme, South East supported Jonathan in 2011, why can\u2019t the two geopolitical zones support us. Primarily, winning the primary election has to do with delegates. In a country of 19:17 states ratio. Do the mathematical permutation and you will see that Kalu was very politically empirical.\u201d\n\nMuhammad Shafie: \u2018I like his courage. All these southerners shouting power must return to the South will not agree to zone it to South East. So, who is fooling who?\n\nPrince Kelechi: \u2018If South West and South South can\u2019t support South East presidential bid. No need to support them. It should go back to the North.\u201d\n\nIfeanyi Iheukwumer: \u201cAgreed 100 per cent, if South East can\u2019t produce the president, let the power return to the North\u2026\u201d\n\nChimeremezie Tochukwu: \u201cThank you distinguished senator. You couldn\u2019t have said it any better. Justice, equity and fairness demand not just South but South East to produce the Nigerian president, if not, the North should hold it.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Ibe: \u201c\u2026If the entire South cannot unite and endorse an Igbo man for the sake of equity then let the presidency go back to the North.\u201d",

He said this became imperative because Nigerian students were already frustrated with the ugly development in the nation\u2019s education sector.\n\nAdesoji said: \u201cStudents are in total support of ASUU because they are the one fighting for our rights, and that is why university education should be revitalised.

What is obtainable in the North is different from what is obtainable in the South. We are different people. We are not the same people.\n\n\u201cWe need a new system that will guarantee a free federal structure. I am suggesting that we need a kind of strong zonal provinces at we can call confederation. I am suggesting that we should have six provinces and each province should have its constitution. I know, they (the powers that be) will not listen. But we shall continue to tell them the right thing.\u201d\n\nOkubadejo, who listed his achievements in the diocese within the past 24 years, however, condemned in strong terms the killing of Deborah Samuel, adding that the charges brought to court against the two suspects arrested by police in connection with her death were watery because they bordered on conspiracy and public disturbance, instead of conspiracy and murder charges. He added that \u201cIt is clear that Nigeria is at war and it is North against the South. Can you imagine that 34 lawyers went to court to defend the two suspects?\u201d\n\nCommenting on the 2023 general elections, Okubadejo stated that he did not know if the elections would go or not, saying if the election would hold, the South must put its act together and speak with one voice.\n\n\u201cWe have so many presidential aspirants in the South that want to become president in 2023. This is an indication that they are just trying to fulfil their personal ambitions, and not to change the country positively. So, I urge all the presidential aspirants in the South to come together and chose a credible one among them. If they don\u2019t know or they know it already, the coming out of many presidents from the South, is a strategy to split the votes from the South. So, I suggest to them to go for a credible person aming them, irrespective of political parties.\u201d",

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, has commended 20 top-performing taxpayers whose compliances to tax obligations helped the service surpass its N6 trillion tax collection target in 2021.\n\nNami, in a statement obtained yesterday, noted that the feat was made possible by the uncommon leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari, the active support of its supervisor, the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, the backing of the National Assembly and its leadership as well as the cooperation of all other stakeholders in the tax system.\n\nThe companies included the Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas (NLPG) Company Limited, Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mobil Producing Unlimited, Star Deep Water Petroleum Limited, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited, Chevron Nigeria Limited, Total E& P Nigeria Limited, Airtel Networks Limited, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc, and Dangote Cement.\n\nOthers were Nigerian Breweries Plc, Total Upstream Nigeria Limited, Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited, Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited, British American Tobacco Marketing, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc and Lafarge Africa Plc.\n\n\u201cThe service also appreciates Northern Cables Processing and Manufacturing Limited (NOCACO) and Ikeja Electric Plc for being most improved in tax filing and VAT compliance respectively. We urge all taxpayers to join hands with the Federal Inland Revenue Service to make taxation the pivot of our nation\u2019s development and economic growth,\u201d Nami added.\n\nHowever, the acknowledgment came amidst controversies over specific remittances that had raised questions still begging for answers.\n\nTHISDAY had reported last Friday that MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, which was among the top taxpayers being celebrated, had claimed it remitted the sum of N618.7 billion in both direct and indirect taxes to FIRS in 2021, raising concerns in the public.\n\nNami, in the statement however, commended the contribution of the companies, noting that they defied the harsh global economic conditions imposed by the lingering COVID-19 pandemic to produce a heroic performance in tax payment, compliance and support.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe combined efforts of all taxpayers made it possible for the service to achieve the tax revenue collection of 2021 which provided our governments with necessary funds to meet their social contracts with the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe further highlighted their support and \u201cvery laudable performances in tax compliance, tax payment and timely responses to enquiries\u201d.\n\nMTN had in a statement on April 2, 2022, which was issued by the company\u2019s secretary, Uto Ukpanah, claimed that it paid the sum in direct and indirect taxes to the FIRS in the 2021 tax year, making it the largest single biggest contributor to taxes in Nigeria.\n\nThe company had added that its total tax contribution to all government agencies was 13.5 per cent of FIRS\u2019 total collection for the year.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, MTN Nigeria\u2019s total tax contribution to all government agencies including the FIRS amounted to N757.6 billion while FIRS collected a total of N6.4 trillion tax revenue in the year,\u201d the statement had stated.\n\nNonetheless, THISDAY calculations had revealed that the N618.7 billion tax payment as claimed by MTN represented less than 10 per cent of the N6.4 trillion that was reported as total collection by the service for the year in reference.\n\nHence, MTN\u2019s claim that it contributed 13 per cent of total FIRS collections of N6.4 trillion would mean it actually remitted N832 billion to the federal government in the period in question.\n\nFollowing the apparent discrepancy unraveled by the THISDAY checks, using MTN\u2019s prior statement, the former raised pertinent questions and sought clarification from both the apex revenue agency and the telecommunications company on why the final taxes was under-declared as it appears to be the case.\n\nRegrettably, the FIRS has declined to provide THISDAY with the specific amount paid by the company as taxes but said the figure churned out by MTN does not tally with its own account.\n\nYet, the onus falls on FIRS as a matter of transparency and confidence in the management of public accounts to make proper rendition to Nigerians.\n\nThe development particularly smacks of negligence on the part of the service and requires that both parties unravel the truth.\n\nSources confided in THISDAY that the refusal of both FIRS and MTN to do the needful contradicts the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) which among other things, forbids companies and agencies of the government from withholding critical information that is in the public interest.\n\nObservers also said the attitude of both companies serves to undermine the anti-corruption agenda of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSpecifically, Section 2, sub-section 4 of the FOI Act requires that \u201ca public institution shall ensure that information referred to in this section is widely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means, including print, electronic, and online sources, and at offices of such public institutions.\n\nAnalysts also said MTN Nigeria, as a corporate entity cannot afford to shy away from the principles of transparency and accountability in the interest of its shareholders and the public in general by detailing the various taxes it paid to the government within the year in question.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Tambuwal relaxes curfew in Sokoto, warns against breach of law\n\n\u2022Don\u2019t join planned protest, Sule tells Nasarawa CAN\n\n\u2022Southern, Middle Belt Alliance demands prosecution of perpetrators, condemns destruction of property by Muslim youths\n\n\u2022Berates former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for \u2018insensitivity\u2019\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja, Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto, Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\n\n\nA legal team of 34 lawyers, led by a law lecturer at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Professor Mansur Ibrahim, yesterday, appeared in defence of two suspects, Bilyaminu Aliyu and Aminu Hukunci, arraigned over the murder of Deborah Yakubu.\n\nThe 200-level female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, was stoned to death and burnt last Thursday for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed.\n\nThe court appearance came as Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, relaxed a 24-hour curfew imposed on Sokoto metropolis as a result of protest by irate Muslim youths opposing prosecution of the murder suspects.\n\nIn Nasarawa State, the governor, Abdullahi Sule, appealed to the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) not to join a planned protest by the Christian community across the country against Deborah\u2019s killing. Sule made the call at the state\u2019s security council meeting at Government House, Lafia. He said it was to prevent a possible hijack of the protest by hoodlums.\n\nHowever, the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA), yesterday, demanded accelerated prosecution of those involved in the murder of the late Deborah. SaMBA also berated the former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, for what they described as a \u201clevel of insensitivity not fitting for a president.\u201d That was after Atiku, a presidential aspirant, allegedly deleted his tweet condemning Deborah\u2019s murder following threats by some fanatics to deny him their votes at the forthcoming elections.\n\nThe suspects, Aliyu and Hukunci, also students of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, who appeared before a Sokoto Chief Magistrate\u2019s Court, under tight security, over their alleged involvement in Deborah\u2019s murder, pleaded not guilty to the crime.\n\nIn the First Information Report (FIR), Prosecuting Police Officer, Inspector Khalil Musa, told the court that the suspects were accused of participating in disturbance act that led to the death of Deborah last Thursday.\n\nWhen the charges were read, the accused pleaded not guilty.\n\nIbrahim applied for bail on behalf of the accused persons and urged the court to grant the accused persons bail on liberal terms, citing constitutional provisions and sections of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law.\n\nThe trial judge (name withheld for security reasons) reserved ruling on the bail application and ordered the accused to be remanded at the correctional centre, Sokoto.\n\nThe bloody students\u2019 unrest was caused by an alleged blasphemy by the deceased student against the Islamic religion through a social media group. The students, in mob outrage, had traced the female student, killing her and burning her corpse at the school\u2019s security gate after overpowering the college security personnel.\n\nIn a move to avert a major religious crisis over the killing of the female student, Tambuwal had, last weekend, declared a 24-hour curfew in Sokoto metropolis. The curfew came as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah, suspended all masses in Sokoto metropolis, but clarified that his residence was not attacked.\n\nThe curfew in Sokoto followed protests by some Islamic faithful that greeted the condemnation of the killing by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III.\n\nCAN had at the weekend called on all its members to embark on peaceful protests nationwide on May 22, 2022.\n\nThe remains of Deborah were laid to rest at the weekend in her home town, Tunga Magajiya, in Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nTambuwal Relaxes Curfew in Sokoto, Preaches Peace\n\nTambuwal, yesterday, relaxed the 24 hours curfew imposed on Sokoto metropolis as a result of protests by the irate Muslim youths in the state. In a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Isa Bajini Galadanchi, the governor said the relaxation of the restriction of movement was sequel to a briefing by the security chiefs in the state.\n\nTambuwal explained that the revised curfew would now be from dusk to dawn in Sokoto Township. This, he said, was to afford people the window to pursue their legitimate businesses and other means of livelihood.\n\nThe government, however, advised people to maintain peace, stressing that it would not condone any breach of law and order in the state\n\nIn a related development, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Sokoto State, debunked a video making the rounds in social media portraying one Anita Josephine Ogonna as a serving NYSC member caught in the web of unrest that engulfed Sokoto recently.\n\nA statement by NYSC\u2019s Public Relations Officer in the state, Sani Idris, said the video was untrue and the mere imagination of the initiators.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC management hereby states that the said video, which has gone virile, is baseless and designed by mischief makers to create fear in the minds of corps members, parents, and, indeed, the general public,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIdris further said while the NYSC management sympathised with those affected by the unfortunate incident in the state, those captured in the said video were not Sokoto corps members. He urged the general public to disregard the video in circulation.\n\nThe NYSC spokesman disclosed that the security and welfare of corps members remained a cardinal policy thrust of the scheme, adding that the NYSC management and Sokoto State, \u201cShall never shirk responsibility of ensuring that no corps member is harmed.\u201d\n\nDeborah: Don\u2019t Join Planned Protest, Gov Sule Tells Nasarawa CAN\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, yesterday, asked the state chapter of CAN not to join the planned protest by the Christian community in the country. Sule made the appeal in his opening remarks at the state\u2019s security meeting held at the Government House, Lafia.\n\nHe maintained that his appeal became necessary because of the fragile nature of the state and the fear that hoodlums might hijack the peaceful protest and throw the state into anarchy.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cI will like to appeal to our leaders to ensure that we don\u2019t join in this peaceful protest, especially, because of the fragile nature of our state. This is similar to what we have done also when doctors, teachers, ASUU, all in the past, wanted to go on strike, but we appealed to these bodies in the state not to join.\n\n\u201cThe reasons being that the nature of our own state is peculiar and different from some of these other states. And sometimes peaceful people, very good people, will actually begin to protest in one way but they lose control because some hoodlums will come in and hijack the protest.\u201d\n\nSule appealed to the leadership of CAN to allow the law take its course, especially as the federal and Sokoto State governments had already come into the matter and were taking action. He, therefore, assured that the murderers would not go unpunished.\n\nDescribing the killing of Deborah as unfortunate, the governor said his administration was taking steps to protect the people and ensure similar things did not happen in Nasarawa State.\n\nSouthern, Middle Belt Alliance Demands Prosecution of Perpetrators\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA), yesterday, called for accelerated prosecution of those involved in the murder of the late Deborah. SaMBA, in a statement signed by Prince Rwang Pam Jnr., said the killing of the student was not acceptable under any guise.\n\nThe group berated former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for what it called a \u201clevel of insensitivity not fitting for a president.\u201d\n\nIt added that Atiku portrayed an ugly weakness now that Nigerians were unanimous in the search for a competent Commander- in-Chief.\n\nSaMBA regretted that the victim was another youth, who could, perhaps, have voted Atiku in the next election, if she was alive.\n\nAtiku was alleged to have condemned the killing in a tweet, only to delete it after the fanatics threatened to withdraw their votes for him in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nSaMBA appealed to the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) to, as matter of urgency, sensitise Muslims across the country to the fact that killing in the name of God was against Islam, as Islam was synonymous with peace.\n\nSaMBA said in the statement, \u201cIt is very pathetic that Samuel Deborah, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State, was stoned to death and set ablaze on Thursday by her fellow students for allegedly making a blasphemous statement on a WhatsApp group.\n\n\u201cThe act by her fellow students is condemnable in its entirety and we call on security agencies to ensure that all those involved in the killing of Deborah Samuel face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe case must not be swept under the carpet if we want to bring an end to killings in the name of religion.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to say that all those involved in the killing of Deborah Samuel are potential bandits and Boko-haram members.\u201d\n\nSaMBA added, \u201cThe former vice president has cleared all doubts about his desperation for power and his proclivity to religious fundamentalism, even though he might have made strenuous attempts over the years to hide his bigotry.\n\n\u201cAtiku\u2019s action sends dangerous signals about the kind of president he would be if Nigerians make the mistake of electing him as our Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\u201cHe has shown that the blood of innocent people, no matter where they come from, does not matter to him.\n\n\u201cHe has shown that he can shield lawbreakers and murderers to protect and preserve his political interest.\n\n\u201cAtiku has portrayed a most disgusting weakness, especially at a time when Nigerians are looking for a competent Commander-in-Chief that can take the war to terrorists.\n\n\u201cFor him, political correctness is more important than national correctness, and this is dangerous.\u201d\n\nCalling on Nigerians to elect a president from southern Nigeria, SaMBA stated, \u201cA president of the South-east extraction will heal our nation of such bigotry and build a Nigeria where every section and religion can co-habit harmoniously.\u201d\n\nDickson Condemns Deborah\u2019s Killing, Urges Nigerians to Unite against Extremism\n\nThe senator for Bayelsa West, and immediate past governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, called on Nigerians in positions of authority to condemn in the strongest terms possible the grisly murder of Deborah by extremists. Dickson also urged all politicians aspiring to lead the country in various capacities to condemn the reprehensible killing of the student.\n\nThe former governor commended the Sultan of Sokoto and Sheik Ahmad Gumi for promptly condemning the unfortunate incident. He also welcomed the proactive measures put in place by Tambuwal to ensure peace and order in the state.\n\nThe senator commended Bishop Kukah and other Christians for their role in preventing reprisal actions.\n\nDickson, who condole with the family of the late Deborah, said a country where people took laws into their hands to carry out such barbaric act was not what Nigerians deserved. He said those involved in the heinous act should be made to face justice, as their action violated the laws of the land.\n\nHe urged Nigerians of all religions to condemn extremism and take a united position against it.\n\nDickson stated, \u201cI condemn the brutality of the unacceptable act which is clearly a violation of the laws of Nigeria. I also call for the authorities to take appropriate action and all those who are in authority and leadership to join in condemning this barbaric act.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be the Nigeria that we seek, we deserve better than this. I call on Nigerians to respect the religious sensibilities of each other and they should unite against extremism in all religions, as we are a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nation.\u201d\n\nEx-SGF, Babachir Lawal, Denies Urging Christians to Avenge Deborah\u2019s Murder\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, denied reports that he was instigating Christians in the country to avenge the killing of Deborah Yakubu, a Christian student, in Sokoto by Muslim fanatics.\n\nLawal said in a statement on Monday, \u201cThere is a voice note being circulated in the social media purported to have been made by me inciting Christians to retaliate the recurring violence repeatedly unleashed on Christian individuals, their communities, and their properties as epitomised by the recent burning to death of Miss Deborah Samuel and church property in Sokoto.\n\n\u201cWhile I rightly feel indignant about these killings, it is not in my character to incite people to retaliate.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF added, \u201cBesides, the voice on the voice note is not mine neither is it in my character to incite revenge,\u201d and the Bible \u201cclearly urges believers to leave vengeance to God.\u201d\n\nLawal explained that he had always urged all \u201cvictims of religious bigotry and violence to obey this injunction.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cI am particularly heartened that the parents of Deborah Samuel have chosen this path. For those whose interest is best served by this wicked and cowardly act of trying to sully my name, I wish them well. But, certainly, it was not done by me, neither did I say such. Certainly, the voice is not mine, the sentiment is not mine, and the grammar is not mine.\u201d\n\nLawal urged \u201call my friends and family to ignore this malicious act.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that he was prepared for court action against those trying to tarnish his image and name through the spurious voice note, \u201cand they will be made to have their day in court.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Our four years is always four years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have, at a point called the ASUU national chairman, and we made our position known concerning joining ASUU strikes.\n\n\u201cWe want to inform university students, stakeholders, and the general public that UniOsun has no plan to join the strike.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Safaricom, the largest telecommunications provider in Kenya, is set to launch commercial operations in Ethiopia later this year. This announcement was made by Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa while sharing the telco\u2019s financial statement for the year ended March 31, 2022 last week.\n\n\u201cWe have made our first test call, sent [the] first test SMS and completed [the] first test data session,\u201d Ndegwa said on Twitter. \u201cWe have a strong team of 300 employees with half of them being Ethiopians.\u201d\n\nA key highlight from the results announcement is that we are set to launch commercial operations in @SafaricomET within the year as part of our regional expansion efforts to provide world-class telecommunication services to over 112 million Ethiopians. #SafaricomFYResults pic.twitter.com/oJPgGSVJfw \u2014 Peter Ndegwa (@PeterNdegwa_) May 12, 2022\n\nSafaricom increased its service revenue by 12.3% to KES 281.11 billion ($2.42 billion) and profit by 13.5% to KES 109.13 billion ($940 million), according to its latest financial report. Voice service revenue grew by 0.8% to KES 83.21 billion ($720 million); mobile data revenue grew by 8.1% to KES 48.44 billion ($420 million), while M-PESA revenue grew by 30.3% to KES 107.69 billion ($930 million).\n\nSafaricom Ethiopia\u2019s plans to bring mobile financial services to Ethiopia. However, this is subject to the licensing and regulatory process by the Government of Ethiopia.\n\nLast year, Safaricom joined efforts with Vodafone, Vodacom, Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Corp, and UK\u2019s CDC Group to secure the licence to operate in Ethiopia at a cost of $850 million, a landmark win as the second most populous African country opened up its telecom sector to competition.\n\nThis led Safaricom to set up shop in Ethiopia earlier this year, but while the licence allowed the company to compete against state monopoly Ethio Telecom, it couldn\u2019t offer M-PESA services (its mobile financial service) due to legal limitations.\n\nIn April, Ethiopia started changing its national payments law to enable Safaricom to introduce M-PESA in the country.\n\nAccording to Business Daily Africa, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) drafted a new bill which included a clause that \u201cForeign nationals may be allowed to invest in a payment instrument issuer or a payment system operator business, or establish a subsidiary which shall be licensed as a payment instrument issuer or payment system operator.\u201d\n\nWhen the new bill is signed into law, Safaricom will be able to compete with Telebirr, a mobile service Ethio Telecom launched last year that attracted 4 million users within its first month. Ethio Telecom has over 58 million subscribers, the highest number of subscribers by an African operator in a country.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian mobility company, GIG Mobility has announced a new leadership team with Enahoro Okhae as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nJoining Okhae are Jude Odum as Chief Operating Officer, Funmi Ogunleye as Chief Process Officer, John Okafor as Chief Procurement Officer, Chukwudi Anyawuocha as Chief Enterprise Business Officer, and Kenneth Nwanganga as Chief Technology Officer.\n\nOkhae brings over a decade of experience working with various businesses in different capacities and is the president of the Life Coaches Association of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnahoro Okhae, CEO, GIG Mobility\n\nFollowing the announcement, Chidi Ajaere, CEO of Greatman Legend (formerly GIG Group), said, in a statement, \u201cI believe that GIGM is ready to move on from its founders. Engaging in actionable steps to strengthen our goal to provide innovative and disruptive products as well as build an empowered and efficient workforce is something we are committed to at GIGM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEnahoro brings unquantifiable experience to this role and will drive value for all stakeholders through his leadership and initiatives. I am delighted that we were able to get him to embrace the long-term vision of GIGM as he takes on this new role.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okhae hinted at GIGM embedding more customer-friendly features in its products. \u201cTechnology has been pivotal in positioning GIGM as an industry leader, and technology will be the premise on which the company will continue to lead the industry.\n\n\u201cThe digital age is primarily characterised by customer-first features with crucial attention paid to customised services. This new dispensation will focus on implementing future-proof business strategies while integrating more lifestyle features into the GIGM application enabling users to do things freely while moving freely.\u201d\n\nBuilding a sustainable business\n\nOver the past few years, GIGM has steadily incorporated technology into its operations, transitioning from a transportation company to a tech-driven mobility player. In 2019, it launched its services in Ghana as part of moves to become a pan-African player.\n\nThat was followed by the addition of payment services in 2021 as the company revealed its desire to facilitate the movement of not just humans and goods but also value.\n\nCommenting on GIGM\u2019s mobility goals, Okhae shared that the company plans to embed more lifestyle features in its products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMobility is beyond movement; it is about the ability to move easily and unhindered irrespective of the channel: land, rail, water, air, or virtual/augmented reality. While moving freely, people should also be able to move things freely. This is the new renaissance of GIGM and the bedrock upon which we will embed more lifestyle features in the existing customer app.\u201d\n\nWith the new leadership not including anyone from the company\u2019s founding team, it would be interesting to watch the business\u2019 attempts to stay relevant in the face of stiff competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Techpoint Pitch Friday.\n\nOn Friday, May 13, 2022, we had two entrepreneurs share their startups and their journeys with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to start by 5 pm, we eventually began by 5:15 pm when one of the founders scheduled to pitch was held up by traffic. However, we kicked off with Peter Ayeni pitching Strich.\n\nA one-stop-shop for managing business operations\n\nOver 80% of Nigerians depend on mom and pop shops for their household supplies. Unfortunately, many of these shops struggle to track their finances and inventory, leading to avoidable losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Ayeni, CEO Strich\n\nStrich wants to eliminate these challenges for the businesses and help them grow their operations. Already, the startup has gotten support from Adanian Labs and is in the process of raising a pre-seed round.\n\nMaking life easy for laundry merchants\n\nWhen people decide to start businesses, they rarely anticipate the operational challenges that will often take them away from doing the main tasks their businesses should be doing.\n\nFor laundry merchants, they have to market their services to customers, but they also have to track and fulfil orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAyo Popoola responding to questions about Ricive\n\nPreviously, all this had to be done manually, but Ayo Popoola wants to digitise these operations with Ricive.\n\nFeedback and networking\n\nAfter the founders were done pitching, they were peppered with questions on everything from their business model to traction and differentiating factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 6:30 pm, the event was brought to an end, and participants lingered to network.\n\nThe next edition of Pitch Friday comes up Friday, June 11, 2022, and it promises to be an exciting time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRemember Elon Musk saying his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter was \u201ctemporarily on hold\u201d due to spam concerns on Friday, May 13, 2022?\n\nSo, Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal responded yesterday, Monday, May 16, 2022, claiming Musk\u2019s plan to quantify the problem by randomly sampling 100 accounts would fail.\n\nThe Twitter-Musk drama that we thought was almost over appears to be just getting started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what do you think this is all about? Is it true that he probably won\u2019t buy Twitter and finding ways to avoid paying the $1 billion fine, as some claim? Or do you believe he is genuinely concerned? If you\u2019re indifferent, please let me know too.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhy some people in tech fake it until they make it\n\nTopship\u2019s $2.5m seed\n\nTwiga Foods launching Twiga Fresh\n\nWhy do people in tech fake it \u2019till they make it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you listened to the latest episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast? If you haven\u2019t already, you should. It is always published before the newsletter.\n\nI laughed a lot while listening to today\u2019s episode; it is quite entertaining. My favourite story is probably, \u201cFake it till you make it.\u201d\n\nBefore we proceed, what do you think about the adage? Anyway, while listening, one question that kept popping into my head was, \u201cDoes doing that make you a bad person?\u201d\n\nI mean, humans need to achieve their goals one way or another, and if it means faking it until they reach it, what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nHmm. Before you come for my head, let me unequivocally state that I do not support living a fabricated life on or off social media.\n\nHowever, based on the definition of the adage, you may agree with me that humans may need to fake it before they make it at times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what exactly does the adage mean? \u201cFake it until you make it\u201d implies that you can imbue your life with confidence, competence, or an optimistic outlook by imitating those qualities.\n\nAnd we all know that appearances are significant if you want to be appropriately addressed. Well, except you look like a baby like me. \ud83d\ude02 And, as we all know, babies don\u2019t care. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 Okay, I\u2019m kidding.\n\nHowever, you will agree that wearing high-quality or nice clothing and accessories boosts confidence. Still, I have a problem with the adage, especially when people try to convince us that they\u2019re doing something they\u2019re not on social media.\n\nThis happens all the time, and it isn\u2019t any different in the tech industry. Why will some tech bros and sis claim to be doing something they are not? To what purpose?\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure why some people in the tech industry want to literally fake it until they make it \u2014 assuming they make it at all.\n\nBack to the podcast, Oluwanifemi spoke with two experts from The Experts series concerning this, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to hear their perspectives, and the editorial\u2019s too. You can listen here.\n\nTopship\u2019s $2.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed closely, you\u2019d have noticed that after the publication of our Y Combinator report, Emmanuel answered the question, \u201cwhat problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s news is about a startup attempting to solve one of the problems named Topship. If you don\u2019t know what the company does, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nTopship is a Nigerian digital freight forwarder that recently completed the YC winter batch. It was founded in 2020 after Co-founder and CEO, Moses Enenwali, noticed an increase in merchants\u2019 needs for shipping parcels and cargo outside of Nigeria.\n\nAnd yesterday, Monday, May 16, 2022, the company announced that it has raised a $2.5 million seed round to assist merchants with international shipping.\n\nThe round was led by Flexport. Other participants include Y Combinator, Soma Capital, Starling Ventures, Olive Tree Capital, Capital X and True Capital, while some of the individual investors in the round include Immad Akhund, Mercury CEO and Arash Ferdowsi, Co-founder of Dropbox.\n\nTopship wants to make shipping as simple as possible for African businesses to export and import parcels and cargo to their customers, suppliers, and distributors worldwide.\n\nThe company says it enables 1,500 merchants to ship cargo and parcels from Nigeria to over 150 countries.\n\nAlthough it can assist Nigerian merchants in receiving parcel deliveries from other countries, it can only accept cargo deliveries from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China.\n\nThe new funding provides Topship with sufficient funds to proceed and begin operations in Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya. Also, a portion of the investment would go toward improving its asset-light technology and developing a proprietary global shipping infrastructure to make imports and exports much faster and easier.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in four days!

Twiga Foods has used technology since its inception to connect smallholder farmers with informal traders. This has given producers access to new markets and a large pool of customers while also optimising the food supply chain in its markets.\n\nHowever, Twiga claims that along the way, they have encountered traceability issues, stock-outs, and price volatility, making it difficult for the company to deliver on its promise of affordability and food security.\n\nConsequently, Twiga believes Twiga Fresh can improve production control.\n\nThe company claims that the investment in Kenya will result in one of Africa\u2019s largest single horticultural farms focused solely on the domestic market.\n\nFurther, Twiga Foods plans to start operations in Uganda and Tanzania soon and is also looking into new markets in Central and West Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmber Group, the leading global digital asset platform, today announced its entry into the metaverse with the launch of Openverse, a Web3 enablement platform for creators, brands and businesses. A culmination of Amber Group\u2019s multi-disciplinary expertise in digital architecture and blockchain-native infrastructure, Openverse serves as a gateway to the metaverse, empowering Web2 creators, brands and businesses with tools and services to transition into Web3.\n\nWith the metaverse economy projected to reach $13 trillion by 2030, Openverse marks Amber Group\u2019s venture into Web3 community building. Due to launch in Q3 2022, Openverse is a significant milestone in Amber Group\u2019s plans to aid businesses, industries and societies as they transition into Web3. As a one-stop platform, Openverse will create entry points into the metaverse by delivering end-to-end creative and digital infrastructures for creators, brands and businesses.\n\n\u201cDigital assets are the first step in realizing a decentralized future where people are empowered to create and connect with online communities, unlocking new digital experiences. While there has been a lot of interest in the metaverse, it remains largely conceptual. With Openverse, we are taking a solid step towards creating this digital reality for all. Backed by our expertise and partnerships within the digital asset ecosystem, Openverse is at the forefront of onboarding businesses and communities into the metaverse, unlocking the true potential of decentralization,\u201d said Amber Group\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Michael Wu.\n\nOpenverse is designed to be a Web3 enablement platform, supported by leading real-time 3D rendering technology to create an experiential digital world for all users. The platform will be accessible on mobile, desktop and VR platforms, and will come equipped with features such as real-time content interaction, gameplay, customizable digital avatars and an NFT valuation system. Openverse will also leverage Amber Group\u2019s flagship digital asset platform, WhaleFin, for its crypto financial services, creating synergies with the company\u2019s thriving consumer business line to expand the reach of its digital asset services.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to launch Openverse, and convert the possibilities of the metaverse into reality in the next few months. As we develop a gateway for everyone to journey into the metaverse together, we are also building a strong line-up of partnerships with gaming studios, sporting brands, digital artists and creators in an effort to bridge the gap between physical and virtual economies. Not only will this encourage more Web2 users to migrate into the metaverse, it will also herald a new era for digital assets worldwide,\u201d said Openverse\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jo Xu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "I\u2019ve always insisted that both actions and inactions will always have consequences, no matter how long it may take them to materialise. There are times when the repercussions take so long, one could be forgiven for believing one had gotten away with it. But we never really do.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of my early boarding school days in the UK when I would go home with school reports, which I knew would do nothing to endear me to my parents. Till this day, I blush when I remember my headmaster, Mr McDonald\u2019s remark to sum up one of my reports. To put it in his exact words, he said, \u201cDapo seems to think the whole school is one big playground.\u201d Chai! I knew the consequences of that. Did this oyinbo man not know how such a comment would sound to a Nigerian parent? I was in big trouble.\n\nTo adopt a nonchalant attitude to the infractions of our leaders and people around us, because it doesn\u2019t affect us in the immediate, is nothing short of foolishness\u2026\n\nNow, if my dad was the type of person whose nature it was to thrash out matters that don\u2019t sit well with him instantly, that would have been good. Unfortunately for us, he was not. After handing him my report at a time when I believed the joy of seeing his son for the first time in almost two months meant he would sheath his sword for a while, I would then proceed to reading his body language on a daily basis to gauge if he has read the report. A whole week would pass and my dad\u2019s countenance would give nothing away. Just as I begin to convince myself that I had gotten away with it, he would pounce. He caught me off my guard every single time. I never escaped the consequences of my actions.\n\nAs a people, we have over the years perfected the art of turning the other way, in the presence of very obvious infractions by our leaders; adopting a conspiracy of silence with the hope that when it\u2019s our \u201cturn,\u201d others will do the same and not \u201cpour sand in our garri.\u201d We carry on with the less than wise attitude of \u201cwhat\u2019s my own, if it doesn\u2019t affect me directly? Let me just maintain my lane.\u201d I believe that\u2019s the current parlance.\n\nThe frightening global warming situation the world finds itself in, only affirms my position that we cannot escape the consequences of our actions; one day, as sure as it is that the sun will rise in the morning and set at dusk, the proverbial hen will one day come home to roost.\n\nBringing it local, the recent Coronavirus pandemic has exposed our country to no end. The inadequacies of government hospitals and the public health care system in general is obvious for all to see. Stories of those who lost their lives to Covid-19 because of our lack of preparation for possible eventualities are heart breaking.\n\nThere\u2019s one glaring thing this tragic period should teach us however and it\u2019s this. Failure to do the right things at the right time will almost certainly result in unpleasant consequences. That\u2019s not the end of it though. Failure of those standing by to insist on the right thing being done when it should be done, will produce adverse results, not just for everybody else, but for you too. To adopt a nonchalant attitude to the infractions of our leaders and people around us, because it doesn\u2019t affect us in the immediate, is nothing short of foolishness because a day will come when we will all pay for it.\n\nTime has shown that whatever we do now will still catch up with us in the future just as surely as what we did or omitted to do in the past is haunting us right now. There is no better time for us to teach our children the way that they should go. There is no better time than now to ingrain in their psyche a society-focused attitude rather than a self-focused one, because as the dreaded Covid-19 has clearly shown us, there may come a time when neither money nor privilege will save us; despite our almost absolute faith in them.\n\nThe majority of us find it difficult to see any need in investing precious time and resources in inculcating these values in our children. We attach scant importance to getting our children to read material that will teach valuable lessons and positively shape their minds, and we certainly don\u2019t see the need to involve them in activities that will help them to learn these things experientially. Instead, we invest only in the things we believe will help them to \u201cget ahead.\u201d Things, we believe will put them at an advantage over their peers; and even if it so happens to give them an unfair advantage, well, that\u2019s the name of the game. Someone must lose just as someone must win. There\u2019s nothing like a \u201cwin, win\u201d situation.\n\nI find this prevalent attitude of \u201clet our society take care of itself and let me take care of me,\u201d not only to be myopic, especially when the same society makes it so difficult for you to enjoy in peace what you may have gained by \u201cgetting ahead,\u201d but also defeatist.\n\nRead also: Parenting in the world of social media and vanity\n\nRegarding the myopia, I don\u2019t believe it to be a coincidence that in the last few years, those who have abandoned the ship called Nigeria to seek greener pastures abroad, have increasingly included those who by all means of measurement would be regarded as prosperous. In a number of cases, the man may stay in Nigeria to continue his hustle while he spirits his wife and children to a country that functions better as a society, and affords them all more peace of mind. So, for us to think all that\u2019s required we do, is to help our children \u201cget ahead\u201d while failing to stimulate in them a desire to evolve a better society, the more fool we.\n\nConcerning yourself with only what will \u201cget you or yours ahead\u201d is also defeatist. Why? Because it clearly indicates that one has given up on one\u2019s country. As far as you\u2019re concerned, it can\u2019t change. It can\u2019t be better than it is, so what\u2019s the point in trying. Why not just yield to the appealing notion of \u201cjoining them if you can\u2019t defeat them\u201d? A much easier option and certainly a more expedient one. But a wise man once said, \u201ca soft people will vote for those who promised a soft way out, when in truth there is none.\u201d There is indeed no substitute to a character.\n\nTo quote from my book, Shifting Anchors, \u201cEvery parent owes the nation a duty to bring his or her child up well, by inculcating them with the right values. We Yoruba will call such a child, \u201cOmoluabi\u201d (and I believe \u201cEzigbonwa\u201d in Igbo. I\u2019m yet to get the Hausa equivalent. Maybe someone can reach out to help me with this). Once you abdicate this responsibility, you lose the moral right to complain about the state of the nation because when your child grows up, his behaviour will only compound the problem. It behoves you to do your bit. But first, you must lead in the way you would want to be led.\u201d\n\nWilliam Wordsworth\u2019s genius was put beyond doubt when he reminded us that indeed, \u201cchild is the father of man.\u201d\n\nChanging the nation\u2026one child at a time.",

          "title": "The obsession of men and economic repercussions",
          "text": "It was Lord Acton, a British historian who drew the attention of the world to an observation that a person\u2019s sense of morality decreases as his or her power increases. With the passage of time, we have heard the philosophical expression that \u201cPower tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d\n\nIn other words, having power corrupts a man, or lessens his morality, and the more power a man has, the more corrupted he would become. It is regrettable that most times, those in power do not have the people\u2019s best interests at heart.\n\nYet, people \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 love power. We talk about national power in international relations. Individuals are not left out in the power game. Individuals may seek power over others due to fear or mistrust which is a motivation for adopting coercive and antisocial modes of survival. Most men like power more than they would naturally admit. Why is it so? Most men are obsessed with power because it offers them freedom and unrestricted access to government resources. Often, we observe that power gives freedom to dominate and oppress the less privileged.\n\nWhile sanctions are imposed on Russia by the international community to asphyxiate the country\u2019s economy, countries imposing the punishments are at a risk of paying the price for their actions\n\nA police officer is given great power to enforce the law, but often they use the power to hurt others. When a police officer commits offense against humanity, there may not be punishment for his/her actions. We are not only referring to the defunct Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS). But there is always a repercussion when men in power are obsessed with power.\n\nToday, at the global level, we have seen that the obsession of one man is making Ukraine pay heavily for an invasion perpetrated by Russia. As cities are being razed in Ukraine, seaports are being bombed, civilians face humanitarian crisis and the country may not know peace again for many years. The man behind this onslaught is Russia\u2019s President. He has caused pain for hundreds of millions of people globally, particularly in Africa who think they have no stake in the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\nWhile sanctions are imposed on Russia by the international community to asphyxiate the country\u2019s economy, countries imposing the punishments are at a risk of paying the price for their actions.\n\nAlready, car owners across the globe are facing higher gasoline prices because of restrictions on Moscow\u2019s oil exports. Aviation and shipping sectors in most parts of the world are facing challenging times. High costs of fuel can influence negatively the profitability paths of both shipping and aviation sectors.\n\nThe war in Ukraine that is barely three months old is exacerbating already soaring food costs occasioned partly by COVID-19 related supply chain challenges that have contributed to high levels of inflation globally. The war coupled with varying degrees of inflation in many countries is driving up the price of wheat globally. It has been predicted by experts that food prices will soar even more since Russia and Ukraine account for a third of the global wheat production. Russia\u2019s exports will be grossly affected by sanctions, and because much of Ukraine is a battlefield, its agricultural cycle will be disrupted.\n\nIn all honesty, Russia\u2019s actions is a display of unacceptable affront to the global order and it is predicted that it will have enormous repercussions in Ukraine and beyond. While disruptions to the price of wheat could send grocery prices rising for consumers in leading industrialized economies, disruptions to the food supply in poorer countries could become a matter of life and death. Sri Lanka and other economically weak nations can tell the story better \u2013 their economies have gone haywire.\n\nThe world as it is today is experiencing what experts call the \u201cglobalization of inflation.\u201d According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), inflation is more than doubled between March 2021 and March 2022. \u201cThe annual rate of inflation worldwide, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), accelerated to 9.2 percent in March 2022 up from 7.5 percent in February 2022, 6.8 percent in January 2022 and 6.4 percent in December 2021.\n\nI agree with experts who theorized that overall rise in inflation reflects the effects of the COVID-19 related lockdowns between 2020 and 2021. And more recently, increase in inflation globally has been driven by the surge in energy and food prices, especially since the war between Russia and Ukraine started. The conflict, experts believe has inflicted a major shock on commodity markets, disrupting global pattern of trade, production and consumption in ways that are likely to keep prices rising in the coming years.\n\nGlobally, experts have also expressed fears about reduction in growth and rising inflation in many countries including Nigeria. According to the Financial Times global inflation tracker, Nigeria\u2019s inflation is steadily rising while the GDP is slowly dropping between April 2021 and April 2022. In the last five years, we read that official inflation has increased cumulatively by about 93.88 percent. Regrettably, personal accounts of individuals and households show that inflation is much higher than official figures displayed in Nigeria.\n\nIn spite of global economic inflation, Nigerian minimum wage remains at N30,000/month. Nigerians, we were told \u201csurvive because they adapt\u201d. Adapt to poverty or inflation? Not sure! But it is difficult to predict how long Nigerians will adapt to inflation in the face of poverty. As the general public questions the veracity of data in Nigeria, unemployment, population, and debt of the country keep increasing. How do we manage and solve these problems? We need to have Nigerians in elected and appointed offices at the state and federal levels who are sincere and committed to the people and who understand how the world works.\n\nWe are aware that the 2023 political game has commenced and politicians are making moves to impress the people. We think this is an opportunity to remind those men and women who are interested in providing leadership that the rot the nation is facing today economically, politically and socially requires technocrats, not heavyweights.\n\nTo steer the ship of the nation towards development after the general elections in 2023 is not about grandstanding, money or popularity. Those politicians who are dolling out millions of naira to procure forms in order to occupy the Villa or government houses as the case may be, need to know that the forms they are buying is not an invitation to a tea party but signifies their intentions to save the soul of Nigeria.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor we were told acquired presidential aspiration form though by proxy. Nigerians who understand the mechanism of the CBN were strongly of the view that the governor of the apex bank should gently resign before dabbling into politics. The law doesn\u2019t allow a partisan CBN governor to superintend over the formulation of the nation\u2019s monetary policies. We learnt that the CBN governor has withdrawn his presidential bid. Thankfully, the \u201cgovernor of governors\u201d saved himself and the apex banking institution from embarrassment. His detractors will have fun but not heart attack.\n\nMany cabinet ministers have shown interest to either be state governors or president of the country. From the highest office in the country, hot orders have been dished to civil and public servants interested in partisan politics to quietly resign. Some have resigned while others have to confer with their constituencies before obeying the orders. But in Nigeria anything and everything is possible as powerful men do not follow the law; they are above the law. Anyway, Nigerians are waiting for serving government officials interested in partisan politics to resign immediately. Or jettison the idea of taking part in partisan politics while in office.\n\nThe presidency is so attractive and juicy that some political aspirants including some public officers in government have procured political party forms worth millions of naira in their bid to become president of the most populous black nation in the world. Nigerians need politicians with fresh ideas to lead them. But one wonders why many individuals who are part of the numerous economic challenges the nation is facing today want to remain perpetually in office to inherit insecurity occasioned by terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, communal warriors, oil thieves and sea pirates.\n\nThe economy of the nation is not shipshape as we have depreciated naira.\n\nRead also: Is the CBN Governor a public servant or political appointee? Does it even matter?\n\nThe foreign exchange reserve is depleting, we have not resolved high debt to revenue ratio. We have plummeting oil production, rising cost of diesel and aviation fuels. In addition to all these economic challenges, the country is being labelled the poverty capital of the world. One wonders why the number of out-of-school children keeps increasing. It is about 15 million children that are out of school while most public tertiary institutions in the country are on strike. Electricity power supply is epileptic. Yet, we were told by the highest office of government that \u201ccabals\u201d are frustrating reforms in Nigeria\u2019s power sector. What a shame? This writer did not know that Nigeria have \u201ccabals\u201d who are above the law.\n\nI agree with an eminent scholar who is of the view that in the brinkmanship of statecraft, there are no \u201cone-size-fits\u201d all remedies but always a combination of options which must put over 200 million peoples\u2019 wellbeing at the centre of every consideration. We need to continuously interrogate this fact in the emerging socio-economic and political scenarios of the Nigerian state. We need a country that works. A country that gives people irrespective of religion, region, ethnicity, language and other identities equal opportunities to thrive and give their best in return to their country.\n\nWe believe that the 2023 general elections will not worsen the nation\u2019s economic situation but will provide a president and cabinet members with the capacity to turn the economy around positively.\n\nAt the state level, we look forward to electing governors who are accessible to the people if permitted. Nigerians are tired of recycled politicians who were or are governors through manipulation of election results. So, we plead with political parties to give us responsible politicians who will provide leadership to the people.\n\nOverall, the electorate needs to be decisive in the forth coming elections in order to elect capable politicians, not politicians with empty promises who cannot pay salaries and pensions of workers.

          "title": "About Blitzscaling and Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs",
          "text": "One of the simple joys of life for me is being able to draw intellectual parallels between concepts that on the surface seem quite distant, but on closer inspection are actually very similar.\n\nThe study and understanding of psychology empowers me to do this and now you get to read about all my crazy ramblings. My hope is that someone somewhere finds meaning in these things and is able to find a way to apply the insight.\n\nThe first time I read about Blitzscaling, I was a young and broke communications associate who had no weekend plans and needed something, anything, to keep myself company till I was back again in the office for the new week. I\u2019d borrowed a 2016 Harvard Business Review magazine from the office library with the intent to return it, but I never did \u2013 sorry HR.\n\nAnyway, I found a very interesting interview between Reid Hoffman who is a Silicon Valley OG, and Tim Sullivan, former editorial director of Harvard Business Review Press.\n\nSo I\u2019m reading this interview about scaling really fast, Reid is explaining the essence of Blitzscaling, which is basically agility with calculated risks, and it made so much sense to me that I started drawing parallels from the conversation to the structure of a motivational theory called Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs.\n\nSimply put, Blitzscaling is the idea that to grow really big and very quickly, an organisation needs to take inventory of the impact of its brand and unique offerings, and use that in-depth understanding to go big on investing in elements that elevates its bottom line, which is ultimately \u2013 world domination.\n\nThere\u2019s essentially no rule book for Blitzscaling, it\u2019s a combination of street smarts and business management. To determine what Blitzscaling has to do with Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, we need to understand what the latter actually is.\n\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs is a motivational theory of psychology that structures human needs into five hierarchical steps. They range from more concrete needs such as food and security to abstract concepts such as love and belonging, esteem and self-actualization needs.\n\nMaslow believed that human motivation moves from the bottom of the pyramid to the top \u2013 you only stop to consider higher needs in the hierarchy when you feel you have sufficiently satisfied the previous need. It makes sense, right? How do you brainstorm on an empty stomach? No one thinks about taking over the world while they are being attacked \u2013 or do they?\n\nSince the dawn of time, through movies, music and books, we have heard stories about humans who have done incredible things in the face of hunger and or risk of personal danger. Think of iconic athletes like Jordan and Kobe (RIP) who will play through severe bodily injuries and still dominate.\n\nThink of soldiers who have had to remain brave and stay motivated to fight against enemies despite the possibility of death. Think of people who came from extreme hardship and poverty, who went on to become very successful members of society. In hacking productivity, I believe managing a concept as volatile as motivation, has to be more nuanced and contextual \u2013 especially as it relates to the very complex nature of human behaviour.\n\nPeers may have criticised Maslow\u2019s theory for not having external validation beyond the wealthy population he chose to base his studies on \u2013 but I will give him due respect for categorising the human needs and putting them in a hierarchy.\n\nWhat does Blitzscaling have to do with Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs? It\u2019s simple really \u2013 if you flip the pyramid on its head, this will put self-actualisation and esteem as primary needs, and everything else which is love and belonging, safety, and physiological needs become secondary.\n\nRead also: LCCI, RIMAN advocate risk management practices in organisations\n\nWhen you fuse the premise of Blitzscaling and a flipped Maslow Hierarchy of Needs, what you have is the ultimate cocktail of staggering success if applied with discipline and tact.\n\nRecall the scene in The Godfather II when Michael Corleone visited Havana in Cuba while seeking to expand his empire out there with the help of Miami mobster Hyman Roth, who did dealings with President Fulgencio Batista.\n\nAt the time, Batista\u2019s regime was under attack by guerillas of Fidel Castro, Michael was worried about how this would affect business, and he asked Roth if the guerillas were being paid to fight, Hyman responded that they were not and Michael was convinced that this meant they would win.\n\nIn my opinion, the concept of Blitzscaling is very much \u2018do or die\u2019, you either win big or you lose big. A person who grew up with nothing, or who is fighting to save their dreams, or whose need for greatness is bigger than their need to just exist, has nothing to lose if they try, but has everything to lose if they do not try.\n\nThis person does not fear hunger, danger, and is also not worried about losing friends or family. This person has a high locus of control, and also has incredible tunnel vision about the parts of their lives that needs to be amplified for success to be achieved. It may take time, but this person usually wins big in the end.",

          "title": "Africa needs infrastructure development for sustainable, inclusive growth",
          "text": "Economic growth has been slow in Africa following varied growth rates in three of Africa\u2019s largest economies \u2013 Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, according to the World Bank latest report. Africa\u2019s gross domestic product growth rate is estimated at 3.6 percent in 2022, representing a downward movement from 4 percent in 2021.\n\nOne of the factors slowing down Africa\u2019s economic growth rate is infrastructure deficiency. Adequate and quality infrastructure in all the African countries is critical for sustainable and inclusive growth in the continent.\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) estimated Africa\u2019s infrastructure financing needs to be as much as $170 billion a year by 2025, with an estimated gap of about $100 billion a year. The infrastructure gap challenge has aggravated the problems of unemployment, low productivity, and poverty in Africa.\n\nAccording to the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa, the road access rate in Africa is only 34 percent, compared with 50 percent in other parts of the developing world and transport costs are 100 percent higher. Only 30 percent of Africa\u2019s population has access to electricity, compared to 70-90 percent in other parts of the developing world. Water resources are underused with only 5 percent of agriculture under irrigation. The internet penetration rate is a mere 6 percent, compared to an average of 40 percent elsewhere in the developing world.\n\nThe insufficient stock of productive infrastructure in power, water, and transport services that allow firms to thrive in industries hinders industrialisation in Africa. Africa must industrialise to end poverty and generate employment for about 15 million young people who join its labour force every other year.\n\nInfrastructure deficiency is also hindering learning and human capital development in Africa. Many African higher institutions do not have modern infrastructural facilities to make learning attractive and easy. As a result, many African graduates do not have what it takes to compete effectively for available opportunities in the global labour market.\n\nInsufficient road infrastructure has posed a challenge to the movement of inputs to manufacturers and finished goods to consumers within and across African countries. The high cost of transportation has aggravated the cost of commodities in African markets.\n\nThe average cost of production in Africa is very high due to the low power supply. The majority of businesses depend on self-generated power sources to power their operations. The high costs of running and maintaining power-generating plants have resulted in inflation, unemployment, and low output in Africa.\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are more challenged by Africa\u2019s infrastructure deficiency. The majority of SMEs do not have enough capital to strive; as a result, they face proportionally higher supply chain barriers and costs.\n\nInfrastructure development is critical for Africa\u2019s sustainable and inclusive growth; adequate and quality infrastructure would facilitate increased intraregional and international trade, reduce the cost of doing business, promote human capital development and enhance Africa\u2019s competitiveness within and in the global economy.\n\nAdequate and quality infrastructure is essential for Africa to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, Agenda 2063 of the African Union, and the High Five Goals of the AfDB. Good infrastructure has the potential of impacting growth directly and indirectly for infrastructure entering the production system as direct input, which increases the productivity of enterprises.\n\nInfrastructure development must be prioritised in Africa to attract investors. Infrastructure development is a pre-condition for investment to strive in both developed and developing countries. In Africa, infrastructure must be addressed adequately to attract investors and reduce the problem of unemployment, poverty, and low growth.\n\nRead also: Sanwo-Olu, experts advocate increased funding of infrastructure in Africa\n\nThe total cost of bridging the infrastructure gap in Africa is very high; the governments and donors alone may not be able to meet the infrastructural needs of the continent. Private-public participation will as well help in the fight against infrastructure deficiency in Africa.\n\nInstitutions investors like banks, insurance companies, pension funds custodians, and administrators have more than $100 trillion in assets under their management globally. A small portion of the excess global savings would be enough to invest in productive and profitable infrastructure in Africa.\n\nAfrican governments must expand their revenue generation base and reduce the cost of governance to have enough reserve for infrastructure development. The African government must make good economic policies that promote infrastructure development.\n\nAfrica has the potential to boost the world economy. Africa has one of the largest markets in the world to promote the global economy. Africa\u2019s policymakers must strategise to close the infrastructure gap challenging Africa\u2019s growth and development to make the continent a viable location for foreign direct investment inflows, thereby reducing the problem of growing unemployment, low growth rate, and poverty in the continent.\n\nFelix Ashakah is an economics lecturer at Western Delta University, Oghara",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun State governorship aspirant under the political platform of Zenith Labour party (ZLP) in the July 16 election Engineer Olufemi Adesuyi has said he would transform a thousand youths into stable millionaires within a year of his administration through technology, if elected.\n\nAdesuyi who made this known during a press briefing on Monday in Osogbo said misplace of priority of the present government contributed to the poverty of the citizens in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the power now and we will transform the power into wealth. As somebody who is an IOT expert, I mean \u2018Internet Of A Thing\u2019, I can say if I\u2019m elected as governor of the state, within one year I will transform a thousand youths into stable millionaires through technology.\n\n\u201cWe will achieve this by creation of \u2018techno-preneurship, because in this world now there is no resource that would drive itself. Every resource relies on technology. In terms of Agriculture, it is very wrong for a government to think that a graduate will go to farm and pick up a cutlass and hoe. It is very difficult for graduate to acquire a tractor. So what do we do?\n\n\u201cWe have done our studies and we know that in other countries, there is something we call Power Tillers. It is affordable. A Power Tiller does not cost beyond 1.2-1.5 Million Naira. This can make you cultivate five hectares of land in a day. So if we want the youths to go into farming and we give them Power Tillers, they will be able to cultivate their own portion of farmland and still be of help to people around them.\n\n\u201cThis is affordable and convenient to a tractor of N30 million,\u201d Adesuyi said.\n\nHe added a monitoring committee will be set up which will see to the evaluations of the projects.\n\nAdesuyi berated the state overnment led by Governor Gboyega Oyetola, describing his performance as total total failure , saying the government has failed in its statutory responsibilities.\n\nAccording to him, the present administration in the state has failed in the area of education, security, workers welfarism, empowerment and employment, commerce and industry, Social welfare among others.\n\nAdesuyi attributed these to lack of innovative thinking on the part of people at the helms of affairs to misplaced of priority.\n\n\u201cThe previous administration gave us O Nonsense \u2013 O Agriculture, O Meal, O This that we never seen their effects on the local market. But they kept shouting on the media,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOsogbo and environs were known for Commerce, long before it become a capital city. And that was given a boost by the advent of railway station. Where is the Commerce today? They lack innovative thinking to resuscitate these industries which are capable of employing nothing less than 10,000 youths.\n\n\u201cAlso we have Ejigbo as an exchange port to Code Vua, especially abdjan. That has been in the news for sometimes now but it has never has an effect on the Osun economy because our government is not thinking about it.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to import and export goods to that country in order to strengthen our foreign exchange. Nothing was done. Osun is blessed.\u201d\n\nAdesuyi bemoaned the ruling APC government for celebrating payment of salary of workers as achievements saying, the government is not doing the workers any favour, rather should see it as statutory role to play.\n\nHe subsequently appealed to the Osun people to vote him as governor for his government if elected would turn the state to economic hub through technology.",

Across the three senatorial districts, our people have spoken loudly that Ademola is their preferred choice.\n\n\u201d Those who are surprised at Senator Adeleke\u2019s high level of acceptance must take note that his passion for service, his transparency and honesty, his accessibility to the high and the low and his people- oriented programmes and actions endear him to our people. Today is therefore a celebration of life of a true man of the people whose life symbolises service to humanity.\n\n\u201cOur best gift for this public spirited public figure is continuous mass mobilisation across town and villages of Osun state until victory is attained in July. We must continue to plan and strategize to end bad government in Osun state. We have an historic duty to return Osun government to the people and deploy the instrument of government to alleviate the pains and suffering of our people\u201d, Prof Oladipo noted.\n\n\u201cBy next year , we will celebrate the birthday of Senator Ademola Adeleke at the Government House by the special grace of God.

          "title": "The Age of Social Media: Friend or Foe?",
          "text": "Back in the day, finding out what happened to someone in another town or street took days, months, and sometimes even years. Tough, right? but now thanks to the explosion of technology, especially social media, information even about strangers in another continent is now available at the click of a button.\n\nToday\u2019s society fortunately and unfortunately is largely dependent on social media, not just for information gathering but for socialising, exploring, learning, bullying, intimidation, exposure and more. The advent and growth of social media originally started as a need to expand the human intellect, but slowly over time, it has grown into a sort of mini-god, ruling over everyday thoughts and judgements. While social media is generally about creating wholesome personal influences to immense extents, we are here to see if it\u2019s truly a friend or foe.\n\nFashion\n\nIt harnesses the power of aesthetics beyond borders. Fashion in any country has always been a fast-rising sector, where brands get to show off tailoring skills and contoured outfits. In fact, back in the day, many thought that owning a fashion line, especially in Africa, meant your family had a lot of money and often this was true, simply because fashion was termed a hobby and not an actual job. Parents fought tooth and nail with their children, encouraging them to become doctors, lawyers, pilots, etc. As technology advanced and style became more extroverted, social media has so far led a lot of new and old consumers to accept fashion trends quicker than before; from engaging cultural knowledge to body positivity and showcasing them, it has definitely soothed a lot of people\u2019s sense of style. And in some cases, the term \u201cmodesty\u201d is no longer in vogue. The older generation see social media as a friendly foe of sorts: friendly, because it allows a wider reach; foe, because clothing these days is suddenly barely even recognised as strips of clothing. It is now all about exposure, and quite a lot of it.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism has definitely seen an increase via consumption/patronage. Social media continues to play a weighty role in many areas such as the promotion of native tourism supervision, increasing local profits, regional development, aiding in local employment, advancing local governance, revamping social policies, cultural displays, etc.\n\nThanks to beautiful edits, consistent promotions and showcases, this has steadily, yet significantly, impacted the tourism system, by constantly engaging the roles and uses of social media by countries, by engaging travellers\u2019 decision making about where to visit, when to visit and how to take effective measures in protecting themselves\n\nAs great as social media has positively impacted tourism, it has also unavoidably shown the darker underbellies of countries which tend to promote themselves the most, such as human trafficking, enslavement, racism and so many more horrible aspects that nations/countries would rather keep away from the public eye, especially if that \u201cpublic\u201d is meant to aid in its growth and development.\n\nSocial media helps in tourism promotion and in focusing on best practices for interacting with consumers. Leveraging social media to market tourism products has proven to be an excellent strategy.\n\nInfluencing Influencers\n\nInfluencers, the new IT people of social media. From gathering like minded followers to promoting brands, lifestyle and everything in between, social media influencing has definitely become a big factor in long distance or close-range money-making efforts without necessarily working a nine-to-five shift with a corporation. As much as this sounds like such a positively friendly view, it also has its downsides, such as unrealistic showcasing, intimidation, unmerited lies and scandals in order to get to the top of the internet food chain, and adverse effects on psyches such as depression, suicidal thoughts etc. The list is endless, but the major one is living a fake life in order to impress strangers. Thanks to social media, gone are the days when people were simply accepted for who they were \u2013 for instance, their skin tone, etc.; now it is unrealistically glamorised so much so that there is a danger towards young minds treading dangerous paths in order to be recognised. This really doesn\u2019t sit well, especially with the older generation.\n\nInfluencing is a game changer but due to loopholes in rules, roles and accountability, so many negative attributes are starting to overshadow the positive nature of social media influencing, especially with regards to \u201cclout chasing.\u201d\n\nI must admit that the existence of social media has been a welcomed platform for sharing, learning, adapting and purchasing new movements, by bridging the gap between nations, brands and consumers, opinions and more simply by the click of a button, with about 80 percent of daily usage by citizens of the world, be it in a backwater country or highly civilised one; social media is now borderless and in control when it comes to decision making.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s hard to conclude whether it is a friend or foe simply because experience, usage, understanding etc., differ from person to person, yet one thing I can say is that guided usage is advised, because too much of anything can be bad. So, till there is a definite conclusion on how to feel or accept the terms of what social media should be, I would personally stick to a friendly foe: it drives you crazy but has its uses.",
          "summary": "but now thanks to the explosion of technology, especially social media, information even about strangers in another continent is now available at the click of a button.\nToday\u2019s society fortunately and unfortunately is largely dependent on social media, not just for information gathering but for socialising, exploring, learning, bullying, intimidation, exposure and more.\nWhile social media is generally about creating wholesome personal influences to immense extents, we are here to see if it\u2019s truly a friend or foe.\nThe older generation see social media as a friendly foe of sorts: friendly, because it allows a wider reach; foe, because clothing these days is suddenly barely even recognised as strips of clothing.\nSocial media helps in tourism promotion and in focusing on best practices for interacting with consumers.",

This is the kind of Nigeria that those of us in this political tendency to which l Sam Nda-Isaiah\u2019s belong, all attest to, and all believe.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, dedicate this award to the millions of Nigerians who believe in this new Nigeria and will retain faith in our possibilities as a people and are doing their best every day in their various corners to build this nation, through honest endeavor, I dedicated it to these people of goodwill who are working hard to promote peace and tolerance and to build a country that truly represents all of our dreams.\n\n\u201cA country those who are working hard to build bridges. Those who refuse to be frustrated or even weary by the trials of our country, as it grows and continues to the fullness of His manifest destiny.\n\n\u201cI think that it is because of such Nigeria, that despite the great challenges that we\u2019re passing on are a match of progress and I\u2019m certain that we will build this great Nigerian nation that we all yearn for.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I thank the management of Leadership for this award and I congratulate all awardees for the very well deserved recognition.

Gerrard was former captain of Liverpool.\n\nThe defeat for 15th-placed Southampton was an eighth in 11 games.\n\nKlopp bemoaned the scheduling of this must-win fixture due to it coming three days after the Reds\u2019 gruelling FA Cup final win over Chelsea.\n\nThe German opted for nine changes from that penalty kick shootout success, with goalkeeper Alisson Becker and defender Ibrahima Konate the only men retained.\n\nSadio Mane joined injured duo Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah in being given the night off.\n\nHis rejigged side enjoyed plenty of early possession but were rocked by Redmond\u2019s fine 13th-minute effort.\n\nAfter Lyanco dispossessed Diogo Jota just outside Saints\u2019 box, Redmond received the ball from Nathan Tella and ran almost half the length of the pitch.\n\nHe then cut in from the left and delightfully curled home from the edge of the area via a slight deflection off James Milner.\n\nKlopp felt the robust challenge on Jota was a foul and he had cause for further frustration minutes later.\n\nThis was when Roberto Firmino\u2019s precise headed finish from a Kostas Tsimikas free-kick was flagged for offside.\n\nChoruses of \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d rang out from sections of the home support.\n\nThis was in view of the fallout of Liverpool fans booing the national anthem at Wembley at the weekend before the visitors soon levelled.\n\nJapan international Minamino claimed the 27th-minute equaliser.\n\nHe beat recalled Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy at his near post with a powerful, rising drive into the roof of the net after being expertly slipped in by Jota.\n\nLiverpool were forced into a change at the break as captain Jordan Henderson replaced the injured Joe Gomez, pushing the versatile Milner to right-back.\n\nThe enforced alteration had little impact on the flow of the game and, after going close through Jota and Harvey Elliott, the visitors decisively edged ahead in the 67th minute.\n\nTsimikas\u2019 outswinging corner-kick from the left was inadvertently flicked on by Saints winger Mohamed Elyounoussi.\n\nMatip held off Walker-Peters to send a looping header beyond McCarthy and into the right corner in front of the delirious travelling fans.\n\nSouthampton rarely threatened a costly equaliser, although Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson fumbled a Redmond effort from distance late on.",

          "text": "Barring any last change of mind, ministers who backed down from their much touted political ambitions on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform may not return as members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nSimilarly, some others who just dropped their resignation following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive that they quit latest Monday (yesterday), may have also lost out to the party guidelines which gives 30 clear days for resignation before the party primaries.\n\nFollowing Buhari\u2019s directive, Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubaka Malami, SAN, Minister of Women Affairs Dame Paulen Tallen and Minister of State Petroleum Timpre Sylva, all made a U-turn on their various political ambitions.While Malami and Tallen were eyeing governorship and senatorial ambitions in Kebbi and Plateau states respectively, Ngige and Sylva aspired to be president, all on the APC platform.\n\nThe U-turn\n\nAt different times, the ministers said they were dropping their ambitions to continue in office, a decision Blueprint gathered, may not work out.\n\nA top presidency source told this medium that \u201cIt is all over for them after the president hosted all the ministers seeking one elective office or the other to a valedictory session. As at Friday, the president has said and declared there is no going back. The ministers are gone for good and won\u2019t continue in office.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, the president doesn\u2019t want to be seen as condoning impunity from cabinet members. It is surprising that they could announce their withdrawal from the race all because the president asked them to resign. The thinking out there was that they would contest for the various positions as sitting ministers. Neither the party\u2019s guideline nor the Electoral Act allows for that,\u201d said another source familiar with the development.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that \u201ca governor is already working on a replacement for his minister who is affected under this arrangement.\u201d\n\nOn 30-day notice of resignation\n\nOn the fate of Minister of Transport Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Godswill Akpabio, and Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology Ogbonnaya Onu who reigned their appointments after the presidential order, the party\u2019s guidelines may have shut them out.\n\nThey resigned about two weeks to the party primaries, a decision that clearly negates the party guidelines.\n\nSection 3(i) of the APC\u2019s guidelines for the conduct of primaries states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cAny political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave Office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\nParty sources told Blueprint that the clause as well as the controversial Section 84(12) of Electoral Act 2022 which also makes it mandatory for elective office seeker to resign 30 days before primaries, may have forced the aspirants to back out.\n\nOf the ministers with presidential aspiration, only Emeka Nwajiuba complied with both the party guidelines and provision of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe was said to have resigned 28th April, exactly 30 days to the May 28/30 date for the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nHowever, some of the appointees seeking elective offices did not beat the 30-day deadline but remained in their offices.\n\nElectoral Act 2022\n\nSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act has similar provision which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may wield to apply the sledge hammer on defaulting aspirants, depending on the outcome of the litigation which has crossed the appellate court and now awaits the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nTallen pushes on\n\nWhile AGF Malami withdrew Saturday from his governorship ambition without any reason, Tallen dumped her ambition to contest for the Plateau South Senatorial District of Plateau state Monday following the presidential directive.\n\nShe relied on the party\u2019s guidelines which gives 30 days to aspirants wishing to seek an elective office to resign their appointments.\n\nWomen groups and other stakeholders had purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms of the APC for the minister.\n\nIn a signed statement made available in Abuja Monday, Tallen stated that following the APC\u2019s guidelines, \u201cit will therefore be a breach to resign office at this time since this was not done ahead of the stipulated timeline.\u201d\n\nShe noted that \u201cNigeria is at a crucial point in history with women\u2019s participation at the lowest ebb with just 6.7% at the Parliament.\u201d\n\nThe minister said she was more committed to seeing a better picture with Nigeria taking its rightful place as the true giant of Africa, and therefore have taken an informed perspective to support more women across all political spheres at this time.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank and assure all my supporters that while their intention was well conceived, my current work in superintending the numerous projects for Mr President as Women affairs Minister require my undivided attention.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, whilst their quest is a good move in support of the clamour for more Women in elective and appointive positions, and considered to be critical in addressing the Gender question, I am compelled to focus on the foundations we have laid towards the advancement and realisation of gender equality in leadership positions in the country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI remain resolute as I continue to relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian Women in my capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR. Consequently, I wish to inform you all that following broad-based consultations and interventions from critical stakeholders, I have decided to withdraw from running for the senatorial seat mindful of our accomplishments and the notable progress we have recorded under my stewardship at the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.\n\n\u201cI have decided to voluntarily step down from the Senatorial race sequel to the yearnings of Women and other well meaning Nigerians who see the need for a strong voice for Women at the Senate having consulted widely with my family, well-wishers and supporters conscious of the role I play for Women in Nigeria today! So to all Nigerian Women and young girls who have raised concerns as to what next, rest assured that I, Dame Pauline K. Tallen, OFR, KSG have not submitted any resignation letter and therefore, it is my decision not to go ahead with this request but carry on as the Minister of Women Affairs,\u201d the minister further added.\n\nShe noted that \u201cNigeria has a long standing commitment in overcoming the challenges that inhibit Women from bringing about positive changes and the requisite impacts when given a place at the table of decision making, adding that her appointment as the Minister of Women Affairs is indicative of this progress and therefore she cannot lose sight of this opportunity.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cthe quest for gender equality and broadening access to enable Women to participate meaningfully in nation building, is at the heart of her desire to unlock the potentials of women to bring about positive change in the history of Nigeria, adding that the values upon which this success rests is most critical, if appreciable, progress is to be made in fulfilling our well conceived gender agenda.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our modest achievements, we are also conscious of the opportunities and achievements yet to be harnessed for Nigerian Women under this administration. As a humble servant of Nigerian Women, I am overwhelmed by the hard work, courage, patriotism and loyalty displayed by Women and I remain resolute to ride on these foundations to enable us build solid structures to yield strategic progress to add through our history.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Victor Adewumi stated this yesterday when he visited the site of the incident at Oku Iboku Community in Uyo, to assess the level of repair works on the instance of the Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar D.

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nThe Managing Director, First City Monument Bank FCMB, Yemisi Edun has described the Mastercard Foundation subsidized loans to 100,000 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises MSMEs as a purpose-driven intervention that would further help break the barriers that limit MSMEs\u2019 productivity and overall success in Nigeria.\n\nThe program, which is part of the Mastercard Foundation\u2019s Young Africa Works strategy in Nigeria, aims to sustainably move Nigerian youth out of poverty. It is being executed through a novel $27.8 million (about N15.5 billion) MSME Revitalization Fund, ensuring that qualified MSMEs can access loans for their business at a single-digit interest rate. Seventy percent of the MSME Revitalization Fund targets women-owned MSMEs in agribusiness, the creative industry, and digital sector.

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nAssociation of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has developed a roadmap campaign plan needed to save the naira from further decline and enhance exchange rate stability.\n\nThe ABCON National Executive Council said the move to save the naira was agreed by the body at the conclusion of its meeting in Lagos, where it unveiled strategies for save the local currency, bridge the exchange rate gaps and curb volatility in the forex market.\n\nThe naira exchanges at N596 to dollar at the parallel market and N415.83 to dollar at the official market creating a rate gap of N180.17 per dollar.\n\nThe ABCON President, Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Gwadabe said there was urgent need to enhance dollar liquidity in the market and ensure stability of prices in the economy.\n\nThese steps, he said would save the local currency and economy from the impact of election spending that has kept inflation at double digits for a very long time.\n\nThe ABCON boss disclosed that the depreciation of the naira against global currencies was due to pressure from rising dollar demand without sufficient liquidity to meet the demands from retail end users, manufacturers and other key players in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe naira has consistently come under serious pressure due to dollar scarcity making it difficult for forex end users, manufacturers and key industry players to access dollar needed to meet their needs. ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market. The suggested the strengthening of over 4,500 BDCs to bring forex closer to the retail end users and boost market liquidity.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that with the establishment of world class healthcare facilities in Nigeria, the country was set to become a destination for medical tourism, in addition to reversing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nMohammed who spoke after a media tour of Duchess International Hospital in Lagos, said the world class healthcare facilities springing up in Nigeria will also curb medical tourism abroad, conserve foreign reserves and create jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here at the Duchess International Hospital. During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

It is possible, not likely but possible. That is enough,\u201d Klopp said.\n\n\u201cIt is our last home game of the season, the atmosphere will be outstanding, and we will try to use it.\n\n\u201cOf course it could happen. Football is a tricky game sometimes. The only chance we had tonight was to win. We did our job. We never give up.\u201d\n\nKlopp\u2019s side will be expected to do their part of the equation against Wolves, especially now their refreshed key players can return to the team.\n\nSadio Mane, Luis Diaz, Andrew Robertson, Thiago Alcantara and Trent Alexander-Arnold were among those left out against Southampton, while Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk were sidelined with injuries suffered at Wembley.\n\n\u201cI never had a group like this. They push each other constantly. In the end, it is absolutely outstanding and tonight is really special,\u201d Klopp said.\n\n\u201cWe would have had much more problems today if we\u2019d played the guys who played 120 minutes on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t worked out, it would have been 100 per cent my responsibility. Now it worked out and the boys should be really proud of that.\u201d\n\nHistory bid\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola said he planned to watch the game on television and if he tuned in, it would have made for frustrating viewing as Southampton squandered the lead.\n\nBut it was Riyad Mahrez\u2019s missed penalty in the final minutes of City\u2019s 2-2 draw at West Ham on Sunday which had given Liverpool renewed hope of catching the leaders.\n\nAnd the Reds, hoping to become the first English club to win all four major trophies in one season, will settle their bid for historyin the last two games of their incredible, marathon campaign.\n\nFirst, Liverpool will try to avoid a repeat of 2019, when they beat Wolves on the last day but were still pipped to the title by City.\n\nThen they head to Paris to face Real Madrid in the Champions League final on May 28.\n\nLiverpool were hit on the break when Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s side took the lead after 13 minutes.\n\nRedmond sprinted away down the left flank, cutting inside to the edge of the area and unleashed a fierce strike that took a deflection off James Milner as it flashed into the far corner.\n\nWith their title hopes in jeopardy, Liverpool showed the desire and character that inspired Klopp to label them \u201cmentality monsters\u201d.\n\nJapan forward Minamino made the most of a rare Premier League start with a brilliant equaliser in the 27th minute.\n\nJoe Gomez fizzed a pass into Jota and his perfectly weighted lay-off reached Minamino, who beat Alex McCarthy at the near post with a ferocious rising drive.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s relentless pressure was rewarded in the 67th minute.\n\nMatip and Kyle Walker-Peters challenged for Tsimikas\u2019s corner and the ball looped in over McCarthy, forcing City to keep the champagne on ice for now.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Director-General of the Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, has said she is standing with Governor Yahaya Bello in the race for the All Progressives Congress\u2019 presidential ticket because she has seen in him qualities of the kind of leader Nigeria needs at this point in time.\n\nAbiola-Costello, daughter of the winner of the 1993 presidential election, late Chief MKO Abiola, said she chose Governor Bello over all other South West aspirants because she had seen in him true commitment to the progress of the country.\n\nThe DG also reiterated that, with the ongoing work in the Campaign, she was very sure that her principal would be victorious at the primaries, notwithstanding the political stamina of some others in the race.\n\nShe said this on Monday while addressing journalists in Lagos ahead of the APC presidential primaries slated for May 30 and 31, in Abuja.\n\nAbiola-Costello, however, said Bello was a loyal and respectful person, who would carry everyone along after he emerges.\n\nOn economy, she noted that statistics from the World Bank on states accountability rating in Nigeria indicates that Kogi ranks top among other states in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis is a man who met a debt profile of about N135bn in Kogi when he assumed office in 2016, but has been able to reduce it to about N70bn. This is addition to his huge investments in education, agriculture, security and infrastructural developments. The World Bank accountability ranking of states in Nigeria evaluated Kogi as 2nd in 2017, 1st in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe draft report for 2021 shows that Kogi scored 100 per cent in all the areas and from indications, the state will maintain the first position in 2021, judging from the draft report that was released just yesterday.\n\n\u201cI am proud of GYB because of his development records in Kogi. This is a governor that is always looking for progress and the development of lives of his people.

          "text": "The Executive Chairman, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, has commended 20 top-performing taxpayers whose compliances to tax obligations helped the service surpass its N6 trillion tax collection target in 2021.\n\nNami, in a statement obtained on Monday, noted that the feat was made possible by the uncommon leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari, the active support of its supervisor, the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, the backing of the National Assembly and its leadership as well as the cooperation of all other stakeholders in the tax system.\n\nThe companies included the Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas (NLPG) Company Limited, Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mobil Producing Unlimited, Star Deep Water Petroleum Limited, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited, Chevron Nigeria Limited, Total E& P Nigeria Limited, Airtel Networks Limited, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc, and Dangote Cement.\n\nOthers were Nigerian Breweries Plc, Total Upstream Nigeria Limited, Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited, Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited, British American Tobacco Marketing, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc and Lafarge Africa Plc.\n\n\u201cThe service also appreciates Northern Cables Processing and Manufacturing Limited (NOCACO) and Ikeja Electric Plc for being most improved in tax filing and VAT compliance respectively. We urge all taxpayers to join hands with the Federal Inland Revenue Service to make taxation the pivot of our nation\u2019s development and economic growth,\u201d Nami added.\n\nHowever, the acknowledgment came amidst controversies over specific remittances that had raised questions still begging for answers.\n\nTHISDAY had reported last Friday that MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, which was among the top taxpayers being celebrated, had claimed it remitted the sum of N618.7 billion in both direct and indirect taxes to FIRS in 2021, raising concerns in the public.\n\nNami, in the statement however, commended the contribution of the companies, noting that they defied the harsh global economic conditions imposed by the lingering COVID-19 pandemic to produce a heroic performance in tax payment, compliance and support.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe combined efforts of all taxpayers made it possible for the service to achieve the tax revenue collection of 2021 which provided our governments with necessary funds to meet their social contracts with the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe further highlighted their support and \u201cvery laudable performances in tax compliance, tax payment and timely responses to enquiries\u201d.\n\nMTN had in a statement on April 2, 2022, which was issued by the company\u2019s secretary, Uto Ukpanah, claimed that it paid the sum in direct and indirect taxes to the FIRS in the 2021 tax year, making it the largest single biggest contributor to taxes in Nigeria.\n\nThe company had added that its total tax contribution to all government agencies was 13.5 per cent of FIRS\u2019 total collection for the year.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, MTN Nigeria\u2019s total tax contribution to all government agencies including the FIRS amounted to N757.6 billion while FIRS collected a total of N6.4 trillion tax revenue in the year,\u201d the statement had stated.\n\nNonetheless, THISDAY calculations had revealed that the N618.7 billion tax payment as claimed by MTN represented less than 10 per cent of the N6.4 trillion that was reported as total collection by the service for the year in reference.\n\nHence, MTN\u2019s claim that it contributed 13 per cent of total FIRS collections of N6.4 trillion would mean it actually remitted N832 billion to the federal government in the period in question.\n\nFollowing the apparent discrepancy unraveled by the THISDAY checks, using MTN\u2019s prior statement, the former raised pertinent questions and sought clarification from both the apex revenue agency and the telecommunications company on why the final taxes was under-declared as it appears to be the case.\n\nRegrettably, the FIRS has declined to provide THISDAY with the specific amount paid by the company as taxes but said the figure churned out by MTN does not tally with its own account.\n\nYet, the onus falls on FIRS as a matter of transparency and confidence in the management of public accounts to make proper rendition to Nigerians.\n\nThe development particularly smacks of negligence on the part of the service and requires that both parties unravel the truth.\n\nSources confided in THISDAY that the refusal of both FIRS and MTN to do the needful contradicts the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) which among other things, forbids companies and agencies of the government from withholding critical information that is in the public interest.\n\nObservers also said the attitude of both companies serves to undermine the anti-corruption agenda of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSpecifically, Section 2, sub-section 4 of the FOI Act requires that \u201ca public institution shall ensure that information referred to in this section is widely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means, including print, electronic, and online sources, and at offices of such public institutions.\n\nAnalysts also said MTN Nigeria, as a corporate entity cannot afford to shy away from the principles of transparency and accountability in the interest of its shareholders and the public in general by detailing the various taxes it paid to the government within the year in question.",
