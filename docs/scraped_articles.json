          "text": ".\n\n\u2026calls for a united effort to fight insecurity\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ambassador to the Republic of Cameroon, Gabriel Olonisakin, has commended Nigerians living in Cameroon for their efforts in living in peace and being law-abiding.\n\nThe remark was contained in his speech delivered on the occasion of Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary celebration. The event which was held at Hilton Hotel, Yaounde, was attended by Dean and members of the Diplomatic Corp, senior government officials and other well-wishers across the world.\n\nOlonisakin expressed gratitude to the government of Cameroon, particularly the President, His Excellency, Paul Biya, describing him as a strong pillar of the good relationship between the two countries.\n\n.\n\n\u201cI commend you all for your hard work, good striving behaviour and above all, your law-abiding disposition. I must add that your individual and collective efforts, not only contributed to the economy of your host communities and country but also contributed to the economy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in several ways,\u201d he said.\n\nOlonisakin said Nigeria is facing its own unique challenges just like every other country in the world but assured that Buhari\u2019s government is working assiduously to ensure a safe and secure Nigeria that is essential for building a sustainable economy for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI assure you that the Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari is working to put an end to insecurity in Nigeria. He\u2019s working to ensure Nigeria remains a safe home for everybody outside the country. The results of these efforts are already manifesting in the several successes achieved against the Boko Haram insurgents and other criminalities in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe retired army chief also commended the efforts of the Nigeria-Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee collaboration held in Abuja recently, saying that it was a defining moment of collective effort.\n\n\u201cIt is important to appreciate the government and people of Cameroon for this collaboration which is aimed at ensuring collective peace and progress for our both countries.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSecurity issues continue to emerge, particularly on our continent, while threats to our growing democracies linger. However, we must be united in our condemnation of threats and protection of legitimate and democratic institutions of governance and leadership.\n\n\u201cEvery country, just like every individual, has a shared responsibility towards ensuring the health, peace and prosperity of our world. We have to join hands in overcoming the pandemic by making vaccines more available and equitable to all.\n\nDisputes, when they arise, as they are bound to, must be resolved amicably via dialogue and other peaceful conflict resolution mechanisms.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria High Commissioner also addressed the Nigerian community on the same occasion of Nigeria\u2019s national day celebration at a cock-tail event in Yaounde.\n\n\u201cOur National Day celebration always elicits great feelings both at home and particularly for those of us in the diaspora in all parts of the world. It is the day that underscores our resolve for national identity as Nigerians, irrespective of our ethnic, religious or other affiliations.\n\nIt is an indication that what binds us together, and the common aspiration we share is stronger than our diversity.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a beautifully diverse country and we must all rise up to lift the greatness in it. We are blessed to have the most important asset any nation requires for growth and development, which is human capital.\n\nIn his closing speech, the 56-year-old retired army officer saluted the influence of Nigerians in the diaspora, having frequently excelled in science, technology, medicine, sports, arts and many other fields.\n\nSimilarly, the creativity of ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Nigerian at home have resulted in globally recognized endeavours. Our country is indeed a nation to be proud of despite some arguments to the contrary by our detractors, who seek to amplify our artificially contrived fault-lines.\n\nWe must not allow the wishes of our detractors to define us and we must be resolved to stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder as Nigerians, whether at home or in the diaspora.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Davou Nyango, former Secretary of the Local Government in the wee hours of Monday 13, September, 2021, and has been detained since then.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Saturday in Jos, a text of which was made available to DAILY POST, the residents alleged that the military burgled the residence of Nyango, arrested and took him to their headquarters in Jos.\n\nChairman of Dakunji Concerned Citizens Forum, Mr Pam Logyang, while addressing the press conference revealed that sporadic shooting by the military left residents in the community in panic mood because they thought they were kidnappers.\n\nThey said: \u201cOn the midnight of September no13, the military without prior notice or warrant of arrest, went to the residence of Nyango who was a former transitional Secretary of Jos South, broke into his house and took him away.\n\n\u201cThe unholy act has caused Panic in our community, where innocent villagers are currently living in fear and many are terrified as a result of the nervous shocks they received from the invasion.\n\n\u201cThe military shot guns sporadically on air which led to heart attacks on many aged persons who are battling between life and death at the aftermath of the incident.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Chairman, Nyango has been detained for nine days without bail, adding that he was brutalised leading to the damage of his right eye.\n\nHe added that the incident has left both the victim and the community physically and emotionally traumatised.\n\nThey called on the military to repair Nyango\u2019s house and release him to go for medical attention as a result of injuries inflicted on him by the soldiers.\n\nThey called on the military command to stop the operatives of Safe Haven from invading their communities any longer, adding that if there were any issues, elders and stakeholders of the community were available for discussion.\n\nLogyang said the community has pledged to work cordially with the military, adding that all military actions must be in accordance to constitutional and military extant law.\n\nReacting, the Military Information Officer, Major Ishaku Takwa confirmed the arrest and detention of Mr Nyango but said he was never brutalised by the operatives as alleged.\n\nThe military said he has been released having not found culpable in the crime allegation against him.",

All these years, we were told that it would be fixed but it now seems like an eternity.\n\n\u201cLike me, I work in Ado and live in Akure and I ply the road every weekend. You can imagine the agony I go through every day. The trip used to be just 30 minutes drive but now it ranges between one hour 30 minutes to two hours depending on the weather.\n\n\u201cAlmost every month, we do see all these government officials inspecting but their actions have not shown anything meaningful.\u201d\n\nAnother road user living at Isinigbo emphasised that it was always a herculean task for residents of the community to make it to Akure and back.\n\nThe road user, Titilayo Ogendengbe, stressed that taxis always tried to avoid plying the axis because of the road while the few ones doing it increased the fare.\n\n\u201cFor us in this part of Akure North Local Government, we have resigned to our fate.\n\n\u201cTo me, it is a mystery that a road in the state capital would be left unattended to like this. This is an eyesore, to say the least,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t even believe that anytime Governor Fayemi wants to use the Akure Airport, he will take the Igbara-Odo, Igbara-Oke route to link Akure from Ado, a route that is much longer. They know that the road is gone.\n\n\u201cAnytime we want to go to town or come back home, it is always a huge concern. We just hope something is done fast, we are just tired.\u201d",

          "text": "From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha\n\nFor the umpteenth time, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has washed its hands off incessant killings in the Southeast.\n\nThe pro-Biafra group in a statement issued by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, condemned the unending unprovoked attacks.\n\n\u201cWe restate our belief in peaceful restoration of Biafra. IPOB has no hands in the senseless attacks going on in our territory. We are freedom seekers and we remain peaceful in our pursuit for freedom of Biafra,\u201d IPOB said.\n\nThe group, therefore, frowned at a statement credited to the former Ohanaeze Ndigbo President General, Chief John Nnia Nwodo, asking IPOB to stop killing their people, saying \u201cwe see this statement as that of a drowning man who wants to grab anything to stay afloat.\u201d\n\nIPOB asked Nwodo if he had investigated \u201cthose who attacked Ajali Police Station and confirmed they were IPOB? Has he also investigated who attacked the convoy of Hon. Chris Azubogu when he was coming back from Awka to Nnewi, where he dumped PDP for APC, and confirmed it was IPOB?\u201d\n\nThe group advised the former Ohanaeze PG to \u201ccaution politicians like him,\u201d than to be \u201cbusy chasing shadows and accusing IPOB.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Biafra Independence Movement (BIM) and Movement for Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) have called on the people of the Southeast \u201cto remain vigilant and resist the moves by the ruling All Progressives Congress-controlled Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari to allow insurgency overrun the country.\u201d\n\nBIM-MASSOB Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Elder Chris Mocha, in a statement issued in Onitsha yesterday, expressed worry that the Igbo are likely to be the worst hit in the event to Islamize Nigeria, particularly the Southeast because they are the major victims of the present Sharia laws being imposed in some states in the North.\n\n\u201cYou could recall that before now, some Northern Muslim leaders had been nursing the ambition of transforming Nigeria into an Islamic system of governance and their first daring indication was in 1986, when Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida as president, unilaterally registered the country into Organization of Islamic Countries, OIC,\u201d the group claimed.\n\nIt noted that the second daring indication to Islamize and fulanize the country was the refusal by the presidency to come out clean to name and shame the six Nigerians who were listed by the government of United Arab Emirates (UAE) as sponsors of terrorist organizations in the country, accusing the president of not being sincere in the fight against terrorism.\n\nThe group also appealed to the Akwa-Ibom State Commissioner of Police (CP), Mr Andrew Amiengheme to release Mr Akaidem Effiong Akpan, who had been reportedly detained in Ikot Akpanabia Divisional headquarters, Uyo, since May this year, for supporting Biafra\u2019s self-determination struggle.\n\nThe group said that the couple, a serving policeman and his wife, Mrs Blessing Akpan, are being punished because they were appreciating the untiring efforts and the non-violent methods of Chief Ralph Uwazuruike to achieve Biafra sovereignty through peaceful means.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nA landing jetty at Isaka in Okrika Local Government Area in Rivers State has collapsed, with about twenty passengers believed to have drowned.\n\nThe incident happened Saturday evening as passengers were struggling to board the boat from the community back to Port Harcourt\n\nAn eyewitness, who identified himself as Isaac Walter, said more than 70 passengers had queued to board a boat to Port Harcourt when the jetty caved in.\n\nIt was gathered that there was a big burial programme that attracted many people to the area and that the population had caused a rush for the boat.\n\nThe Sun has learned that over 80 people were on the jetty, causing pressure on the old, rickety facility.\n\nIt was further learnt that when the jetty caved in all the passengers on it fell into the river.\n\nMr Walter, a resident of the area who witnessed the incident, said that many persons have not been found since the accident.\n\n\u2018Today, we had a burial programme at Isaka and a lot of people were in attendance. On our way back, people came to board the vessel at the jetty.\n\n\u2018On that process, the jetty caved and so many people fell into the river and they were not able to be rescued. Few of them were rescued easily. I was standing a bit away from the point that caved in.\n\n\u2018The jetty is an old jetty. It was during Komo\u2019s period (as military administrator of the state) that they inaugurated that jetty. We have tried to get another jetty, but we could not.\n\n\u2018The people came on it, the pressure was on the jetty and then, it caved in. The people on the jetty at moment were more than 70. Local divers are still combing the area to find survivors. Though some were rescued.\n\n\u2018To be candid, I may not say exactly the number of people that have not been found, but they should be up to 20.\u2019\n\nThe Sun gathered that local divers combed the area in search of survivors, while some, according to the eyewitness, have been rescued with the help of boat drivers.\n\nTwo women who were rescued narrated their experiences.\n\nOne of them, identified as Tamunosowebi, explained: \u2018We went for the burial of our colleague\u2019s mother-in-law. As we reached the jetty, we saw a crowd there. So, we asked everyone to queue up.\n\n\u2018Before we closed our mouths, the first one broke. I jumped from the first one to the second one. Before I would land on the second side of the jetty, it collapsed. I found myself deep inside the water. I was shouting \u201cJesus, Jesus\u201d before the rescue team came to help me. We were many about 80 persons on the jetty.\u2019\n\nAnother survivor, Mrs Obele Fiberesima, said: \u2018We were at the jetty waiting to come back to Macoba, Port Harcourt. As we were there, there was a crowd waiting and only a boat was available. It cannot contain everybody. Before we could say queue up, everybody was inside the water. It was God that saved us.\u2019\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "Ahamefula Ogbu\n\nThe former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday identified corruption, poor leadership and wrong-headed policies as the bane of Nigeria, citing the regime of paying subsidy on petroleum products as part of the corrupt practice that may bring the country to its knees.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria also described as an assumption, the notion that Nigeria is an oil rich country.\n\nSanusi declared: \u201cThis has always been a big joke for me and we also talk about the fuel subsidy. President Jonathan tried to remove fuel subsidy and the people protested. You are producing two million barrels of oil for 180 million people and that\u2019s one barrel for 80 people. Saudi Arabia produces one barrel for three citizens.\n\n\u201cYou produce one barrel for 80 and your share of that revenue from that barrel is maybe half, so it translates to one barrel for 160 people. We need education, we need healthcare, infrastructure, telecommunication, agriculture and you decide that what they need more than anything else is cheap fuel and that doesn\u2019t make sense. We are throwing away millions of dollars in this scam called subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen oil prices go up, other producers rejoice but not so for Nigeria. Our refineries are not working and we have this scheme called subsidy which is really a scam and practically everything that comes in goes practically out to import petroleum products and to pay subsidy on those products.\n\n\u201cWhen you deal with corruption, you also have to look at creating the opportunities for corruption. Corruption thrives when you create an opportunity for people to take advantage of things. When you talk about the oil industry, for example, if you eliminate fuel subsidy, you eliminate fraud worth billions and millions of dollars. If there is no subsidy, what is the incentive to come and forge bills of laden and bribe Customs and bribe people?\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t create an arbitrage opportunity in foreign exchange market, how do you create corruption there? So, I think we need to look at the structures and processes and make sure we eliminate the avenues and incentives for people to be corrupt.\u201d\n\nHe said the second highest form of corruption \u201cis appointing people who are incompetent to positions.\u201d\n\nSanusi said: \u201cSometimes, it is not even so much of corruption but people don\u2019t even know what they are supposed to do; people who do not know why they are there; people who do not have the sense that at the end of their efforts, they are still human beings.\n\n\u201cIf every public officer starts thinking about how his actions and decisions affect a human being and how he can contribute positively to affect that human being, he will begin to address issues. But, I think you should ask, does this person even understand what he is saying, whether you are a minister or a civil servant? I think if you are a minister, at the end of eight years, you should assess how you affected the people.\u201d\n\nNo to Zoning of the Presidency\n\nSanusi also said zoning the Presidency to a particular region may leave Nigeria \u201cwith two useless candidates\u201d in 2023.\n\nHe said he had always objected to discussions that take into account where a president should come from.\n\nThe former CBN governor said \u201cNigeria needs a president who can deliver, irrespective of where he is from.\u201d\n\nSanusi said: \u201cI have always objected to this idea that we should focus on where the president comes from. We have got southern governors saying we want the presidency and some northern governors saying that they want it in the north. Have you noticed that nobody has given the name of who they want?\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is to corner the presidency to one part of the country and the big masquerade will come out. And that is why at the end of the exercise, you end up as Nigeria\u2026 presented with two useless candidates. Those who want to be president should show their face either from the north or the south.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we have before us very serious issues. You have a simple issue of electronic transmission of results which is designed to make the electoral process fairer and you have people saying that they do not want it, shamelessly announcing to the country that they want to rig. Why are we not talking about these issues?\n\n\u201cThe greatest weakness we have as a country is that we do not think. We are very smart when it comes to making money by doing our work but we do not apply critical intellect to\u2026 and these guys just take the entire country for a ride.\n\n\u201cGive me a president from any part of the country who can deliver and we should vote for him. He is not taking the presidency to his hometown.\u201d\n\nSanusi said civil society organisations and the national assembly \u201care not doing their jobs\u201d in terms of holding political society to account.\n\nEveryone wants office; everyone wants favours from the government. If we had a strong civil society holding political society to account, we would begin to improve and tackle issues,\u201d said the former CBN governor.\n\nNigeria Better Together Than Divided\n\nOn those agitating for the breakup of Nigeria, Sanusi said Nigeria \u201cis better together than divided,\u201d pointing out that countries that embraced dismemberment had found themselves in various conflicts and blamed the elites for using ethnicity and other factors to divide the country for their selfish gains.\n\nSanusi, who said he was a strong believer in a strong united Nigeria, believes that \u201conce the problem of leadership is addressed,\u201d most of the right decisions taken, and the system cleaned up of corruption, things would take a postive turn.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou hardly find a country that is homogenous and the same is with Nigeria,; that is why we are better together because if you try to divide the country, it will lead to further divisions and war like you have in Ethiopia and South Sudan.\u201d\n\nHe pointed at the North, West, East, Niger Delta and Middle Belt, which were all not homogenous and asked, \u201cHow many parts are you going to divide this country to ensure it is homogenous? The challenge is not in our diversity, the challenge is in the inability of the leadership to forge a nation.\n\n\u201cWe got out of a civil war and we are yet to start thinking like one country where people believe we are one. What happens is that from time to time we tend to have people in certain circles that see Nigeria as a place for extraction of rent and corruption.\n\n\u201cYou have different class factions of the elite who profit from creating a stage for themselves. If you have a northern president, how does that affect a poor northerner who is unemployed? If you have a southern president, how does it affect the common man in the south? It may benefit just a few from that zone\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer in Nigeria and I feel we are better off as one country than a divided country. 70 per cent of our problems are from wrong-headed policies.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*With 170,000 bpd rise, gradual production recovery begins\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nOil output of members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose in September to its highest since April 2020, as Nigeria\u2019s production also recovered from involuntary losses.\n\nThe group\u2019s top producers further eased supply curbs in September under a pact with its allies known as OPEC+, revealed a survey by Reuters.\n\nAccording to the survey, OPEC pumped 27.31 million barrels per day (bpd) last September, up 420,000 bpd from August\u2019s revised estimate.\n\nThe biggest rise in September was from Nigeria, where output rose by 170,000 bpd after Forcados force majeure and other problems in August were eased.\n\nThe Forcados terminal export outlet was under force majeure in August, limiting supply. Even so, Nigeria is pumping almost 100,000 bpd less than its OPEC target as under-investment restrains output.\n\nOPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, are easing output cuts made in April 2020 as demand recovers, although due to a lack of capacity in some members, OPEC+ is not delivering the full boost promised. This had helped support oil prices, which is trading above $80 a barrel, and close to a three-year high.\n\nThe OPEC+ agreement allows for a 400,000 bpd production increase in September from all members, of which 253,000 bpd is shared by the 10 OPEC members covered by the deal.\n\nWhile the 10 OPEC members raised output by more than last month\u2019s figures in September, they are still pumping less than expected under the latest deal, as OPEC compliance with pledged cuts was 114 per cent when compared with 115 per cent in August.\n\nOPEC+ meets on Monday to review its policy and is expected to re-confirm plans for the monthly increases.\n\nThe second-largest increase came from top exporter Saudi Arabia, which further raised supply as part of the September OPEC+ boost even as Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria made smaller increases.\n\nOutput declined or did not increase in Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, the survey found, owing to a lack of production capacity to add more supply.\n\nIran, which had managed to raise exports since the fourth quarter despite U.S. sanctions, has posted slightly higher output this month, the survey found.\n\nThe country is exempted from OPEC supply curbs due to the sanctions; although a larger export recovery depends on progress in talks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Those talks are currently stalled.\n\nAmong the other two producers exempted from curbs, Libyan and Venezuelan output also slightly increased, based on shipping data provided by external sources.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inability to meet its OPEC production quota has been a source of concern to the country which desperately needs every dollar it can possibly get, as the government continues to ration forex due to increasing scarcity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am enjoying what I\u2019m doing. It is a very exciting job and I am trying to have some successes here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the WTO boss began the year with \u201ca plan to score quick negotiating victories that she said would help reboot the dysfunctional Geneva-based trade body;\u201d but she has fully grasped the frustrating reality of the WTO\u2019s historical inertia.\n\nThe New York-based medium quoted five trade officials in Geneva who declined to be identified.\n\nThis year, Okonjo-Iweala had repeatedly told ambassadors and staff that she could easily walk away from the job, and reminded them she had not bought any furniture for her temporary home in Geneva, the officials said.\n\nAn early departure of the WTO\u2019s top trade official would add yet another layer of chaos to an organisation suffering from an existential crisis that may lead governments to conclude the WTO is not a credible forum for addressing their shared challenges, the medium stated.\n\nDeep divisions and a lack of trust are not new for the WTO, which requires consensus agreement among all 164 members to finalise multilateral accords.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s rigid negotiating structure and disparate interests of its diverse membership have precluded the organisation from delivering anything substantial for the better part of the past decade.\n\nLast year, Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s predecessor, Roberto Azevedo \u2013 cited the lack of progress at the WTO as his primary reason for resigning from the organisation a year before his tenure was scheduled to end.\n\nThe true test of Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s leadership will come in November, when she hosts the WTO\u2019s 12th ministerial conference \u2013 a gathering of the organisation\u2019s highest decision-making body, Bloomberg states, noting that, to date, WTO members have failed to make significant headway on the three priority areas Okonjo-Iweala identified for potential outcomes at the biennial meeting.\n\nThey are: an agreement to curb harmful fishery subsidies; a pledge to reduce trade-distorting agricultural policies; and a framework to expand global trade in vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nAccording to the president, a committee constituted to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria had successfully addressed a number of key issues, including \u201cnational security and cohesion; registration of physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee, which was set up in July, is led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who revealed in August that the ban would be lifted in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will soon be lifted as we are getting close to reaching full agreement,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe have agreed on some areas, hopefully in the next few days or weeks, we will conclude.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet. However, the Buhari administration has always been keen on regulating social media and internet-based broadcasting companies.\n\nTwitter is yet to respond to the latest news. It remains to be seen if the social media giant will meet the demands of Nigerian authorities, especially after choosing to base its African headquarters in Ghana \u2013 a country it describes as a \u201cchampion for democracy, supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "The Lagos Angel Network (LAN) has appointed a new Board of Governors (BoG) to oversee its affairs, effective from today October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to a LAN statement, the new board, chaired by Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, has the mandate to reposition the organisation with a focus on recruiting and educating local angel investors and championing advocacy for early-stage investing in Nigeria.\n\nOther members of the BoG are Biola Alabi, founder, Biola Alabi Media, who will sit as Deputy Chair of the BoG; Yemi Keri, co-founder, Rising Tide Africa; Olumide Soyombo, co-founder, Voltron Capital; Iyin Aboyeji, founder, Future Africa; and Gerrad Olisa-Ashar, co-founder, Diaspora Angel Network.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLAN was created to facilitate the development and emergence of an active early-stage investment community in Nigeria. Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "The website of Nigeria\u2019s official digital currency, eNaira, went live on Monday, four days before its planned launch on October 1, as disclosed by Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nDeveloped by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the apex bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria.\n\nA welcome note on the website describes the eNaira as a \u201cCentral Bank of Nigeria-issued digital currency that provides a unique form of money denominated in Naira.\u201d\n\nThe website is a central repository where users can find comprehensive information about the official digital currency, but it offers much more than just details of the eNaira. TechCabal reviewed the website and here are at least five other things Nigerians can do on the platform.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n1. Download the eNaira application\n\nThe eNaira app (termed \u201cSpeed\u201d) can be downloaded from either the Google PlayStore, Apple App Store, or by scanning a QR code on the website. The app is expected to be available for download from October 1, 2021, and will serve as the official wallet for smartphone users.\n\n2. Manage your wallet\n\neNaira users will be able to fund and manage funds in their wallets on the website once the digital currency is officially rolled out on October 1. According to information on the platform, the wallet offers a \u201cgreat way of making purchases with retailers on-site, transferring or sending money\u201d. The e-wallet can also be linked to bank accounts and used for pay-as-you-go services.\n\n3. Join the eNaira community\n\nThe community is a social hub where, according to a note on the website, eNaira users across the globe can connect with one another, share their experiences using the digital currency, offer as well as request help.\n\nThere are four community rooms, each designed to host conversations about eNaira regulations, merchants, wallet, and registrations. Nigerians who are interested in joining the community can sign up using their email addresses.\n\n4.

Being an eNaira user naturally transports you to the world of CBDCs and this space is your guide to that world,\u201d a note on the website reads.\n\n5. Read and share eNaira insights and experiences\n\nNigerians who choose to put their experiences with the eNaira in writing or want to share important insights can reach out to the authorities and have their feedback published on the Insights/Users Speak page of the website.\n\nThe eNaira website is loaded with very important information and instructions as well as answers to potential questions in the FAQ section.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "#TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Nigerians have been promised the lifting of the four-month-long Twitter ban. After the last promise in August of \u2018a few days\u2019 given by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, President Muhammadu Buhari, in his Independence Day speech, today mentioned that the ban would be lifted conditionally based on the fulfilment of some obligations by the social media giant.\n\nRecall that in early June 2021, the Nigerian government indefinitely suspended Twitter after the platform removed a Tweet by the president for violating its rules. An infringement on citizens\u2019 right to free speech, this move has drawn reactions from human rights advocacy groups across the country.\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), for instance, filed an appeal at the ECOWAS court in Abuja asking the court to order the president to lift the ban. However, recent developments show that the case has been adjourned for final judgement on January 20, 2022.\n\nSo far, the government claims that the global tech company is only partially cooperating and hasn\u2019t fully met its demands. To that end, it is awaiting a response on three final requests made to the social media platform, which are registration, physical presence in Nigeria, and fair taxation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all these, Twitter hasn\u2019t given any official comment on the negotiations. In the meantime, the economic impact of the ban on the country keeps piling. As of August 2021, the country had lost over $360 million to the ban.\n\nIt goes without saying that citizens have found ways to circumvent the situation using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), an act the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, considers a crime and has threatened to prosecute defaulters.\n\nNot ignoring the contention that came with this move, it is essential to explore how possible it may be for Twitter to meet these requirements.\n\nAre these demands hard to meet?\n\nOn the surface, these demands are pretty simple. After all, it appears to be what the social media company would have agreed to before establishing an office in any country. Case in point, its entrance into Africa in April 2021 and the surprising choice of Ghana.\n\nBased on Twitter\u2019s comment, the decision was based on shared values \u2014 Ghana supports free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet.\n\nTrue to this, the country is one of the African countries without any case of Internet censorship or government-influenced social media censorship. Besides, Ghana currently ranks 30th on the World Press Freedom Index compared to Nigeria\u2019s 120th and Ethiopia\u2019s 101st.\n\nOn closer inspection, these aren\u2019t traits that the Nigerian government has exhibited in the past. There have been reported cases of the government slamming fines on media houses for using user-generated content (UGC) obtained from citizens\u2019 social media accounts in their reportage and tagging verified news reports from online media platforms as \u2018fake news.\u2019\n\nAlso, there is the issue of trust. And this can\u2019t be forced; it has to be earned. This Forbes article helps express the thoughts about opening an office overseas better. One of them is clearly understanding the law of the land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it appears Twitter\u2019s delay in reaching a compromise with the Nigerian government might be more in consideration of the government\u2019s motive and possible implications on the citizens and other global tech companies.\n\nWith a physical office, any move the government isn\u2019t comfortable with may cause closure or worse.\n\nIn January 2019, the Nigerian military raided the Daily Trust office and detained some staff on the allegation that it published an article that divulged classified military information related to planned attacks against Boko Haram and thus undermined national security.\n\nStill, Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, told Techpoint Africa that the decision is up to Twitter to make. However, he believes such a move isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nShould you worry?\n\n\u201cThis is one of the government\u2019s ways of doubling down. The truth is, this is not just about Twitter; it is clearly an agenda to retain and expand control,\u201d Sesan commented when asked about what the motive behind the ban is.\n\nHe also opined that the move to categorise Over-the-Top (OTT) services as broadcasters and make them liable under the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) Act is uncalled for. This means that WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix would have to apply to the Corporation to request a licence to operate in the country.\n\nBut what is surprising, according to Sesan, is that the government didn\u2019t reveal the details of the licence. In his defence, these platforms are only intermediaries.\n\nApparently, this is not the first time this move has been made in Nigeria. The first two times \u2014 2017 and 2019 \u2014 it was the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC)\u2019s call. Major players kicked against it, although telecommunication operators supported the government in this instance.\n\nAs clearly stated in a previous article, taking these licences will set the modalities for the provision of these services in Nigeria and would allow NCC to exercise some control over OTT services which is not currently in place.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation\u2026\n\nAll over the world, the OTT services marketplace is still nascent. But that does not change the fact that there is a need for some regulation. While some nations already have regulatory oversight in place \u2014 the United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya \u2014 others are seriously considering putting relevant laws in place. And interestingly, these platforms are often categorised as broadcasters.\n\nProtests against these types of regulatory regimes often happen when the government does not have clearly defined rules to guide them in enforcing the laws or when the government has displayed strongarm tactics in similar circumstances in the past.\n\nIt is important to note that there are either two motives for regulations, to increase government control and to enforce strict censorship or to create a level playing ground for both online and offline players. Sadly, this is common in African and Asian countries.\n\nFor instance, when Netflix launched in Kenya in 2018, it was banned for two weeks by the government, after which the on-demand video streaming platform was told to get a filming license. At the moment, the country already has a digital tax in place.\n\nCurrently, not only are global companies obliged to abide by laws and taxed by the countries they are registered in, but they might also be subject to foreign laws whether they are present physically or not.\n\nIn Sesan\u2019s opinion, although the Nigerian judiciary is not entirely independent, he trusts activist judges to do their work to give sound judgement on the current state of trampling on citizens\u2019 right to information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Land prices to rise on new government\u2019s housing, infrastructure programmes",
          "text": "Land prices in Nigeria\u2019s leading and second tier cities, which are already resilient, are projected to spike over the next few years, a recent report on the Nigerian Real Estate Market has said. This projected price increase, the report adds, will happen mostly in locations with major construction projects and transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe new report, compiled by Northcourt Real Estate, explains that the price increase is to be driven by a number of factors, including private sector development activities as well as states and Federal Government\u2019s policies and programmes on housing and infrastructure developments.\n\nThe Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), a public-private partnership company, set up to address infrastructure deficit starting from the third quarter of 2021 (Q3\u2019 2021), is one such programme coming from the government.\n\n\u201cThis partnership is backed by a N15-trillion pocketbook. Federal Government\u2019s plan to construct 400 houses in each of the 774 Local Government Areas in Nigeria will increase the demand for land, although the overall impact will vary from one state to another,\u201d Ayo Ibaru, COO/director of research at Northcourt, explains.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has come up with new rules for industrial warehousing. This has introduced more regulation to the industrial submarket and is expected to strengthen the demand\u2013supply dynamic around land for this purpose.\n\nThe rules emphasise the provision of sufficient parking and loading/unloading spots for large vehicles. Ibaru says this explains the decision by the management of Flour Mills Nigeria, which, working with improved financial performance numbers (profit was up 126% y-o-y), has purchased 5,200 hectares of land as part of its expansion programme.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria needs more policies centered on power, housing, transportation \u2013 Adegbola\n\nThe report notes that 24 states of the federation have put up 2,000 hectares of land for the Federal Government\u2019s social housing programme, while 17 states have indicated interest in the solar power programme, predicting that both programmes, which are elements of the national Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), will impact land demand and price positively.\n\nAt private sector level, many players are expanding their frontiers and doing more developments. Oak Homes, for instance, says it is in its next level as it is moving into a new definition of smart and luxury living.\n\n\u201cWe need to redefine the game. So, there is a major overhaul of our team, which includes a new management staff with an expat chief operations officer (COO). He is worked with the big names and his major task is to make the Oak Homes brand even bigger. Our products in the coming months would redefine the tag \u2018affordable,\u201d notes Olukayode Olusanya, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nMeanwhile, investor interest coming from local real estate investors and developers is currently on the rise at Eko Atlantic City, a world-class city rising from land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean, adjacent to Victoria Island in Lagos.\n\nOfficials of Arkland Properties Limited, developers of A&A Towers in the city, confirm to BusinessDay in an interview that more local developers were already taking position in the city following what is apparently their success story in that city.\n\n\u201cWe moved into Eko Atlantic and started our first project, the A&A Tower. It is a tower of over 22 floors; we are doing it to showcase what is possible with the Nigerian spirit and what anyone can achieve when determined,\u201d Evelyn Edumoh, the company\u2019s chief operations officer, states.\n\nContinuing, Edumoh reveals, \u201cWe are the first purely indigenous company doing development in Eko Atlantic City. When we started that project, a lot of people thought we were crazy because it was such an audacious project. I can tell you that the project has opened doors for us.\n\n\u201cThe project has led us to start our second one, and even more Nigerian developers are now coming into the city. They are beginning to see that there is an opportunity for everyone there, and we have shown that there is growth in that city.\u201d\n\nAnother developer, who does not want his name mentioned, also says that interest in Eko Atlantic was rising, disclosing that by the first quarter of 2022, his company would be mobilising to site to develop two luxury towers of 30 floors each in the new city.\n\nLand price in the city remains a guarded secret as the promoters, South Energyx Nigeria, says it can only be made available to genuine buyers. Even at $1,250 per square metre it was sold a few years ago, Eko Atlantic City land remains the most expensive in Lagos.\n\nIt is followed closely by Banana Island and Old Ikoyi. As at the first half of this year, Old Ikoyi was selling for N514,889 per square metre, showing 18 percent increase in the corresponding period in 2020, when it was sold for N514,889 per square metre.\n\nLekki, on its part, has been strong. The price of land in that market node in the first half of 2021 was N246,785, representing 29 percent increase in its price as at the first half of 2020 when it was selling at N191,857 per square metre.\n\nVictoria Island is not as strong as land price in that axis within the period under review witnessed a decline from N315,775 per square metre in 2020 to N273,000 per square metre in the first half of 2021. This is about 14 percent decrease in price.",
          "summary": "This projected price increase, the report adds, will happen mostly in locations with major construction projects and transportation infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, investor interest coming from local real estate investors and developers is currently on the rise at Eko Atlantic City, a world-class city rising from land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean, adjacent to Victoria Island in Lagos.\nContinuing, Edumoh reveals, \u201cWe are the first purely indigenous company doing development in Eko Atlantic City.\nLand price in the city remains a guarded secret as the promoters, South Energyx Nigeria, says it can only be made available to genuine buyers.\nEven at $1,250 per square metre it was sold a few years ago, Eko Atlantic City land remains the most expensive in Lagos.",

          "text": "Japanese companies have a reputation for being huge manufacturing corporations owned by cohesive families with a large retinue of employees working with fierce devotion.\n\nToday, another world is emerging, one of the high-tech startups begun by young entrepreneurs who contribute a fresh global outlook and new generational attitudes to the traditional world of Japanese business.\n\nExemplifying this new entrepreneurship style is Softbank Corporation of Tokyo; a Japanese multinational tech conglomerate, which boasts of a $342.34 billion asset base as of 2020, according to information on its website.\n\nThe firm has joined a league with foreign investors who have indicated an eagerness to expand their businesses into Nigeria and other countries in Africa and take advantage of the continent\u2019s market.\n\nWithin the last six weeks, SoftBank has led two major capital injection deals in Nigerian start-ups space with the latest being a $200 million injection in Andela, a global engineering talent outsourcing company.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s investment in Andela is the company\u2019s second major investment in Africa following the $400 million Series C round of fintech platform OPay.\n\nThis latest investment deal of SoftBank is spearheaded by Masayoshi Son, one of the richest men in Japan, who has a $16.3 billion fortune and owns a $117.5 million Silicon Valley estate.\n\nDuring the firm\u2019s last annual general meeting, Son described SoftBank as a \u201ccapital provider for the information revolution\u201d in the 21st century in the same way that Mayer Amschel Rothschild was a capital provider for the industrial revolution in the 19th century.\n\nRead Also: SoftBank invests in Credit Suisse funds that finance its technology bets\n\n\u201cIn the industrial revolution, one of the main players was Rothschild,\u201d Son said, using one of the quirky slideshows that SoftBank has become well known for to illustrate his points. \u201cWe would like to be the capital provider for the information revolution. That is our new definition or new positioning I would say to describe SoftBank Group.\u201d\n\nSoftBank has invested in 264 companies through its two Vision Funds, as well as a dedicated Latin America fund.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the companies are not actually making money,\u201d Son said. \u201cWe are taking risks and at the same time providing funds as a capital provider.\u201d\n\nNet Asset Value (NAV) is a key metric that SoftBank focuses on when measuring its own performance, Son said. At the end of March 2021, SoftBank\u2019s NAV was about $235 billion.\n\nThe billionaire said many people have asked him over the last three or four years what SoftBank Group is, with some telling him they like him \u201cvery much\u201d as an entrepreneur but not as an investor.\n\n\u201cActually, I am not a simple or a traditional investor compared to the others,\u201d Son said.\n\nMasayoshi Son also told shareholders at the AGM, he would start making personal investments alongside SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Vision Fund, a controversial step many analysts say could lead to conflicts of interest as his company backs tech startups.\n\nThe Japanese billionaire explained he will begin co-investing in Vision Fund 2, an investment vehicle where SoftBank has been the sole source of capital. The fund can invest up to $2.6 billion and will own 17.25percent of the capital. It will have a similar agreement with SoftBank\u2019s Latin American fund.\n\nAnalysts and fund managers wondered why the billionaire would opt for such a structure given the potential for confusion and conflict.\n\nDefending the decision, Son said the SoftBank board approved the structure, while he recused himself from the vote.\n\n\u201cBecause I think I want management to share the investment risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough thick and thin, one thing doesn\u2019t change \u2013 my belief that the AI revolution will absolutely continue for the next 10 to 20 years.\u201d\n\nHaving funded nearly 30 of the more than 600 unicorns in the world, which are companies worth over a billion dollars, the Japanese telecom giant has been on a shopping spree, seeking promising new AI startups to bet big on, often with celebrities on board.\n\nToday, the \u201cinformation revolution (is) in full bloom,\u201d according to Son, who said artificial intelligence, is a particular area of focus for SoftBank.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are the biggest in terms of providing capital,\u201d he said on AI, adding that driving, healthcare, retail, finance, and education will all be redefined by AI in the years ahead.\n\nIn the industrial revolution, manpower was replaced by machines, Son said. \u201cIn the information revolution, AI will be the one replacing machinery,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from SoftBank, other multinational companies from the United States, Japan, and Latin America are also investing or expanding their businesses into Nigeria, to take advantage of the country\u2019s over 200 million population market.\n\nThese foreign investors are betting big on young entrepreneurs who are stepping into voids left by unimaginative public policies and shoddy infrastructure.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, FairMoney, a Nigerian fintech, raised $42m in a funding round led by Tiger Global Management, a New York hedge fund. FairMoney has received the go-ahead from Nigeria\u2019s central bank to take deposits. Last year it disbursed small loans averaging $65 and worth a total of $93m to roughly 1.3m people and microenterprises.\n\nInterswitch, a digital payments platform, gained its unicorn spurs when Visa bought a 20 percent stake in it for $200m in 2019. Flutterwave, which has offices in Lagos and San Francisco, hit the $1bn mark in March when it raised $170m from US investors.",

          "title": "2023: Akpabio, Wike jovial sparks reveal underlining currents and re-alignments",
          "text": "The security facility near the Port Harcourt international Airport zone actually looks grandiose especially with total of 68 flats, armory and underground cell, but many still wondered how the housing project attracted the highest citizen in the land, President Muhammadu Buhari, for its commissioning.\n\nHe was actually represented by the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, but many still wondered how a 12-storey tower headquarters of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) could only attract the president\u2019s virtual presence but this one attracted his physical attention, though in physical representation, going by what it takes to move the presidency to a location and back.\n\nSo, on Tuesday, September 28, 2021, the Airport Road, right from the Rumuokoro Roundabout to Elele town, was cordoned off from commercial traffic. In the sky was a military jet hovering around the area till event was over; full presidential sortie.\n\nThou peaceful Ikwerre people\n\nA top government official commended the Ikwerre people for maintaining exemplary peace during construction stages and that even, some of their women cooked food for the workers at the site. There was huge applause, but he did not know that most of workmen were their kinsmen. But, when the dignitaries began to starve as noon dragged, they learnt that the \u2018peaceful\u2019 youths waylaid the food convoy at the entrance and scattered and ate it. The armed securities controlled the inside, the unknown youths controlled the outside; and peace reigned.\n\nA house built in 10 years\n\nHow long does it take, or should it take to build a house or a cluster of houses? This one is 68 flats. The six blocks took over 10 years for an agency that saw N6trillion pass through its fingers. The N6trn itself is under hot contention because many say the Minister of Justice added instead of subtracting actual releases to the NDDC from total budgeted sum. Be that as it may, would it be right to say lack of funds stalled the project from 2011/2012 to 2021?\n\nRead Also: NDDC Forensic Audit Report: Have you read it?\n\nThis question brought out another conflict. The audience was mixed: PDP and APC lords, and many who were former and later lords of both parties. So, if the contract was awarded in 2011/12, and GovernorNyesom Wike said it should have been completed in about a year or two, so, it means PDP should have completed it far before APC\u2019s Buhari would show up. For a son of the soil to be president and such a project suffered such fate, which party needed to face trashing at the market square? Yet, most politicians spoke as if others were bad and they alone were good. This prompted those sitting where we were to hiss thus: \u201cUntil accountability, naming and shaming returns to public service and governance, villains will continue to pose as heroes\u201d.\n\nInstead, the interim Managing Director of the NDDC, EfiongAkwa, told the President that he visited the site in March 2021 and what he saw pained his heart. He said he summoned his \u2018council\u2019 (40 directors) and asked; what do we do, what can we do? The answer is what the world saw. Funds had to be scratched from everywhere to get the task done. Why? His Excellency had given a marching order that the critical projects must be completed.\n\nIOCs trapped funds?\n\nThe NDDC MD/CEO mentioned two critical factors that militated against the zeal to resurrect the SPU Housing Project: (By the way, SPU means Special Protection Unit of the police. It is obvious they are the most privileged section of the police and most politically exposed because of the sensitivity and topness of the VIPs they protect).\n\nThe MD used the auspicious occasion with presence of the second topmost personality in the presidency to report the hushed word of the oil corporation\u2019s funds not getting to the Commission to execute the mandate of the president. Or, how would Mr. President mandate that critical projects be executed while waiting for forensic audit and board inauguration, only to not react to the loud secret of the IOCs funds not getting to the Commission?\n\nIt has been said severally that when the National Assembly failed to force a board on the Commission, failed to sack the previous interim MD (Daniel Pondei), they now allegedly got a security agency to block the Accounts of the Commission or got the security agency to open what they call EFCC/NDDC account with the CBN wherein are lodged all further remittances of the Commission. The idea is to warehouse the funds away from the supervising minister and the Interim MD. Some praise this, some condemn it. So, saying it to the hearing of the VP on behalf of the President means it\u2019s no more a secret, and the President can no longer say he has not heard it. Is the action right? Is it wrong? Say so now. Those sitting around us wondered how the president would give such mandate and look away as the funds remain trapped. Could this be the real reason for making Mr. President attend physically at commissioning, so he can hear it in public and probably scream, you mean it? Coupled with this is what the MD called paucity of funds from the federal allocation.\n\nThe second factor that actually held down work was Covid-19 pandemic. His words: \u201cThe presidency mandated us to complete abandoned projects that we consider very critical and of importance to the people of the region. This project required huge management skills to execute in the face of funding constraints.\u201d\n\nMore from NDDC CEO\n\nDespite the funding constraints, the interim boss who has been commended for steadying the ship of the Commission so far, said: We are also striving to complete a huge power project in Ondo State as well as a 1000-bed hostel in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State which is 98 percent completed. In two weeks from now, it will be ready for commissioning.\n\nHe also put the project in perspective: Nigeria has 17m housing deficit; we have reduced that a bit with 68 flats here.\n\nBasket of commendations for Akwa\n\nDespite the heaps of opprobrium on the NDDC and the interim admin system, EfiongAkwa, a lawyer, a doctorate degree holder, and fellow of two distinguished professions (Administration and Accounting), won commendations from all speakers. Since he took over from Pondei, he has managed to calm even impossible quarters such as the governors, especially the host, the National Assembly, among others. Governor Wike even said he had never attended NDDC event, but he did this time. Akwa was said to have offset some of the partnership debts that would have gone to court. The minister always commends him, the security agencies, etc. Maybe, the Commission would look back and remember him. Wike said Akwa would have peace after leaving the hot seat because he has many important projects to point to.\n\nWike is another public personality that won all round commendation from all quarters for what he is doing and saying in Nigeria. The applause was huge and passionate each time he moved a finger. Many began to wonder if Nigeria should look any further for a future leader (2023).\n\nIG of Police: Alkali Baba Usman\n\n\u201cI am highly elated at this landmark project being handed over to me today. It is significant to the police. This is the first massive project to the Special Protection Unit (SPU) of the Nigerian Police since its creation in 2009,\u201d Usman said.\n\nThe NDDC contributes to achieving internal security mandate in the country; thus, the Commission is not ready to watch from the side. We implore other agencies to join in fighting insecurity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe police are just emerging from #EndSARS crisis which destroyed a lot of police assets, and this donation is quite heartening. This model is now to be adopted. Let the NDDC help in doing this in the other NDDC states, at least in phases.\n\n\u201cI insist on maintenance of this edifice and on the right behaviour in use of this place. I must thank the Vice President who has been helping to push police reform matters in government.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Akpabio vs Nunieh: Let nothing happen to our daughter \u2013 Wike\n\nOlojimiOjo: Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on NDDC\n\nWe just commissioned the NDDC Towers (headquarters) few weeks ago, and now this. It\u2019s like the mandate of the Commission is now being realised. It means we as Nigerians can achieve anything if we agree and set our minds on it.\n\nOur duty at the House of Representatives Committee on NDDC is to demand and ensure accountable use of resources. With this pace, we may see the East West Road completed and commissioned.\n\nThank you GovernorNyesom Wike! You are about the only governor steadily executing projects. You have given us reason to know that the Niger Delta can work and that prosperity may return.\n\nSenator Peter Nwaboshi\n\nWe must thank the Management of the NDDC. Today is not a day for me to make speeches because I just lost a kinsman, a judge.\n\nUncommon banters: Akpabio vs Wike\n\nAkpabio: I will not join in urging Governor Wike to join our party. We already have our problems, let him not add his own.\n\nBut, the same person later in his remarks, though still joking, urged Governor Wike to cross over. He even said he would not join to call him performing governor unless he joined. \u201cCome over to where you will be appreciated\u201d.\n\nWike: Malaria is better than cancer: The crowd was rocking as Wike was marching toward the podium. They knew he would bomb Akpabio back. A video has emerged after the visit that showed both men enjoying in an evening; throwing more banters at each other.\n\nWike began slowly, saying he thought it was commissioning but that the Minister has turned it into a political rally. Many felt that Wike who went around the state in 60 days few months ago commissioning projects was also accused of turning the events to campaign rallies. So, the turf seemed familiar.\n\nOn joining Akpabio\u2019s party, Wike said it was better to remain where there is malaria than to where there is cancer. Malaria can be treated but cancer at developed stage is nothing but death. I don\u2019t want to die.\n\nHe reminded Akpabio that it was in PDP that he (minister) achieved uncommon results that made him uncommon governor. Now, has been an uncommon minister. So, retrace your steps to the PDP.\n\nThe crowd rocked more and more.\n\nNormal Akpabio: Yes, 13,777 projects were abandoned\n\nHe said: President Buhari gave us marching order to complete the NDDC headquarters and we did. This is a new NDDC where every kobo will count. Eg: Diesel supply contract: The rented NDDC building never had public power supply for all the years it was used (2000 to 2021) even when it could have taken not more than N20m to do it. Instead, they preferred the diesel supply contract sustained the 8-story building for the years the Commission was there. Now, the NDDC is on course. It will not be same story.\n\nWe will be knocking on Mr. President\u2019s door to help us commission the Power project in Ondo before end of November 2021. The Niger Delta is now the most peaceful zone in Nigeria. We commend the Ikwerre ethnic group where this project is located for their peaceful disposition during construction period. They even cooked for the contract workers and related well. Let them keep this spirit up.\n\nThe East West Road will be completed. President Buhari has pledged this, from Warri (Delta State) to Oron in Akwa Ibom State (from Calabar axis).\n\nHe said the much-awaited forensic audit has been submitted and Mr. President has handed it to the Minister of Justice; now, recovery follows. Some 13,777 projects were abandoned. We pick some we can complete. NDDC cannot be same again. It is no more a cash cow and election-funding centre.\n\nWike: I will shut down NDDC Road if they do not give us N2.5bn counterpart fund\n\nYou say 13,777 projects have been abandoned by the NDDC. Why would it not be so, considering the hot race to be Managing Director, Executive Director (Finance) and Executive Director (Projects). The MD will run to Abuja every now and then to take directives.\n\nIn his speech, the Rivers State Governor NyesomEzenwo Wike berated the NDDC for taking about eleven years to complete the SPU Base 6 housing projects.\n\nAccording to Governor Wike, it is however, not surprising because NDDC projects, often, are abandoned due to poor conceptualisation, their political nature, and absence of commensurate provision of fund.\n\nMr. Vice President, this is my first time of attending what NDDC is doing. In fact, I don\u2019t know who gave out the information. About seven months ago, I had decided to take over this property for security reasons.\n\nI\u2019m sure somebody must have told the interim head, that look, better go and complete the project, as the governor is about taking them over.\n\nYou see, this is the problem with Nigeria. Look at a project like this that was awarded in 2011/2012. Ten years after is when we are commissioning it. This project shouldn\u2019t have lasted this long.\n\nWell, the minister has told us here that over 13,777 projects of NDDC were abandoned. Why will they not be abandoned when they\u2019re projects without conceptualisation, projects being done politically, projects with no funding?\u201d\n\nWike said the problem of nonperformance of NDDC should not be blamed on the commission alone, but also on Abuja portfolio contractors and other political interests who are seeking compensation from those they have assisted to positions within NDDC.\n\nAccording to him, these people have all ensured that the Commission remained as a cash cow to serve as avenue to siphon money for their election purposes.\n\n\u201cLet nobody say that the problem of NDDC is only of the Niger Delta, no. The problem of NDDC is from the entire Nigeria. You have the Abuja problem, and you have the Niger Delta problem here. If you helped somebody to be made the Managing Director, why not allow the person to do the work? Why do you go to collect all the money?\n\n\u201cAs Akwa has done these things, when he leaves, will he not be happy and have peace of mind? He will point at these things and say, go and see the things I did.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Wike urged the leadership of the NDDC to fulfil its promise to pay N2. 5 billion as counterpart funding for the reconstruction and expansion of the Eastern Bye-Pass Road that leads to their corporate headquarters office in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governor also told NDDC to adopt the culture of synergising with governors of states in Niger Delta to understand their needs in order to achieve a uniform and purposeful development. \u201cWhy do you jump into a state road and start construction?\u201d\n\nWhile commending the current interim committee for their dogged determination to right the wrongs of the past and completing projects it inherited, Governor Wike also lauded the Inspector General of Police for removing politics from the posting of police commissioners to the state.\n\n\u201cThis is the only IG, I have seen, since 2015, I have had over 15 Commissioners of Police. They change them by the minute and that had affected the security architecture. Look at the peace we are having in Rivers State today, it\u2019s because the security agencies in this state are now apolitical.\u201d\n\nWike also used the occasion to reaffirm that he was not leaving the People\u2019s Democratic Party, which he described as the hope of Nigeria.\n\nWho is innocent?\n\nMany in the crowd raised eyebrows over Wike\u2019s berating of what is happening in the NDDC. He accused the people running the Commission of pestering the CEO for funds, of using the place as election centre, and of abandoning projects. These however, were the same accusations leveled against Wike when he was minister and his party was running the NDDC. Besides, most of the contracts that were abandoned were under the PDP. The 1000-bed hostels in various universities in the Niger Delta were awarded and abandoned in the PDP days. Many of the new MDs have been pressing the contractors (who were very close to power) to go back to site and deliver the hostels for students, but nothing has improved. Some had pointed at the Minister of Transportation of being the one Wike was referring to, yet, others had been pointing fingers at Akpabio. Thus, it has been a game of pointing hands to make the masses not understand who ruined the NDDC, despite the availability of a forensic audit that is there to call a spade a spade. Soon, truth would be on the streets.\n\nEnter the dove: Osinbajo\n\nBy the time the man of law, VP Osinbajo, took the stage, the banters were calming down. The slim unassuming VP scratched at the trending banters. He said he was going to settle the two friends (Akpabio and Wike), in a matter of minutes. Many waited till he left to see the comedy of settling those men, until the VP delivered and left.\n\nApparently, the VP was not in any mood to be distracted by the duo in delivering his message for a president that was not part of political jokes and banters. He said, I am here for the President. I will proceed to read his address. Anywhere you hear \u2018I\u2019, know that it is Mr. President.\n\nBuhari: Police transformation has begun\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari explained that the provision of comfortable housing for officers of the Nigeria Police is a crucial part of the ongoing reformation of the nation\u2019s security architecture to enable them perform optimally.\n\nHe maintained that directives had already been issued that the building of barracks for men and women of the Police Force should be done in collaboration with the Social Housing efforts of the Family Home Fund.\n\nAccording to him, this will ensure speedy execution of all of the projects in all of the barracks that need to be provided.\n\nPresident Buhari stated that the reform of the police force also included a yearly recruitment target that has been set to increase the number of police personnel. He said, already, the process is on to equip the personnel with personal gears and hardware. (Nigeria strives to increase from 370,000 in 2015 to 650,000 policemen).\n\n\u201cIt is my understanding that the contract for this building was originally awarded in 2012 but was stalled by a series of delays. I am gratified that it has finally been delivered.\n\n\u201cThis project is important because it is a means by which we can alleviate the accommodation challenges of senior security personnel posted to Rivers State and ultimately enhance the security footprint in the region. The cumulative impact of this and other similar projects will be the improvement of security in the state and the consolidation of the economic and social life of the people of the area.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said his administration was looking at other sources of funding of the nation\u2019s security agencies to ensure that the pursuit for peace, prosperity, and development across the country is achieved.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs 2023 beckons, and as the pendulum seems to swing to the South and maybe South-East, a silent realignment seems to be on the way. Many have asked what Wike wants. He was gravitating to the north, making heavy donations. Many felt he was angling for VP slot. Soon, he began to spearhead an aggressive Southern activism that has now set him out as someone to beat. His fight with Uche Secondus who was seen to block a Southern slot confused observers more. Now, it looks clear that Wike is not angling for a VP slot. Whatever it is, many top persons in the South have noticed him. An APC chieftain has consistently accused Wike of using some APC members to stage a passage for him to come in and take over.

Rather than live in fear or doubt, get vaccinated. If you believe that getting vaccinated will put your mind at rest, then go ahead.\n\n\u201cDaddy, are you saying that you too could be vaccinated? If there are nations in the world that say that I cannot come to preach the gospel there because of vaccination, I will do anything for Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cIf vaccination or no vaccination is going to hinder me from doing the work God has called me to do, even if they ask me to be vaccinated 100 times, I will be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t ever say that you heard from me that I said that you should not be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nAdeboye, however, described as laughable, the move by some governors who made COVID-19 vaccination compulsory before people could attend church gatherings.\n\nHe noted that such leaders were missing the point, saying that the number of vaccine jabs available in the country was not enough to go round.\n\nWith the detection of the deadly Delta variant globally, some countries have made COVID-19 vaccination a compulsory immigration item.\n\nNigeria has so far recorded over 200,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,700 associated deaths since the index case of the virus was reported in the country in March 2020, according to statistics by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.\n\nWith the number of cases and fatalities on the rise, the NCDC continues to urge Nigerians to maintain social distancing and hygiene practices as well as use masks in public to prevent transmission of the lethal virus which has been identified to move through droplets.\n\nThe Federal Government through the National Primary Health Care Development Agency has since been encouraging Nigerians to take COVID-19 vaccines in order for the country to achieve herd immunity.\n\nAbout five million Nigerians have since received their first shots of COVID-19 vaccination while about two million have completed their second doses, according to NPHCDA statistics as of end of September.\n\nThe government also encourages religious and political leaders to take the vaccine to dissipate vaccine hesitancy among the populace.\n\nHowever, the Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide aka Winners\u2019 Chapel, David Oyedepo, said that he won\u2019t take the COVID-19 vaccine jab, adding that he is not a guinea pig.",

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former governor of Lagos State, has revealed that he had a difficult health condition, claiming that his \u201cphysiotherapy was ghastly.\u201d\n\nTinubu said this while addressing members of the House of Representatives northern caucus that visited him in London on Friday, according to Punch.\n\nThe former governor, who has been in the United Kingdom for the last three months since undergoing knee surgery, told the gathering, \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome.\u201d\n\nSince his departure, Tinubu\u2019s London home has become a Mecca of sorts as he has been visited by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nNEWS DIRECT had reported last week that Fayemi also confirmed that Tinubu had surgery recently and he (Fayemi) was in London to show solidarity.\n\nThe governor had said, \u201cHe (Akeredolu) and I were in London together to see our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, but it had absolutely nothing to do with 2023 presidential plans whatsoever. That\u2019s not the reason why we went there.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju had just surgery, it is simply proper etiquette or behaviour both in the part of the country where I come from but also generally that when a friend and elder is undergoing health challenges, it would be improper on your part not to show solidarity and support.\n\n\u201cThat is simply what took us there; we wanted to associate ourselves with him at a time of need and as an elder, as a mentor and as a big figure in our political party. Nothing wrong in paying him a courtesy visit to check on him to see how he was faring and we did that and we returned. It has nothing to do with 2023; let me make that absolutely clear.\u201d\n\nTinubu\u2019s health has been a subject of controversy of late.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari also made a surprise visit to Tinubu in London where he was seen leaning on a walking stick.\n\nNEWS DIRECT had reported that Tinubu underwent a knee surgery at the John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland, US.\n\nThe APC chieftain, it had been learnt, left the US for the United Kingdom on crutches, a few days after the surgery.\n\nSources close to Tinubu told SaharaReporters that he wanted the surgery in Paris, France but changed his plan over rumours of his death.\n\n\u201cTinubu had his second surgery at John Hopkins University in Maryland recently. He was accompanied by a popular Nigerian doctor in Chicago. He had wanted the surgery in Paris but when rumour was rife about his death, he hurriedly left for Nigeria and went to John Hopkins,\u201d one of the sources had said.\n\n\u201cHe left the US for the UK on crutches,\u201d another source revealed.\n\nAs it was Reported on July 31 that Tinubu, who has had several medical trips this year alone, had a surgery about two weeks earlier and could be billed for another one.\n\nThe APC National Leader has been off official and party functions in the country for a while, amidst talks that he is being positioned for the 2023 presidency to succeed the incumbent repressive regime of Buhari.\n\n\u201cTinubu is hospitalised in Maryland, US. His health is failing. He couldn\u2019t participate in launching his Arewa library, and he couldn\u2019t participate in the Local Government Area elections last week. He could not attend today\u2019s APC congress due to health reasons.\n\n\u201cHe had a surgery last week,\u201d an authoritative source had disclosed.\n\nA few days after the story, photographs of Tinubu hosting Sanwo-Olu in London surfaced where the duo were seen together in a room.\n\nReports have it that the meeting was held to put an end to speculations surrounding the APC National Leader\u2019s health status.\n\nIn January 2021, Tinubu was also reported sick and hospitalised in Paris, France.\n\nTinubu had earlier complained of exhaustion and travelled out to rest before the news of his collapse went viral.\n\nHe was flown to Paris for medical attention in the first week of January.\n\n\u201cTinubu is in Paris, France for a medical checkup. His health is deteriorating. Old age and other stuff, but he still wants to be president. This could mean another medical tourism p\n\nresidency for our country,\u201d a top source had at that time revealed.",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "California will become the first US state to require COVID-19 vaccinations for children to attend public and private schools in person in a mandate that could effect millions of students.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that the coronavirus shot will be added to 10 other immunizations already required for school kids, including those for measles and mumps.\n\nExemptions would be granted for medical reasons or because of religious or personal beliefs but the exemption rules haven\u2019t been written yet pending public comment.\n\nAny student without an exemption who refuses to get the vaccine would be forced to do independent study at home.\n\n\u201cWe want to end this pandemic. We are all exhausted by it,\u201d Newsom said during a news conference at a San Francisco middle school after visiting with seventh graders.\n\n\u201cVaccines work. It\u2019s why California leads the country in preventing school closures and has the lowest case rates,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nThe mandate will be phased in as the U.S. government grants final vaccine approval for age groups. Currently, children 12 to 15 can only get the Pfizer vaccine under an emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vaccines for children 5 to 11 are still in the testing stage.\n\nUnder California\u2019s mandate, students in seventh to 12th grades would have to be vaccinated by the semester following full U.S. approval of the shots for their age group, probably meaning by next July. It will be even longer for children in kindergarten through sixth grades.\n\nThe mandate eventually will affect more than 6.7 million public and private school students in the nation\u2019s most populous state. California already has a mask requirement for schoolchildren.\n\nUntil now, Newsom had left the decision on student vaccine mandates to local school districts, leading to a variety of different orders. In Los Angeles, a vaccine mandate for eligible students is set to take effect in January.\n\nThe announcement drew swift reaction from parents, including some who said they should have the final choice of whether to vaccinate their children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious. On so many levels,\u201d said Jenny Monir, a Los Angeles mother of two who said she felt Newsom\u2019s mandate was made more for political than public health reasons. \u201cWe\u2019re just pawns in an elite game.\u201d\n\nJanet Meadows, whose children are in first grade and preschool, said she\u2019d consider homeschooling her children before vaccinating them. The 41-year-old from Kern County said she\u2019s worried about the health effects of the not-yet-approved shots for children.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we know enough about the vaccine to make our children get it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of unknowns. We don\u2019t need to rush into this right now.\u201d\n\nOthers praised Newsom\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see that we\u2019re trying to get this health crisis under control,\u201d said Andrew Patterson, father of an elementary school student in San Francisco. \u201cAnd we have lots of other vaccine requirements. I don\u2019t see why this one would be any different.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has one of the highest vaccine rates in the country \u2014 84% of people 12 and older have gotten at least one shot, and 70% are fully vaccinated. But only 63.5% of children ages 12 to 17 have received a dose and the state has a vocal minority skeptical of both the vaccine and the government\u2019s assurances of its safety.\n\nNewsom has been one of the most aggressive governors on coronavirus restrictions, issuing the nation\u2019s first statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020 that was soon followed by 41 other states. More recently, Newsom required California\u2019s roughly 2.2 million health care workers and most state employees to get vaccinated to keep their jobs.\n\nThe governor was emboldened after easily defeating a recall effort last month fueled by anger over his handling of the pandemic. He says he interpreted his landslide victory as an endorsement of his vaccine policies.\n\nNewsom hasn\u2019t backed all vaccine mandates, however. He recently opposed a requirement for prison guards that a federal judge imposed. Critics used that example to say Newsom is driven more by politics than science, noting the labor union of corrections officers had donated to his campaign to defeat the recall.\n\n\u201cCalifornia kids made the mistake of not giving millions to his campaigns,\u201d Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley tweeted Friday. Kiley was among 46 candidates who ran to replace the governor during the recall election.\n\nNewsom\u2019s announcement comes as COVID-19 infections in most of California have dropped markedly. The statewide positivity rate for the last week was 2.8%, and the average number of daily cases was about 6,355, roughly half what it was when the latest surge peaked in mid-August. Hospitalizations have fallen by 40%.\n\nIn Los Angeles County \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest, with more than 10 million residents \u2014 just 1.7% of people tested for the virus have it, and daily infections are down by half in the last month, when most kids went back to school.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s largest teachers unions back the vaccination mandate, as does the California Association of School Boards.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jocelyn Gecker and Haven Daley in San Francisco, Amy Taxin in Orange County and Terry Chea contributed.",

          "text": "Oil output of members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose in September to its highest since April 2020, as Nigeria\u2019s production also recovered from involuntary losses.\n\nThe group\u2019s top producers further eased supply curbs in September under a pact with its allies known as OPEC+, revealed a survey by Reuters.\n\nAccording to the survey, OPEC pumped 27.31 million barrels per day (bpd) last September, up 420,000 bpd from August\u2019s revised estimate.\n\nThe biggest rise in September was from Nigeria, where output rose by 170,000 bpd after Forcados force majeure and other problems in August were eased.\n\nThe Forcados terminal export outlet was under force majeure in August, limiting supply. Even so, Nigeria is pumping almost 100,000 bpd less than its OPEC target as under-investment restrains output.\n\nOPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, are easing output cuts made in April 2020 as demand recovers, although due to a lack of capacity in some members, OPEC+ is not delivering the full boost promised. This had helped support oil prices, which is trading above $80 a barrel, and close to a three-year high.\n\nThe OPEC+ agreement allows for a 400,000 bpd production increase in September from all members, of which 253,000 bpd is shared by the 10 OPEC members covered by the deal.\n\nWhile the 10 OPEC members raised output by more than last month\u2019s figures in September, they are still pumping less than expected under the latest deal, as OPEC compliance with pledged cuts was 114 per cent when compared with 115 per cent in August.\n\nOPEC+ meets on Monday to review its policy and is expected to re-confirm plans for the monthly increases.\n\nThe second-largest increase came from top exporter Saudi Arabia, which further raised supply as part of the September OPEC+ boost even as Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria made smaller increases.\n\nOutput declined or did not increase in Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, the survey found, owing to a lack of production capacity to add more supply.\n\nIran, which had managed to raise exports since the fourth quarter despite U.S. sanctions, has posted slightly higher output this month, the survey found.\n\nThe country is exempted from OPEC supply curbs due to the sanctions; although a larger export recovery depends on progress in talks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Those talks are currently stalled.\n\nAmong the other two producers exempted from curbs, Libyan and Venezuelan output also slightly increased, based on shipping data provided by external sources.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inability to meet its OPEC production quota has been a source of concern to the country which desperately needs every dollar it can possibly get, as the government continues to ration forex due to increasing scarcity.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "title": "Muhammadu Sanusi II: Nigeria Wasting Millions of Dollars through Subsidy Scam",
          "text": "The former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday identified corruption, poor leadership and wrong-headed policies as the bane of Nigeria, citing the regime of paying subsidy on petroleum products as part of the corrupt practice that may bring the country to its knees.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria also described as an assumption, the notion that Nigeria is an oil rich country.\n\nSanusi declared: \u201cThis has always been a big joke for me and we also talk about the fuel subsidy. President Jonathan tried to remove fuel subsidy and the people protested. You are producing two million barrels of oil for 180 million people and that\u2019s one barrel for 80 people. Saudi Arabia produces one barrel for three citizens.\n\n\u201cYou produce one barrel for 80 and your share of that revenue from that barrel is maybe half, so it translates to one barrel for 160 people. We need education, we need healthcare, infrastructure, telecommunication, agriculture and you decide that what they need more than anything else is cheap fuel and that doesn\u2019t make sense. We are throwing away millions of dollars in this scam called subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen oil prices go up, other producers rejoice but not so for Nigeria. Our refineries are not working and we have this scheme called subsidy which is really a scam and practically everything that comes in goes practically out to import petroleum products and to pay subsidy on those products.\n\n\u201cWhen you deal with corruption, you also have to look at creating the opportunities for corruption. Corruption thrives when you create an opportunity for people to take advantage of things. When you talk about the oil industry, for example, if you eliminate fuel subsidy, you eliminate fraud worth billions and millions of dollars. If there is no subsidy, what is the incentive to come and forge bills of laden and bribe Customs and bribe people?\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t create an arbitrage opportunity in foreign exchange market, how do you create corruption there? So, I think we need to look at the structures and processes and make sure we eliminate the avenues and incentives for people to be corrupt.\u201d\n\nHe said the second highest form of corruption \u201cis appointing people who are incompetent to positions.\u201d\n\nSanusi said: \u201cSometimes, it is not even so much of corruption but people don\u2019t even know what they are supposed to do; people who do not know why they are there; people who do not have the sense that at the end of their efforts, they are still human beings.\n\n\u201cIf every public officer starts thinking about how his actions and decisions affect a human being and how he can contribute positively to affect that human being, he will begin to address issues. But, I think you should ask, does this person even understand what he is saying, whether you are a minister or a civil servant? I think if you are a minister, at the end of eight years, you should assess how you affected the people.\u201d\n\nNo to Zoning of the Presidency\n\nSanusi also said zoning the Presidency to a particular region may leave Nigeria \u201cwith two useless candidates\u201d in 2023.\n\nHe said he had always objected to discussions that take into account where a president should come from.\n\nThe former CBN governor said \u201cNigeria needs a president who can deliver, irrespective of where he is from.\u201d\n\nSanusi said: \u201cI have always objected to this idea that we should focus on where the president comes from. We have got southern governors saying we want the presidency and some northern governors saying that they want it in the north. Have you noticed that nobody has given the name of who they want?\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is to corner the presidency to one part of the country and the big masquerade will come out. And that is why at the end of the exercise, you end up as Nigeria\u2026 presented with two useless candidates. Those who want to be president should show their face either from the north or the south.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we have before us very serious issues. You have a simple issue of electronic transmission of results which is designed to make the electoral process fairer and you have people saying that they do not want it, shamelessly announcing to the country that they want to rig. Why are we not talking about these issues?\n\n\u201cThe greatest weakness we have as a country is that we do not think. We are very smart when it comes to making money by doing our work but we do not apply critical intellect to\u2026 and these guys just take the entire country for a ride.\n\n\u201cGive me a president from any part of the country who can deliver and we should vote for him. He is not taking the presidency to his hometown.\u201d\n\nSanusi said civil society organisations and the national assembly \u201care not doing their jobs\u201d in terms of holding political society to account.\n\nEveryone wants office; everyone wants favours from the government. If we had a strong civil society holding political society to account, we would begin to improve and tackle issues,\u201d said the former CBN governor.\n\nNigeria Better Together Than Divided\n\nOn those agitating for the breakup of Nigeria, Sanusi said Nigeria \u201cis better together than divided,\u201d pointing out that countries that embraced dismemberment had found themselves in various conflicts and blamed the elites for using ethnicity and other factors to divide the country for their selfish gains.\n\nSanusi, who said he was a strong believer in a strong united Nigeria, believes that \u201conce the problem of leadership is addressed,\u201d most of the right decisions taken, and the system cleaned up of corruption, things would take a postive turn.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou hardly find a country that is homogenous and the same is with Nigeria,; that is why we are better together because if you try to divide the country, it will lead to further divisions and war like you have in Ethiopia and South Sudan.\u201d\n\nHe pointed at the North, West, East, Niger Delta and Middle Belt, which were all not homogenous and asked, \u201cHow many parts are you going to divide this country to ensure it is homogenous? The challenge is not in our diversity, the challenge is in the inability of the leadership to forge a nation.\n\n\u201cWe got out of a civil war and we are yet to start thinking like one country where people believe we are one. What happens is that from time to time we tend to have people in certain circles that see Nigeria as a place for extraction of rent and corruption.\n\n\u201cYou have different class factions of the elite who profit from creating a stage for themselves. If you have a northern president, how does that affect a poor northerner who is unemployed? If you have a southern president, how does it affect the common man in the south? It may benefit just a few from that zone\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer in Nigeria and I feel we are better off as one country than a divided country. 70 per cent of our problems are from wrong-headed policies.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Friday urged former President Goodluck Jonathan to remain in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and resist the temptation of joining the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAccording to Wike, who spoke in an interview on BBC News Pidgin, the PDP is a better political platform for the ex-President to run for the 2023 Presidency if he chooses to.\n\nWike warned Jonathan not to be enticed by moves by the APC to lure reputable members of the PDP, adding that the ruling party is offering nothing but destruction.\n\n\u201cIf I see the former President, I will tell him what I heard. I will tell him, \u2018Don\u2019t go anywhere because these people want to destroy your reputation. They don\u2019t like you; you should know.\n\n\u201cWhat APC is doing now is to bring reputable people from PDP, and when they bring them, they destroy them so that they won\u2019t have anywhere to go again. That\u2019s what the APC is doing.\n\n\u201cI respect the former President because he is a man of integrity but if I am to advise him, I will tell him, \u2018Sir, don\u2019t make that mistake. If you want to run for President, run under PDP. Nigerians cherish you more than this government. They have seen that all the things the (Buhari) government promised them are lies. So, please don\u2019t join the APC for the sake of your reputation.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe (Jonathan) has the right to decide whatever he wants to do but like I said before, if my former President runs for President in APC, I won\u2019t be able to vote for APC in the election because that would be anti-party but if he runs in PDP, I will work to ensure he wins the election,\u201d Wike said.\n\nJonathan lost his reelection in 2015 to Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThough out of Aso Rock, Jonathan has been working closely with the incumbent in his role as Special Envoy of the Economic Community of West African States.\n\nWith the 2023 elections fast approaching and the clamour for power shift to the South, Jonathan, who has the legal right to one more term as Nigeria\u2019s President as the constitution permits all eligible Nigerians to be in office for two terms of eight years, has been receiving entreaties from the APC.\n\nSome APC chieftains had visited him in recent times, raising the stakes in permutations for the 2023 general elections.\n\nOf late, with the wave of defections swinging in the direction of the ruling party, the National Secretary, APC Caretaker, and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, recently said Jonathan would be given an opportunity to contest the 2023 presidency on APC platform \u201cif he chose to join the ruling party.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former President is yet to respond to the entreaties.\n\nBennett Oghifo",
