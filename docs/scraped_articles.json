          "text": ".\n\n\u2026We\u2019re producing a generation of illiterate children \u2013 Alarmed Benue govt\n\nBy Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nBenue State is currently home to over 1.5 million Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, who are holed-up and scattered in various camps and host communities in parts of the state with children accounting for close to 50 per cent of that figure.\n\nAccording to findings, over 80 per cent of the displaced children were at various levels of schooling in their respective communities when they were sacked from their ancestral homes by marauding herdsmen.\n\nThe implication is that aside from being chased out of their homes, these children were forced out of school after fleeing with their parents and guardians from the communities and taking refuge in IDP camps and host communities.\n\nConsequently, from January of 2018 till date, the majority of these children have had to live in IDP camps, idling away without any form of schooling after their education was truncated by the invaders.\n\nThough the state government, with the support of its partners, has had to provide temporary learning arrangements for the displaced children in some of the camps including that of Abagena in the outskirts of Makurdi and the Shelter Camp in Daudu, Guma Local Government Area, LGA.\n\nThat intervention, though laudable, has not been able to tackle the gaps that have been created in the lives of these children.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nThe Almajiri Catastrophe in Northern Nigeria\n\nAnd today Benue is warehousing an army of helpless out-of-school-children in IDP camps.\n\nFindings indicated that outside Abagena and Shelter camps, the children that are taking refuge in most of the camps learn under trees in a makeshift learning environment set up through self-help in a bid to give the children some sense of attending school.\n\nThe improvised learning arrangement in the camps, which were put in place by the inmates themselves, though intended to avail the children some sense of learning will eventually serve no useful purpose if a well laid out and structured learning environment run by qualified personnel is not put in place to get the children to reconnect to proper learning and teaching environment.\n\nShade\n\nA picture of the situation in these camps was painted by the Camp Manager of Tse Uikpam IDP camp in Guma LGA, Mr. Matthew Asaaga, who told Sunday Vanguard that parents, on their own, mobilize and gather their children daily under the shade of one of the big trees in the camp to be taught by volunteers.\n\n\u201cSomebody who is a retired teacher volunteered to be the headmaster of the under tree school\u201d, Asaaga said.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement they have put in place is to have individuals in the camp including educated persons to assist in teaching the children.\n\n\u201cWe give them materials and people also volunteer teaching materials and any day they exhaust the materials they have the children would not be taught.\n\n\u201cIt is not a properly structured teaching arrangement but it gives the children that sense of being in school while sitting on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that this arrangement is quite challenging because all the children, irrespective of their ages and classes, gather under the big tree and receive lessons when the proper thing to do is to segregate them according to their ages and classes, and teach them accordingly.\n\n\u201cBut in this case, how can you do that when you do not have the materials in a classroom arrangement and the trained teachers to impact knowledge on the children.\n\n\u201cSo we are just doing this for the fun of it because it is just an ad-hoc arrangement to give the children some sense of being in school pending when a school is put in place for them or they return to their communities.\u201d\n\nCoordinate\n\nOn his part, the headmaster of the school, and father of eight children, who is also an IDP, Mr. James Nyitar, said he volunteered to coordinate the teaching of the children as a retired teacher \u201cto help keep the children focused and on track ahead of when they would eventually return to a proper school or a school is set up in the camp.\n\n\u201cIt has not been an easy task I must confess because the children gather in the morning and sit on the floor. Also, we only get materials when anybody donates them to us.\n\n\u201cMoreover whenever it rains we will not hold lessons that day because it is under a tree that we gather and that is only meant to protect us from the sun and not rain.\n\n\u201cBut on the whole what we are doing is more like wetting the appetite of the children ahead of having them return to a formal school but it is quite challenging because people volunteer to teach them and what that means is that you might not have that commitment from them and given that the arrangement is an in house thing more or less\u201d.\n\nOutcry\n\nThis situation accounted for the recent outcry by the Benue State government following the alarm raised by the Special Adviser to Benue State Governor on SDGs and NEPAD and Chairman Technical Committee on Benue State Humanitarian Response Plan, BSHRP, Prof. Magdalene Dura, when her team presented a plan out to Governor Samuel Ortom for onward presentation to the public.\n\nDura had raised concern that the state was producing a generation of illiterate children as a result of the activities of armed herdsmen in the state and the consequent displacement of families and resultant humanitarian crisis.\n\nShe stated that in the last five years, most of Benue\u2019s children had been out of school and living in IDP camps.\n\nHer words: \u201cFrom 2011 to the end of 2021, 21 of the 23 Local Government Areas of the state came under attacks by armed herdsmen, leading to the displacement of over 1.5 million people.\n\n\u201cAside from the herdsmen induced humanitarian crisis, Benue State is also besieged by nature-induced humanitarian disasters like flooding.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the most worrisome is that Benue is producing a generation of illiterates as most of our children, in the last five years, are out of school and are in the camps\u201d.\n\nAnd bothered by the situation of children in Benue IDP camp and the urgent need to address the rising figure of out-of-school-children in the state, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, promised to commence the construction of Temporary Learning Centers, TLCs, in IDP camps in the state to provide enabling learning environment for displaced children in the camps.\n\nThis was disclosed by the outgoing UNICEF Chief of Enugu Field Office, Dr Ibrahim Conteh when he paid a farewell visit to the Tse Uikpam IDP camp.\n\nHe explained that the TLCs to be set up at the Uikpam camp would be a temporary school structure that would accommodate about 500 to 600 pupils and furnished with chairs and desks to ensure comfort for the children.\n\nConteh said: \u201cWe already have the budget and we are doing the contracting process now.\n\n\u201cMaybe in the next two weeks, they will start erecting the Temporary Learning Centers.\n\n\u201cIt is not really a permanent school, it is a semi-permanent school to give opportunity to children not to sit under the trees to learn but to sit in a proper classroom.\n\n\u201cWe will also be providing desks and chairs to ensure that these children have a proper learning environment.\n\n\u201cFor now, we only have funding for this (Uikpam) camp and we are planning to put two big units so that we can have between 500 and 600 children in there. But we are also still looking for more funding.\n\n\u201cAs we get more funding we will continue to do more. So, this is not the end. This is just the start.\n\n\u201cAt least, they can have a place to go to school and we will continue to address their needs as we have the resources\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2022Bello, Umahi, Ngige, Fayemi, Fashola too\n\n\u2022\u2018How Abba Kyari\u2019s death altered permutations for Geoffrey Onyeama\u2019\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nBarely twelve months to the 2023 general elections in the country, there is high-level strategic lobbying by ambitious politicians, especially those touted to be close allies of President Muhammadu Buhari and with the strong desire to succeed him as Nigeria\u2019s next President.\n\nThe development has led to maneuvering, intrigues, eye service and hero worshiping as those eyeing the presidential seat lobby the high brass and the political cabals and their agents that decide who occupies the coveted number one seat of the land after Buhari.\n\nOf late, the seat of power, otherwise known as the Aso Rock, has become a Mecca of sort as those angling to become the next President have been coming to court Buhari for his blessings if not to be adopted as the anointed candidate.\n\nIt was reliably gathered that the death of the immediate past Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, has thrown the race open.\n\nA source close to the late \u2018Power House of the Villa\u2019 had claimed that Kyari\u2019s demise has, in a way, changed the political equation.\n\nThe source said that the thinking then was that the race for the presidential seat in 2023 will be arrangement between the North-East and the South-East as they are the two geopolitical zones that have yet to occupy the seat.\n\nUnder the arrangement, the former Chief of Staff was being positioned to take over from his principal while the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, a bosom friend of Kyari, was supposed to be the running mate and, after eight years, power will go to the South-East.\n\nHowever, that arrangement, if at all it existed as claimed, has become a thing of the past.\n\nThe question on the lips of many appointees of the President and some of the staff in the State House is, who will \u2018Baba\u2019 anoint as his successor?\n\nThe question is pertinent against the backdrop of the fact that Buhari should ordinarily be interested in who succeeds him for the sake of continuity of government programmes.\n\nWhile some of the appointees have been put under suspense on whom to pitch their tent with because the body language of the President has not given any green light on the direction to go, some persons who are close to Buhari have claimed that, going by his nature, he may not anoint anyone as he would prefer that all the aspirants pass through the democratic process in which the people will choose whoever they want.\n\nTo support this claim, the people said that the President has told whoever cares to listen to him to carry his cross as he attempted to be elected President for three times without success only to succeed at the fourth time in 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 10, 2022, the All Progressives Congress, APC, National Leader and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, opened the floodgate of consultations as he met with Buhari to inform him of his aspiration to contest for the presidential election slated for February 2023 by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nSome have also said that the visit was to ask for the President\u2019s support even though some power brokers within the Presidency have argued that the APC National Leader should continue to play the role of a kingmaker and not to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nIt was rumoured that some elements in the ruling APC are working hard to ensure the enthronement of the Lagos politician as the next President.\n\nHe had said that it has been his life ambition to be President.\n\nDave Umahi\n\nLess than 24 hours after Tinubu\u2019s visit, the governor of Ebonyi State, Mr Dave Umahi, also went to meet the President to inform him of his intention to contest for the presidency in 2023 on the platform of the APC.\n\nUmahi was elected as governor in 2015 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and re-elected on the same platform in 2019, but he dumped the party for the APC in November 2020, claiming that PDP had not been fair to the South-East.\n\nThe Ebonyi governor said that despite the support the South-East had given to the PDP, it was against natural justice that the party should contemplate zoning its presidential ticket outside the region.\n\nSome people have suggested that Umahi was propelled to visit Buhari a day after the APC National Leader made his ambition known to Mr. President.\n\nIt was gathered that the Ebonyi governor is in the good books of some persons in the Presidency and it is expected that he will be among those to be presented to Buhari for consideration.\n\nRochas Okorocha\n\nAPC stalwart and one of the founding members of the APC, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, is another aspirant who has presented his 2023 presidential ambition to Buhari.\n\nThe immediate past governor of Imo State and current senator representing Imo West visited the seat of power last week to tell the President that he is interested in taking over from him next year. Okorocha, like President Buhari, has been a regular aspirant and it is not certain yet whether he has a lobby group that will convince the President on why he should be considered as his (successor).\n\nThe \u2018iberiberism\u2019 proponent has friends from the North but is in fierce battle with his successor, Governor Hope Uzodimma, over who controls the APC structure in the state.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo\n\nAlso in contention is Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who is being projected by some APC elements to succeed his boss.\n\nAlthough he hasn\u2019t publicly declared his interest in the job, some have argued that the law professor and Pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, has the necessary prerequisite to take over from his boss having undergone tutelage for eight years.\n\nIt was gathered that some powerful forces from the North, including a former Director General of a Federal Government agency, are at the forefront of the Osinbajo for President project.\n\nWhereas the body language of President has never suggested that he is supporting anybody, some people have said that Buhari may be comfortable to handover to his Vice President.\n\nBut it is not clear yet whether Osinbajo will contest the 2023 presidency or not despite the ongoing consultations organized by various support groups urging him to run.\n\nA report last week that the Vice President will declare his ambition to contest for the presidential election after the APC\u2019s Convention was quickly dismissed by his spokesperson, saying the law professor has never made any pronouncement on when he is going to declare his ambition.\n\nSome people have even alleged that there is a cold war going on between Osinbajo\u2019s supporters and those of Tinubu.\n\nRecall that it was Tinubu who nominated Osinbajo as Buhari\u2019s running mate in 2015 after it became clear that he (Tinubu) couldn\u2019t run with then presidential candidate of the APC (Buhari) because of the widespread opposition to Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nFor now it has not been made public whether Osinbajo, like other aspirants, has informed Buhari of nursing any ambition but sources in the Villa told Sunday Vanguard that his promoters have apparently been making a case for him.\n\nThe slightest hint yet that the VP could be preparing to take a shot at the 2023 presidency is the public declaration of a close aide that he would not support Tinubu\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nYahaya Bello\n\nEqually believed to be nursing presidential bid ahead of 2023 is a friend of the Villa and the first family, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. Unconfirmed report say Bello ascended the Kogi governorship throne on the instrumentality of the first family.\n\nSome have further contended that some of his loyalists have taken his ambition to the Presidency.\n\nIt is not yet made public whether his aspiration has gotten the blessing of the President but he is not relenting in ensuring a fait accompli for the project. For now, he has not officially visited to announce his ambition at the State House.\n\nSenator Ngige\n\nSenator Chris Ngige, a serving Minister of Labour and Employment, is among cabinet members some persons within the Presidency believe have performed well.\n\nHis access to Buhari has made political pundits to conclude that he is very close to the President.\n\nThe former Anambra State governor and medical doctor by training has declared that he would make his presidential ambition known in April after consultations with his political friends and associates.\n\nMost of his meetings with Buhari are held behind closed-doors, so, it has not been made public whether he may be the anointed candidate the President mentioned about when he granted television interview recently. Recall that Buhari had declined to mention his preferred candidate, saying that revealing the identity of the person might lead to the person\u2019s elimination.\n\nHowever, within the labour circle, some leaders have extolled the sterling qualities of the Anambra APC leader.\n\nSome of the labour leaders urged Ngige to contest for the presidency in 2023.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nA former governor of Rivers State and Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, has been rumoured in some quarters as the President\u2019s preferred candidate, in fact the anointed candidate to take over from him in 2023.\n\nAlthough there has not been any display from the President to that effect, sources within the Presidency claim that the odds appear to favour him.\n\nOnly last weekend, he was conferred with a chieftaincy title (Dan Amanar Daura, meaning Trusted Son of Daura) by the Daura Emirate of Katsina State, the President home town.\n\nThe title has been interpreted in different quarters to mean, \u2018The Preferred\u2019, \u2018The Trustworthy\u2019 and \u2018The Face of Nigeria\u2019s Future\u2019.\n\nThis has increased the speculation that Amaechi is the APC anointed candidate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAgain, Amaechi, who was Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum, NGF, when he was governor, was hosted by the First Lady, Dr. Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, after the conferment of the Daura chieftaincy title on him. The Minister was accompanied by his wife, Judith Amaechi, during the First Lady\u2019s visit.\n\nBabatunde Fashola\n\nAlso in reckoning as a potential successor to Buhari is the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola. The minister is said to be among those that get Mr. President\u2019s attention at any given time. A Presidency source said that if the President has the sole right to appoint his successor, Fashola will be one of those to be considered. However, the former Lagos State governor has not openly indicated interest in the presidential race.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nAnother person that appears to be admired by the President is the governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi. The former Minister of Mines and Steel Development, some analysts claim, has the aura and potentials to take over from Buhari. Even though the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum is always spotted with the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee and governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, the Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu and the governor of Jigawa state, Mohammed Badaru, he has not formally declared whether he has the ambition to contest the presidential poll next year. Incidentally Fayemi has few months to complete his second term in office.\n\nSuspense\n\nAs the lobby continues, the President is keeping his followers and party members in suspense on whoever is likely going to succeed him.\n\nBut one thing is certain: May 29, 2023 is the exit date for him and someone, possibly one of those mentioned in this report, will succeed him.\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",
          "summary": "Rochas OkorochaAPC stalwart and one of the founding members of the APC, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, is another aspirant who has presented his 2023 presidential ambition to Buhari.\nOkorocha, like President Buhari, has been a regular aspirant and it is not certain yet whether he has a lobby group that will convince the President on why he should be considered as his (successor).\nBut it is not clear yet whether Osinbajo will contest the 2023 presidency or not despite the ongoing consultations organized by various support groups urging him to run.\nRecall that it was Tinubu who nominated Osinbajo as Buhari\u2019s running mate in 2015 after it became clear that he (Tinubu) couldn\u2019t run with then presidential candidate of the APC (Buhari) because of the widespread opposition to Muslim-Muslim ticket.\nThis has increased the speculation that Amaechi is the APC anointed candidate in the 2023 presidential election.",

          "text": "By Ozioruva Aliu\n\nLeaders of seven communities in Edo State have called on the state government and security agencies to save them from those they termed criminal herdsmen terrorising them.\n\nThey lamented that their areas have been besieged by the herders who they accused of kidnapping, killing, raping and destroying their farms.\n\nThe affected places in Orhionmwon Local Government Area include Ologbo-nugu, Umoghun-nokhua, Orogho, Owuo, Urhehue, Evboesi and Evbonogbon.\n\nThey are at the border of Edo and Delta states by River Ethiope, off Benin-Abraka Road. The people lamented that their farmlands have also been destroyed by the herdsmen.\n\nNarrating his experience to Sunday Vanguard, a victim, Gaius Osifo, who hails from Evboesi, said his three farms were destroyed, saying he can no longer access them for fear of being killed by the herders.\n\nOsifo said, \u201cOn January after the New Year celebration, I decided to go to my farm. \u201cI went with bamboo to work in my barns.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived, I discovered that the herdsmen had destroyed the yams I harvested. \u201cI had to quickly take my motorcycle and ran back to the village so that I wouldn\u2019t be attacked.\n\n\u201cThey could have killed me. I went home to tell my people what had happened. \u201cThe next day, I went with other farmers to the farms to gather what was left. We reported the matter to our Enogie, Duke. \u201cEver since the incident happened, we have not been going to the farm. They ate the tubers of yam. \u201cAnd the ones they did not eat, they cut them into pieces. I now find it difficult to feed and don\u2019t have money since I cannot harvest anything to sell.\n\n\u201cThere was a time we drove all the herdsmen in Evboesi away and I believe this set came from a neighbouring community or Delta State. \u201cThey ate our plantains and other cash crops.\n\nPolice\n\n\u201cSince I was born, I have never seen this kind of thing in our farms. My father cultivated here for many years before I took over after his death. \u201cI don\u2019t know who brought these herdsmen. For now, I only pray to God to help us as nobody can go to the farm to harvest plantain.\n\n\u201cNobody can harvest cassava to make garri. We have abandoned the remaining crops that we are yet to harvest. \u201cI went to Abudu to report to the police, but they said I should go to Ugo to also report to the police there. \u201cI showed them the pictures of the destroyed farm and crops. The police promised to call me, but I have not heard from them. \u201cWe want government to come to our aid and provide security. The crops they destroyed in my farm are over N3m.\u201d\n\nIn a save our soul letter to Governor Godwin Obaseki, the people said they are scared for their lives.\n\nThey said herdsmen now threaten their ancestral homes. The letter was signed by 12 elders from the seven communities. They include Nathaniel Ogbemudia, Ologbo-nugu, Charles Aghavbere, Ologbo-nugu, Okoro Nelson Okuonghae, Edward Omomagiowawi, Umoghun-Nokhua, Christopher Aisagbonbu ,Umoghun-Nokhua, Victor Levels Urhehue and Osaro Lease.\n\nOthers are Victor Onoko ,Evbonogbon, Friday Egbon, Evbonogbon, Alex Eko, Friday Omoruyi and Chief Johnbull Evbenobose.\n\nFour years\n\nIn the letter, they said: \u201cOur farmlands from centuries ago spread from Benin-Abraka Road to Ugo- Oben \u2013 Jesse Road, all under Ugo and Iguelaba police divisions. For about four years now, some fierce-looking herdsmen accompanied by AK47- wielding teenagers have invaded our farmlands with hundreds of cattle. \u201cThey destroyed our crops and fed their cattle with our produce comprising yams, plantains, cassava and more.\n\n\u201cWe took pains to identify the owner of the cattle whom we found to be a Fulani merchant based in Warri. \u201cIn our latest contact with him, he disowned the cattle and herders now in our farms, insisting that they are cattle rustlers with stolen cattle from Kogi State. \u201cHe said he has since taken away his herders and cattle from our neighbourhood, adding that those now terrorising us are common criminals.\n\n\u201cHe said he has since complained at Ugo Police Division that the herdsmen currently terrorising us are common criminals. \u201cHe advised us to cry to the government to comb the bush with a joint military team and flush out the bandits.\n\nBandits\n\n\u201cWe are now forced to cry to our governor as the bandits have started killing our people, raping our wives and daughters.\n\n\u201cLate January 2022, they killed a father and his 3 children at Evbonogbon Their bodies are still in the mortuary.\n\n\u201cOn February 2, 2022, they abducted three women from Ologbo-nugu, tortured and raped them serially.\n\n\u201cThey released them with a warning to their husbands that they will be coming to wipe out the various communities soon.\n\n\u201cSince then, we have sighted them at different points spying on our communities.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, February 3, they abducted seven other women from Evbonogbon and treated them exactly as they treated the three from Ologbo as narrated above.\n\n\u201cNow we are afraid to enter our old farms to harvest or start cultivating new farms. There are several other victims.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Friday, January 4th, the gallant vigilante team of Ologbo-nugu stormed the occupied farmland and arrested one of the bandits that raped their women.\n\n\u201cThe arrested bandit has been handed over to Edo State Police Command and he has confessed to the crime, but refused to name members of his gang or show us where they hide their weapons, which he initially volunteered to do.\n\n\u201cHence we are crying to our governor to order his Joint Military Task Force to lead our vigilante groups to comb the area and flush out the criminals from our land before they kill more law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

More so that we are really preparing to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the school.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, during our time there nobody discriminated on religious lines. Both Christians and Muslims were allowed to practice their faith.\n\n\u201cBut when you look at the political terrain of Nigeria now, all interests are based on politics.\n\n\u201cCome to think of it, the row is not really religion. There is some element of politics on the whole issue. We need to be extremely careful the ways and manner we resolve disputes. We need to eschew sensitive utterances.\n\n\u201cGovernment has issued out a policy that does not go down well with a certain faith, despite that we need to dialogue and look at the way the policy could be reversed so that peace will reign again.\n\n\u201cI am more concerned is that we had some issues in the community before hijab incident\u2013 because I am from Ijagbo.\n\nPeace was just returning before this came up again. The hijab controversy has further polarised the community along religious line.\n\n\u201cNo government will succeed where there is peace. Government should therefore weigh the options and bring challenge in our hand to peaceful resolution in record time.\n\n\u201cAs we speak now the school is under lock and key. The students are the ones losing.\u201d\n\nLending his voice, one of the former teachers of the school Alhaji Ibiyeye B Razaq, said that the hijab palaver in the school was unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe incident is an unfortunate one. I don\u2019t think that we should not quarrel over the issue of religion. I mean nobody can defend God.\n\n\u201cI am not happy that it went to the extent that the school would be shut.\n\n\u201cAll through my stay in the school and the time it was closed down that kind of a thing did not happen.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to the government and for the sake of our children\u2013 the leaders of tomorrow that they should please get the school open,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the award, the former mathematics teacher said \u201cI am happy. When I saw the invite honestly I was surprised because it was 38 years ago.\n\nAnd students that we were beating in those days can still remember to call and give us awards.

          "text": "Some Nigerians have been complaining about improper activities of \u201cloan sharks\u201d who offer them unsolicited loan facilities only to start harassing them when there is delay in repayment.\n\nFindings by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reveal that these loan sharks are mostly fintech companies that offer loans at high rate returns, strict terms of collection upon failure, and generally operate outside the law.\n\nSome of the fintech companies involved in loan offerings include Sokoloan, Gocash, Getcash, Fastmoney, Cashlion, and Lcash.\n\nThey mostly charge high interest rate and service charge. They also give small amounts of money and short period of repayment, and most borrowers usually default in payment due to these conditions.\n\nAccording to one borrower, Isaac Aliu, some of these lenders take extreme and unacceptable steps to recover their money.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cImagine the situation where an agent is posting an imaginary obituary of a defaulter. That is an extreme action and should be met with heavy sanction.\n\n\u201cI still wonder why they take these drastic actions without the knowledge of authorities like CBN.\n\n\u201cSomeone committed suicide recently because of this kind of embarrassment. It is better this loan apps get banned or subjected to strict regulation, \u201d he said.\n\nMatthew Oba narrated how one of the companies defamed him, even after repayment of his loan.\n\n\u201cI took a loan of N6000 from (one of the loan companies). They sent defamatory messages to all my contacts even after repayment have been made.\n\n\u201cThey are so quick in taking drastic actions by posting ones pictures to contacts which was not part of the agreement.\n\n\u201cThey are worse than shylocks. They act polite when calling someone to take their loans only for them to become wild when it is time to pay back.\n\n\u201cTheir mode of operation is fraudulent because most times the interest they charge is more than the one in their agreements,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother borrower, speaking on condition of anonymity, bemoaned the death of his relative due to harassment by some of the loan sharks.\n\n\u201cMy brother committed suicide in January due to harassment. Another defamatory notification dropped on his phone by CreditAll, I wonder how many more.\n\n\u201cThey could have called the guarantor instead of all the contacts,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ayoade Babatunde, a Chartered Accountant, some of the fintechs offering such loans are usually in breach of certain regulations.\n\n\u201cThey breach the third party protection policy, thereby taking Laws into their hands without notifying the right authorities.\n\n\u201cThey engage in defamation of character , which is likened to cyber bullying and have led to mental disability, emotional trauma and even death in some cases.\n\n\u201cThey impose excessive interest rates , which have increased poverty levels of many of their victims, \u201d he said.\n\nHe called for a decisive regulatory action to curb excesses of these loan sharks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has warned Nigerians to desist from accepting loans offer from such companies.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, gave the warning during the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nEmefiele explained that those who go to collect loans from places other than microfinance banks or recognised institutions are at bigger risk.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for you to go to loan sharks for a loan. People normally go to loan sharks because they are desperate and can\u2019t access the bank.\n\n\u201cWe found out that those that are vulnerable are households who need money to do their businesses but they cannot access bank finance.\n\n\u201cAs a result they go to loan sharks who charge them way above the amount borrowed and expected to pay back in 90 days and if that does not happen, they seize your house or bikes.\n\n\u201cWe can only continue to advise that there is no need to go for loan sharks,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele urged Nigerians to take advantage of the various avenues put in place by the apex bank to access credit.\n\n\u201cThe CBN has put in place the avenue through which you can raise your finance, like through the targeted credit facility or the SMEs loan that was set up through our microfinance banks.\n\n\u201cYou do not have to know anybody, just go to the portal and fill the form, send your data, and if it is correct, you will be able to access loans,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that several people have benefited from the microfinance strategy to give out loans at affordable rates, adding that CBN would go after loan sharks.\n\n\u201cThe CBN is putting effort to stop loan sharks, and when these people are found, they will be dealt with mercilessly,\u201d he assured.\n\n(NAN)",

This followed the arrest of Aliu Salami, 43, with 143.9kg cannabis at Oke-Ata, Abeokuta South LGA, Ogun state on Wednesday 9th Feb.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, not even a bunch of talisman (charms) used by a trans-border drug dealer, Shu\u2019aibu Salisu could save him and his gang as their consignment of 578kg of Cannabis meant for Niger Republic was intercepted in Kwara state on 8th Feb when two persons: Gambo Lawal and Ibrahim Mohammed were arrested while conveying the drug to someone in Charanchi, Katsina State.

          "title": "How Igboho, Kanu can be released \u2013 Dansudu, National President,",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nNational President of Arewa United Consultative Forum, AUCF, Alhaji Shuaibu Ado Dansudu, has urged Nigerians to place emphasis on competence and credibility in making their choice of who rules the country next and bother less about where the person hails from.\n\nThe Arewa leader noted that the Igbo, just like every other section of the country, is eminently qualified to lead the country.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nBut he expressed reservation about what he termed Igbo\u2019s wrong approach in the race for the 2023 presidency.\n\nIn this interview, Dansudu spoke more on the ordeals of separatist leaders, Sunday Ighoho and Nnamdi Kanu whose freedom he said may not entirely lie with the Federal Government. Excerpt:\n\nLeaders of thoughts in the North recently dismissed the call for power shift to the South. Do you think this is fair?\n\nThis is politics where every individual and group are entitled to their own opinion more so because we are in a democracy. They have their reasons for expressing such view. But what matters to me and what I think should matter to every Nigerian is not where the next president comes from. Rather we should be concerned about electing a credible and competent person as the next president. As far as the person has what it takes to move Nigeria forward; as far as the person can unite the nation and help build our economy, where the person hails from should not bother us. It is not our fault that we find ourselves in this situation; it is the fault of the colonial masters who put us in this mess. They did it intentionally because they didn\u2019t want us to live as one people. But then I need to say that Nigeria does not want a new driver in the saddle. What we need is an experienced person who is versed in the system. We know those who fought for democracy in this country and we need to compensate them. Look at the short period Yar\u2019Adua spent as the president of this country, he did perfectly well because he was not a neophyte in the system. He was a governor and understood governance. So, we need somebody who is already in the system \u2013 not a learner. Then, there is also the need to reciprocate the good that has been done to you. You must support a person who supports you. I am not saying it is compulsory power should come to the South, but if the North wants to be fair, northerners should support Tinubu because of his support for the North in the past. Besides that we all know what Tinubu achieved in Lagos State even when the state was starved of fund by the Federal Government.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWhat then do you to say to those calling for Igbo presidency in 2023? This is one ethnic group that is yet to have a shot at power since the return to civil rule, a factor, which is central to their claim of marginalization?\n\nThe Igbo have the right to rule Nigeria just like every other ethnic group, but the problem with the Igbo, however, is their approach to seeking power. The activity of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, in the recent years is a major cause for concern. When it started in the Southwest, the leaders in the zone stepped in quickly and successfully nipped it in the bud. I don\u2019t doubt the ability of Igbo leaders to rein in these people, but we are yet to see that happening. As it stands, we don\u2019t really know why the problem festers. We don\u2019t know whether it is because Igbo leaders are in support of the group or it is because they lack the capacity to tame them. The group has been accused of all manners of criminalities- killing, assassinating, terrorizing their people. Everybody is afraid of what is going to happen if they are given the opportunity to rule the country. No matter how just the cause you are fighting, taking up arms against the country is not the solution. South Africa is a good example of country whose people were dealt with unjustly but the people did not succumb to the temptation of picking up arms. That was why they had the kind of support they had before they triumphed. You cannot continue killing, ordering your people to stay at home and causing all sorts of unrests and expect the people to listen to you and sympathise with you. These are some of the reasons people may be having a second thought on the issue of Igbo presidency. I do not subscribe to the sentiment that the Igbo are marginalized. There is no way one ethnic group out of three major ethnic groups should be allowed to take everything. The North is strong in politics and that gives us the edge when it comes to seeking and wielding power. When you look at government\u2019s parastatals, ministries, the Southwest has a hold there. The economy is controlled by the Igbo. Beyond this, the South has enjoyed democratic rule more than the North. Obasanjo ruled for eight years, Jonathan spent six years. Yar\u2019Adua only spent two years; it is only Buhari that has the opportunity of ruling for eight years. So, as far as I am concerned, there are just two divisions in the country: the North and the South. Whenever anybody emerges as president in the North, the South is always quick to tag the person as a northerner forgetting that there are three geo-political zones in the North. But if it is from the South, that is when you will hear that the person is from Southwest or South-south or Southeast. The Southerners must begin to see themselves as one. The Igbo has not demonstrated enough commitment to rule this country. These are people whose majority believe they are Biafrans, and not Nigerians. So, what exactly do the Igbo want? Igbo must drop their agitation first and see themselves as Nigerians. That will serve as the first indication that they are ready to rule Nigeria.\n\nHow best do you think the continued detention of Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu, two separatist agitators, can be resolved with the Federal Government?\n\nThe struggle of Sunday Igboho should not be compared to that of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t have enough evidence to disprove the claim by security agents that they found some arms in Igboho\u2019s house, but what I know is that Sunday Igboho\u2019s supporters did not go wild on the streets to unleash violence and disturb the peace of their people the way IPOB is doing in the Southeast. The only issue I have with Igboho is that he personalized the fight against the Fulani. He should have partnered with security agents. That is why Igboho failed. Look at the reaction of Yoruba leaders, how they handled and managed the crisis and compare it to the situation in the Southeast. I don\u2019t think the solution lies totally with the Federal Government. The people will have to initiate the peace move. If today, IPOB decides to lay down their arms and allow peace to reign, the government will be willing to release Kanu because his supporters will be able to convince the government that the tension generated in the zone will fizzle out. But if the government today, accedes to the call to release Kanu without IPOB convincing us that they are ready to drop their arms, do you think that will stop the tension in that zone? No! It will not. On the other hand, Igboho can be released, but then you have to remember that he is not in the government\u2019s custody. So, you can see why I said the solution to their ordeals is not entirely with the government.\n\nPresident Buhari has refused to openly align with the political ambition of any of those craving to succeed him. What do you make of the president\u2019s neutrality?\n\nThat is what a good father should do even if he has a favourite among the contenders. He should not make it known to the rest of them. If he does that the rest will gang up against the anointed contender. It is not yet time to show his support for anyone of them. Apart from creating problems for the anointed aspirant, the president himself will face a lot of problems should he make open show of his support for his favourite among them. We all know the story of Jacob and Joseph. Jacob\u2019s open display of affection for Joseph ahead of his other siblings put him into troubles. So, President Buhari must avoid Jacob\u2019s pitfall now to protect his Joseph. He may show it later; not now.",

          "title": "Money ritual: Anxiety over growing national evil",
          "text": "By Cosmas Omegoh, Kunle Olafioye (Lagos), Tony Osauzo, Ighomuaye Lucky (Benin), and Laide Raheem, (Abeokuta)\n\nThere is no pretence anymore. Nigeria has never been at such crossroads as another monster of gargantuan size and stature \u2013 ritual killing for money \u2013 bulldozes its way into the national psyche, staring every one in the face. It has the dimension of a national malaise. Denying this evil is awful, fruitless and needless. That is the reality many are now slowly, but regrettably beginning to acknowledge.\n\nOver the past years, abduction of people has been on the rise. Some individuals simply vanished without any trace. A few who managed to return home alive have told nightmarish and unbelievable tales of what they saw in camps where they were taken to. There, victims were dismembered right before their own eyes in such a gruesomely mindless orgy, leaving their blood streaming down in rivulets. Their essential parts were chopped off there and then, and kept away for customer who needed them.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nAt the centre of this burgeoning human parts trade are men and women who prepare charms to enable them make money they did not work for. When they cannot buy already-harvested parts, they abduct their victims, kill them, and later discard their remains. Then in collaboration with their juju doctors, they proceed to use what they have for \u201cmoney rituals,\u201d as it is now called in street parlance. How that works, remains a mystery that might take science an age to unravel.\n\nAccording to Sunday Sun investigation, this \u201cmoney ritual\u2019 now making Nigeria and Nigerians edgy didn\u2019t start yesterday. It was birthed as Internet scam. Growing like a weevil, it began gnawing at the fabrics of the Nigerian society, gradually forcing things to give way, allowing them to fall apart steadily. Many did not notice. Those who did merely waved away the crime, leaving things unattended to, unaddressed. Now, it has gathered pace.\n\nSome people believe \u201cmoney ritual\u201d has already attained a menace of epidemic proportion, spreading far faster than ever imagined, treacherously threatening the real existence of the Nigerian society now in distress.\n\nSunday Sun learnt that the involvement of a band of desperate, unrelenting youths is worrisome. They go by the name \u201cYahoo, Yahoo,\u201d boys. Many of them are graduates from the various tertiary institutions. Even barely literate ones who only know that the evil trade fetches money are joining in their droves.\n\nOur correspondent further learnt that in the beginning, the Yahoo Yahoo boys who were majorly Internet fraudsters were mainly coning, and scamming the unsuspecting ones \u2013 both Nigerians and foreigners. But gradually the tempo of their ill began to wane. Many had begun to know both their tactics and their antics. So gradually they shifted to the next level \u2013 using human blood to make money. That is their new frightening platform. They hypnotise their victims sort of, and cause them to be under an influence they cannot explain and begin to do their bidding. That they now call \u201cYahoo Plus.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Yahoo Plus boys kill their victims and use them for money rituals. They target their parents, sibling, friends and neighbours. It is either they drag their victims to a juju doctor, or do so through a remote spiritual means or kill them by themselves. There are some who do assorted things that nauseate. Once things go as they planned, in no time, the Yahoo Plus chap is already super rich, reeling in wealth.\n\nNow, in their blind quest for money, some are told to either eat their own feaces, or make love to their parents or do such weird and discomforting stuffs that provoke humanity to revolt. Not many saw this bizarre act carried out for money sake coming. But it is here, and threatening to stay for as long as it is allowed to be.\n\nMoney ritual and NOA\n\nAccording to Paul Odenyi, assistant director, Press, at National Orientation Agency (NOA), Abuja, ritual killings and advance-fee fraud are considered a part of the general concept of value decay in the country.\n\n\u201cOne would think that the young generation, with their exposure and spread of religious faith, will have nothing to do with rituals. But what we are seeing shows that the youths and the whole society appear to be saying \u201canything that will give us money is worth trying.\u201d\n\nRitual killing, he said, \u201cis based on the belief that you can sacrifice human beings to make money. It is a wrong belief which the whole of society should rise against.\n\n\u201cJust like ritual killing, Yahoo boys are exploiting the rise in Internet economy to scam of people of their hard-earned wealth.\u201d\n\nLegislators raise the alarm\n\nDays ago, the House of Representatives raised the red flag, following the wanton killing of innocent citizens for ritual purposes mostly for money making.\n\nThe lower chamber wanted the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on the social vice now on the rise.\n\nIt tasked the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, and his officers to take proactive measures and up their surveillance and intelligence-gathering game so as to arrest and prosecute those involved in the evil.\n\nThe parliamentarians also tasked the National Orientation Agency (NOA), parents, schools, religious leaders as well as the media to begin campaigns to change the trend.\n\nThe pronouncements were sequel to a motion brought on the floor of the House by the Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu entitled: \u201cNeed to Curb the Rising Trend of Ritual Killings in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu was aghast that ritual killings had attained frightening heights in recent times.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Red Cross Society in 2017 reported that it received 10,480 reports of missing persons in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that \u201cmerchants of such wicked acts often use the social media as a ready tool to advertise their evil behaviours.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201csuch cruel and barbaric acts should no longer be promoted in our society, given the demands of today\u2019s world,\u201d declaring them as \u201cunacceptable norms.\u201d\n\nRitualists\u2019 recent activities\n\nMid last week, a video of Yahoo Yahoo boys emerged, showing them celebrating their exploits. In the viral video, some of them were pouring celebratory drinks on their phones, in the hope it would bring them fortune.\n\nAnother video also surfaced lately featuring youths who stormed a bank in Lagos wearing adult diapers. Witnesses reasoned that the youths were told that at the recitation of some incantations at the bank, either the staff or the ATM might begin to dispense money for them to collect.\n\nRecall that a fortnight ago, the Ogun State Police Command arrested one Majekodunmi Balogun, a 20-year-old, who confessed to collaborating with his friends to kill his girl friend, 18, for money ritual.\n\nThe young man was arrested alongside three other teenagers.\n\nIn Delta last year, a young man also killed his girl friend for ritual purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, the gruesome killing of a young woman, Iniubong Umoren, who was lured to a particular location in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State for a job interview, remains a sour point.\n\nIn Owerri, lately, a viral video of an alleged Yahoo Yahoo boy was seen. In the video, the man sitting on a potty was cleaning his anus with slices of bread and eating the same at a road media. Some people said the video was conjured, but that mirrors a social malaise spiraling out of hand.\n\nEFCC dealing with vice\n\nSome days ago, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), acknowledged that the Yahoo Yahoo boys were now adding a spiritual angle to their crime, vowing to sustain its onslaught against them.\n\nIn its Facebook page, EFCC lamented that the fraudsters had raised the stakes, but assured that it would not be business as usual as anyone caught in the act would pay the price.\n\n\u201cNo going back on the onslaught against Yahoo-yahoo or yahoo-plus, whatever nomenclature,\u201d the agency said.\n\n\u201cGive up, or give in. The Eagle will get you anytime, anywhere.\u201d\n\nOver time, the anti-graft body has made hunting down the cyber fraudsters a big chunk of its duty.\n\nIn Abeokuta for instance, EFCC arrested 60 suspected Internet fraudsters during an award ceremony at a hotel. Similar sting operations in Lekki-Ajah axis in Lagos said to be home of many Yahoo Yahoo boys had yielded unimaginable results. Major cities in the country like Benin City, Port Harcourt, Owerri, Ibadan, Osogbo, Ilorin, Abuja, among others, are home to many cyber fraudsters.\n\nNigerians react to menace\n\nThe traditional ruler of Umunkwo autonomous community in Imo State, Eze Declan Izim, a lecturer at Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, Owerri, condemned the Yahoo Yahoo menace on the rampage, declaring: \u201cI condemn it in its entirety.\u201d\n\nIn Benin City, Edo State, residents also flayed the spate of rising ritual killings, and traced the root of the menace to get-rich quick syndrome spirit now ruling the youths.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Vice President, South-South of National Youth Council of Nigeria, (NYCN), Comrade Innocent Ajayi\u200e, who is also the immediate past Edo State chapter chairman of NYCN, said it is painful that ritual killing is resonating among the teeming Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cTaking the life of an individual to acquire wealth is not the best way to go; but there is something that we must understand: these young people we are talking about are people who must have passed through the tutelage of our various leaders, either through parental upbringing, religious ways or through education.\u201d\n\nAn anonymous responder said that he was yet to get over his recent attack and the backlash he received from his colleagues and the Yahoo boys.\n\nHe told Sunday Sun that he publicly criticised them for what they stand for, forcing them to turn against him.\n\nHe disclosed that the so-called Yahoo boys are those who spray them good money while artists in the town perform on stage.\n\nHe said that some artistes were so bitter over his comments that they accused him of blocking their opportunity to make good money, stressing that the Yahoo boys are now the ones making their shows to blossom.\n\nHe flayed the lifestyle of some Nigerian celebrities, maintaining that they are influencing the younger ones in very many negative ways.\n\nIn a recent radio broadcast monitored in Lagos, a native doctor told him listeners that the Yahoo Yahoo challenge had become so terrible that even some parents now bring their children tasking him to prepare charms to enable them excel in the evil business.\n\nAlso in Lagos, a serving Nigerian army soldier last year was allegedly caught among the Yahoo Yahoo fraudsters while understudying the trade.\n\nCause of the problem\n\nLooking at how Nigeria is getting it all wrong, a Yoruba Ifa priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon said: \u201cWe can adduce this to the hardship in the country. People are going through very difficult and challenging times with many finding it hard to meet up with their daily financial obligations, including being able to feed themselves and their families because the government has failed in its responsibility of providing employment opportunities for the populace.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe youths on the other hand, do not deem it appropriate to get engaged in viable economic activities. Instead, majority of them have resorted to desperate means of making it in life, including the money-ritual option and engaging in cyber crimes.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected that these youths would consider taking up viable economic activities and earning decent living. It is unfortunate, however, that majority of them have taken to cutting corners and embracing the most reprehensible options.\u201d\n\nOn the likely consequences of the menace, he noted that any wealth acquired illegally is bound to be fleeting, and can only be enjoyed for a limited time.\n\n\u201cWhatever one does not labour for cannot be enjoyed as one would loved to. What we are witnessing now is very strange to Yoruba land. It is particularly disturbing that we don\u2019t know where these people get the information, how they go about it, and those who agree to do it for them. But, there is no doubt about the fact that those who engage in this practice will always live to regret their actions; they won\u2019t go scot-free.\n\nAppeal to political class\n\nSome people believe that politicians are escalating the problem with their big salaries and ostentatious living. One of such is Comrade Ajayi who said: \u201cLet me appeal to our political class that it is time for their members to stop using money flamboyantly, showing the world that they have arrived.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was growing up; I never had the opportunity of seeing people throw money as if they just went somewhere to pick it.\n\n\u201cAnd so, the Yahoo Yahoo we are seeing today is a product of what the young people are seeing; that is why they want to make wealth by all means.\u201d\n\nGet rich syndrome root of problem\n\nOn his part, Mr Tony Abolo, a veteran broadcaster and media consultant, blamed the quest to make quick money rather than hard work as being the root of the problem.\n\nHe said until the society starts asking questions about the source of people\u2019s wealth, and the political class stops displaying their wealth, the society is bound to face much ills.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with moral depravity of society. We are dealing with people who think money is everything. That is the life style of the political class. Everybody is running around chasing money; nobody is chasing hard work; that is the problem,\u201d Abolo said.\n\nSociety has failed\n\nAccording to Eze Izim, what is going on signifies \u201closs of societal values. I remember in those days, there were things people easily got scared of. That was blood; the other is the sacredness and sanctity of the human life.\n\n\u201cIn those days, there were some men of title who abhorred blood; they couldn\u2019t shield even a chicken\u2019s blood; they would faint at mere seeing blood.\n\n\u201cBut now, teenagers are even killing their own parents for money rituals \u2013 all because money has become everything.\n\n\u201cThen, kids learnt real values right from the home. They learnt that good name is better than riches. But now, money rules. That is why our teenagers are going haywire.\u201d\n\nHe decried what happened in Ogun State recently, describing it as \u201cblood-stirring.\u201d\n\nHe expressed sadness that \u201csimilar abominations are also happening elsewhere unreported.\u201d\n\nDr Grace Onyeabo, a parent and proprietress, God\u2019s Grace Academy, Lagos, is also unhappy, saying that \u201cwhat we are witnessing now is the outcome of the failure of the society to pay attention to the calls to address the need to re-orientate our children to embrace quality value system.\n\n\u201cAny culture that places too much emphasis on materialism is doomed to experience what we are witnessing now.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one country that celebrates wealth whose source people do not know.\n\n\u201cSomebody who could barely meet his basic needs some months ago suddenly becomes rich and nobody is questioning his source of wealth. Instead those who should lead the way in trying to determine how he came about his sudden wealth are the ones at the forefront of making the arrangements to confer chieftaincy title on the dubious character.\n\n\u201cThings can only get worse wherever people fail to do the right thing. The people should start to report anyone they suspect to have acquired wealth illegitimately to law enforcement agents for proper investigation into their source of wealth.\u201d\n\nGovernment failure also responsible\n\nChief Elebuibon blamed the government for failing in its responsibility of providing jobs for the youths, although he said that the government\u2019s failure should not be taken as an excuse to resort to illegality.\n\n\u201cOur youths should find ways of engaging themselves in something decent, meaningful and rewarding skills. They should stop looking for non-existent white-collar jobs. But above all, the government has a lot of roles to play in the lives of the youths.\u201d\n\nRole of parents also highlighted\n\nComrade Ajayi wants parents to begin to question their children.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhen a child who just graduated and has no job yet comes back home driving a car, and has no proof of what he did to buy such a car, I think the parents should ask questions before accepting him. Those who fail to do so are collaborating with evil.\u201d\n\nTowing similar line, Chief Elebuibon lamented that how some parents even encourage their children especially those who are into \u2018Yahoo yahoo.\u2019\n\n\u201cImagine a situation where parents do not see the need to question their children\u2019s source of wealth when they come home with things that ordinarily should be considered beyond their income. Your child comes home with an exotic car for instance, but rather than question how he got it, you join in celebrating him. So, most parents should be blamed for failing in their responsibility.\u201d\n\nSolution to current menace\n\nChief Elebuibon believes diligence and hard work are ways out of the problem.\n\nHe also believes \u201cthose who are desperate to be rich will definitely pay for their desperation some day.\n\n\u201cIn Yoruba land, it is believed that no deity will ever aid a lazy person. Diligence must always come first.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Eze Izim urged that while \u201cthe churches and mosques preach, and we the traditional rulers talk, the government should be committed to providing jobs.\n\n\u201cPeople in government need to help the youths learn new skills. They should embark on projects that directly impact the people, rather than embarking on political projects.\u201d\n\nReorientation also key\n\nEze Izim also called for reorientation on the part of all and sundry, declaring it \u201ca collective responsibility.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to the norms and values of our society which have long been eroded.\n\n\u201cThis is the job of the families, the villages, the schools, the churches and mosques, and even the government. The national and state orientation agencies should do something, the same for our role models, our celebrities.\n\n\u201cOur politicians should mind the way they spend money. They make the youths see money as everything.\u201d\n\nHe called on the youths to redirect their energies towards useful ventures, think outside the box and embrace skill learning.\n\nWhat NOA is doing\n\nNOA says it\u2019s doing something to change the narrative. According to Odenyi, \u201cour jingles and skits have been produced and will be out in the coming week.\n\n\u201cWhat we are campaigning is for parents to parent well, religious bodies and groups to teach the correct messages. We are asking community leaders to be watchful. It is the collective effort of the whole of society that we can overcome.\u201d",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nFast rising Nollywood actress, Chioma Richard would always attract attention whenever she steps out. If it\u2019s not for her charming beauty or classy style, it will definitely be for her frankness or acting talent.\n\nThe thespian got many eyes popping at her florescent skin at an event held recently, even as she shone like a million stars in the movie, Yahoo King.\n\nChioma, who dumped her business for the make-believe world, opens up in this no-holds-barred interview on her career, ideal man and turns off among others. Please enjoy it.\n\nWhat actually motivated you to be an actress?\n\nDuring my teenage years, I used to dream acting alongside my Nollywood idols like Patience Ozokwor and Mercy Johnson. As a result of this, I started developing strong passion for acting.\n\nAt what point did you discover you have acting talent?\n\nMy first audition was at Royal Palm Hotel, Aba. I was tensed because I was asked to mime a music video titled, Appreciation, and to my surprise I emerged the winner of the audition. Winning the audition boosted my confidence that in the near future, I could do well in the movie industry.\n\nNollywood is kind of saturated, what are your plans to overcome the ordeals and get accepted in the industry?\n\nMy plan to overcome the ordeals is to get the ability to read, understand and interpret my roles excellently, to the satisfaction of any director I work with. If I can do all these, the sky will be my limit. In the aspect of getting accepted within the industry, I am patient with everyone; most of the directors who have worked with me can testify to that. I don\u2019t put money first in anything I do; my focus is satisfying the directors, becoming producer\u2019s choice and being at peace with everybody I work with.\n\nWhat are those unique skills you are bringing to play that may stand you out or give you recognition among the big stars in Nollywood?\n\nPersonally, I am extremely bold. I am not intimidated by anybody on set. I have no stage fright, inferiority complex or timidity. Beside that, I am a fast learner. So, with all these features, I\u2019m hopeful of making headway in the industry by God\u2019s grace.\n\nIn the next five years, where do you see yourself in Nollywood?\n\nI see myself acting internationally and touching a lot of people\u2019s lives positively.\n\nWhich are the films you have acted in?\n\nI have starred in nothing less than 40 movies. I can mention a few like Yahoo King, Amaka\u2019s Fate, Canon Shot, Orphan Seven, Igbo King, The Blind And I, A Date With Fate, My Foolish Wife, Kill And Bury, Port Harcourt Husbands, and Dragon Warrior. Others are My Husband\u2019s Scandal, Oke Ochicho, Women in Power, Priceless Maiden, The Queen Decides, Message To Mary, The Priestess, Asaba, My Sugar Mummy and so many I cannot recall now.\n\nOf all the movies you have done, which ones are you most proud of?\n\nI am proud of all of them but I will give it to Yahoo King.\n\nWhat makes Yahoo King so special?\n\nYahoo King is special because it was my first mind-blowing movie. I featured with the like of Zubby Michael and Chinenye Ubah. It was directed by one of Nollywood\u2019s best, Ugezu J. Ugezu.\n\nCan you play sexy roles in movies?\n\nWhy not? But that should be to some extent. My dignity as a woman is at stake, so going nude should be ruled out of it, irrespective of the money involved.\n\nHow about kissing?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nI can kiss in a movie only on one condition. That is if the guy is extremely neat. I mean he must not have both mouth and body odour. It turns me off because I am allergic to bad smells. Any kind of foul smell could hinder me from interpreting my role perfectly.\n\nHave you been in romantic position with a man with mouth odour before?\n\nYes, I have had an experience like that in the past but that was in a movie. As a new actress in Port Harcourt, I vividly remember acting with a guy who had mouth and body odour. As a result of this, it affected my performance to the extent that I had to tell the director that I couldn\u2019t cope anymore, as it was a romantic role.\n\nWere your parents on board with your career choice?\n\nI doubt if my dad of blessed memory would have supported me if he were alive when I started acting. But my mum also of blessed memory gave me her backing before her demise. I remember there was a time she gave me money to visit my uncle in Enugu, to go and tell him my intention of becoming an actress.\n\nHave you ever been asked for sex in exchange for movie role?\n\nNo one has boldly asked me for sex in exchange for role. I have never had an experience like that since I started my career as an actress.\n\nHave you at any point in your acting career thought of quitting?\n\nSometimes insults from production managers, colleagues and financial issues make you think twice.\n\nLike I said earlier, with patience you will go far in the industry. It\u2019s the key to success.\n\nNollywood looks glamorous on the outside. As an insider, would you say acting is profitable?\n\nActing is like farming; you sow before reaping. It\u2019s not always bed of roses in the beginning, but if you can be patient and stay focus, you will definitely reap the fruits of your labour.\n\nWhat changes do you hope to see in the Nigerian film industry?\n\nI look forward to the day when sentiments, negligence, discrimination and other ills will become a thing of the past.\n\nWhat motivates you when you are on set?\n\nFirst and foremost, God is my inspiration. The next person is my elder brother, Chika Onuzuruike for believing and standing by me. Other members of my family, friends and fans have all been motivating me as well.\n\nWhat is your selling point or most attractive asset as an actress?\n\nMy greatest assets are my complexion, beautiful face and constant smiles as well as my big, natural and irresistible butt. Don\u2019t also forget my big boobs. They are big and natural with no breast enhancement. Sometimes, my friends tell me that I am so blessed. And this has been of tremendous advantage to me as I often get sub-lead roles because of my physique.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing you have done as an actress?\n\nThat should be smoking on set.\n\nWhat has been the most challenging role you have had to play and what made it memorable?\n\nMy most challenging role was playing a doctor. It was memorable for me because I was able to use all the medical terminologies. At the end of the day, the director heaped praises on me.\n\nWhat should your fans expect from you this year?\n\nMy social media channels will be extremely busy this year. My fans should expect new, funny and educative comedy skits and movies.",

          "text": "*President expresses shock, millions mourn\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nThe Head of Sokoto kingmakers, the Magajin Garin Sokoto, Alhaji Hassan Danbaba, who died yesterday, has been laid to rest in a glorious ceremony.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has expressed deep shock over the death of the kingmaker, who was until his death, the board chairman of the Sokoto Rima River Basin Development Authority (SRRBDA).\n\nHe was a non-exectuive director of Thisday Newspapers Limited and owned several businesses including hotels.\n\nThe influential kingmaker, who was the grandson of the late Premier of Northern Region and Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello, reportedly slumped in his hotel in Kaduna yesterday, and died on his way to the hospital.\n\nDanbaba died at the age of 51, barely 22 months after he lost his mother, A\u2019ishatu, the eldest daughter of the late Premier of Northern Region.\n\nHis mother died in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) in April 2020.\n\nA source close to the deceased said the late Magajin Garin Sokoto, was in Kaduna to condole with a former National Security Adviser (NSA), General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau (rtd), on the death of his brother.\n\nThe source said: \u201cMagajin came to Kaduna on Thursday to condole with General Gusau, on the death of his brother.\n\n\u201cAs usual of him, he lodged in his hotel, Stonehedge in Kaduna metropolis.\n\n\u201cBoth Gusau and Magajin had prepared to make a joint return trip from Kaduna to Abuja on Saturday. After having his bath at 11 a.m., he dressed up to go and join General Gusau in his house.\n\n\u201cWhen he was about to leave, he slumped. His aides rallied around him and rushed him to a hospital. But on the way, he gave up the ghost.\u201d\n\nThe source added that the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, had ordered the evacuation of Danbaba\u2019s remains to the Government House in Kaduna before he was airlifted to Sokoto, where he was buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of his position as the head of the kingmakers of Sokoto Caliphate, there is a reserved cemetery, Hubbaren Shehu, where royal leaders are usually buried in Sokoto,\u201d the source added.\n\nUntil his death, he was one of those behind the Rice Revolution of President Muhammadu Buhari being championed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nHe played a key role in the last Rice Pyramid fair in Abuja by the RIFAN.\n\nMagajin Garin Sokoto was part of the eminent Nigerians who converged on Lagos last weekend to find solutions to the challenges confronting the country ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nIn a condolence message issued by his media aide, Garba Shehu, in Abuja, President Buhari said: \u201cI am shocked beyond words. The Magajin Gari leaves a void that will be difficult to fill in the Sultanate and our nation.\n\n\u201dHe was always full of happiness and warmth. He will be remembered as an envoy of the culture and traditions of the Sultanate.\n\n\u201cMy prayers and thoughts are with the family he left behind, the government and people of Sokoto State. May his soul rest in peace.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Senator representing Sokoto North Senatorial district, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, has also expressed grief over the demise of Magajin Garin Sokoto.\n\nIn a condolence message issued yesterday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Hassan Sahabi, the senator described the late Magajin Gari as a distinguished gentleman and respected traditional ruler, who contributed immensely to the development of the Sokoto Caliphate, and the nation.\n\nAccording to Wamakko, the Sokoto Caliphate has indeed lost a father and a respected leader who lived a life of service to the Caliphate, Nigeria and humanity.\n\nWamakko, prayed to Almighty Allah to forgive his shortcomings and reward his good deeds with Aljannat Firdaus.\n\nHe left behind three wives and six children.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Former VP being driven by money, not ability, says Middle Belt Forum\n\n*PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo: Atiku\u2019s position a mockery of Nigeria\u2019s constitution\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar yesterday came under fire for faulting the call on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone its presidential ticket to a particular region of the country, and insisting that the Nigerian constitution does not recognise zoning.\n\nThe 17 southern governors; the Southern and Middle-Belt Forum, comprising the Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, the pan-Igbo socio-political group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and the Middle-Belt Forum, had called on all political parties to zone their presidential tickets to the South.\n\nBut Atiku, who is one of the prominent northern politicians interested in contesting the 2023 presidential election, has faulted the agitation.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with members of a group, \u2018Let\u2019s Fix Nigeria\u2019 who were on a solidarity visit at his residence in Abuja on Friday, Atiku said zoning was unconstitutional.\n\nThe former vice president argued: \u201cThere is no zoning in the constitution; there is none. I was a member of the constituent assembly that drafted the current constitution and there was nothing like that.\u201d\n\nHe also reportedly stated that any Nigerian endowed with the right attributes could lead the country, as against the call for a younger president.\n\nReacting to the rejection of zoning by Atiku, the National President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, told THISDAY yesterday that the former vice president was being driven by money and not ability.\n\nHe advised Atiku to be patriotic in his quest for power, adding that \u201che\u2019s not more intelligent than everybody in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Atiku were not a rich man, would he have been clamouring for president? He\u2019s just a Nigerian; he\u2019s not more intelligent than everybody in this country. It\u2019s his money that is driving him, rather than ability. Is he saying he\u2019s the only one that has the intellect and capacity to rule this country? Does he have to be a president to be able to add value to governance in this country? There some individuals who think if they are not the one, nothing can happen in this country. But that is a lie; there are so many people out there.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to save this country; the presidency is not about an individual, but about saving Nigeria,\u201d Pogu said.\n\nReacting to Atiku\u2019s claim that zoning is not in the Nigeria\u2019s constitution, Pogu said: \u201cThere are so many things that are not in the constitution that we practice for political stability in the country.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Peoples Democratic Party; a party Atiku joined in founding; a party that I can say that he\u2019s one of the greatest beneficiaries, has zoning in its constitution,\u201d he added.\n\nPogu recalled that in 2019, \u201cwe all felt that this government was not doing well for Nigeria, and we said Atiku should then come in and take over. We did what we should do. But there were a lot of rigging and inflation of votes; like in Borno State that her people have been dislodged from their places producing unbelievably higher votes than states that are stable; and Yobe State producing votes higher than accredited voters.\n\n\u201cWhen the party went to court, Atiku abandoned everybody and disappeared to Dubai. People didn\u2019t even ask him the reason he disappeared. It was as if he was not interested in taking back his mandate. Today, he is the one saying this, because he thinks it is birthright. I don\u2019t want to talk too much. Nigerians will give him the deserving response.\u201d\n\nPogu urged the former vice president to be a patriot and an elder statesman, and support any Southerner he believes would not be a tribalist and would not be nepotic to address Nigeria\u2019s problems.\n\nPANDEF: Atiku\u2019s Position on Zoning Unfortunate, Disappointing\n\nOn its part, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described the position of Atiku that zoning is not provided for in the 1999 Constitution as unfortunate and disappointing.\n\nThe group also described Atiku\u2019s position as a mockery of the nation\u2019s constitution, which preaches equity, fairness and inclusiveness.\n\nIt reiterated the call on all registered political parties to field southern candidates for the 2023 general election so as to have the support of the group.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Hon. Ken Robinson, told THISDAY yesterday that his group was disappointed at the statement credited to Atiku on the zoning of the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is rather unfortunate that the former vice president drew such a conclusion. He knows his statement is inconsistent with established and justifiable protocols and conventions, which have helped to sustain considerable understanding, peace and stability in the polity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the narrative that there is no zoning in the nation\u2019s constitution is a conscienceless mockery of Nigeria\u2019s democratic evolution, and indeed, the country\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cIt bears underscoring that Nigeria\u2019s Constitution, though flawed, has ample provisions that emphasise inclusiveness, fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cSection 14(3) of the Constitution (as amended) provides that \u2018the composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or any of its agencies.\u201d The intent and purpose of this section are precise and explicit.\u201d\n\nRobinson further stated that zoning and rotation of key political positions in the polity cannot be discarded in a diverse and complex society like Nigeria, particularly, under the prevailing circumstances.\n\nHe advised Atiku and other northerners interested in succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 to forget such idea, adding that it cannot stand the test of time.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo Expresses Disappointment\n\nAlso reacting, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday expressed disappointment at Atiku\u2019s comments on zoning, describing them as unfortunate and sad.\n\nThe organisation said it was unthinkable that the former vice president who had benefited from zoning in his political contests over the years would suddenly kick against same.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia, who spoke to THISDAY, noted that having enjoyed tremendous support of Ndigbo over the years, Atiku should use the 2023 presidency to reciprocate the gesture.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, Atiku has been involved in the politics of this country for about 30 years, from SDP, and several other parties.\n\n\u201cHe understands the politics of Nigeria. We are surprised at this his position. PDP has been using zoning as strategy for winning elections in the past. He should realise that Igbos have always supported him even four years ago. If there are any people he should show support, it should be Igbos,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further noted that Atiku should not to allow his presidential ambition to becloud his sense of reasoning.\n\n\u201cWe are completely disappointed that he is making this kind of comment. Atiku knows the truth and should not allow his ambitions to lead him to abandoning all he once stood for.\n\n\u201cWe used to know him as a man that supports justice, fairness and equity; let him not deviate from this because it will be so unfortunate and sad,\u201d Ogbonnia added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*STI SYMPHONY makes U-turn off coast of Guinea\n\n*OPEC\u2019s production drops by 700,000bpd\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFollowing the circulation of adulterated petrol in Nigeria, which damaged vehicle engines last week, the federal government has turned back two tankers carrying petrol loaded in Antwerp, Belgium, and destined for Lagos, THISDAY learnt.\n\nThis is coming as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nThe off-specification fuel, it was learnt, was rejected amid the raging controversy over the bad fuel in circulation in the country, which led to the disruption of the country\u2019s supply chain, resulting in long queues in filling stations across the country.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol, which grounded movements in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, was made worse by the shortage of inventory, according to the figures released by the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC).\n\nAs at yesterday, majority of filling stations in Abuja were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open.\n\nThe imported cargoes were said to have high methanol content, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, after over 100 million litres were said to have been in circulation.\n\nBut quoting Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking and other sources, Reuters reported that the two tankers, STI SYMPHONY and VELOS DIAMANTIS, were turned back by the federal government against the backdrop of other petrol cargoes loaded in Antwerp for containing too much methanol.\n\nAccording to a fixture list from a ship broker and Refinitiv Eikon data, Litasco chartered the STI SYMPHONY for January 15 to take 90,000 tonnes of petrol to West Africa.\n\nThe STI SYMPHONY loaded petrol in Antwerp around January 22 before sailing to Lagos, but has now been turned back, according to the Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking.\n\nHowever, the tanker did a U-turn off the coast of Guinea on February and is now heading back to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub, Reuters reported.\n\nAccording to the report, NNPC did not respond to a request for comment. Litasco had previously said it does not comment on trading activities and did not immediately respond to a query on the STI Symphony.\n\nThe VELOS DIAMANTIS, carrying 60,000 tonnes, and allegedly chartered by Mercuria, did a U-turn on February 4, after showing Lagos as its destination, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed. A Mercuria source, however, said the company no longer owns the tanker\u2019s cargo.\n\nThe NNPC had while labouring to absolve itself of complicity in the importation and distribution of millions of litres of the bad product into the country, named Belgium as the country of origin of the adulterated fuel.\n\nAmid the damage done to vehicles in some states in the country, the federal government had vowed to investigate the matter with a view to bringing the culprits to book.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, however, stated that from his investigation, the four petrol cargoes were imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.\n\nAll the companies mentioned, aside Duke Oil, the NNPC\u2019s trading arm, have since denied complicity.\n\nIronically, Kyari had maintained that the cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with the Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\nHe stated that all defaulting suppliers had been put on notice for remedial actions, stressing that the NNPC would work with other stakeholders to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\nHe did not explain what \u201cfurther necessary action\u201d would be taken even after saying that there was no national standard for methanol in the fuel imported into Nigeria.\n\nThe decision to reject the cargoes also came days after President Muhammadu Buhari expressed anger over the importation and circulation of the contaminated petrol in the country.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the President had therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, be queried immediately.\n\nNNPC had also in January announced that it received four tankers carrying unusable petrol that was loaded in Belgium by Litasco, the trading arm of Russia\u2019s Lukoil, and sold to local traders.\n\nThe fuel was found to contain too much methanol and was removed from circulation, causing shortages nationwide.\n\nFollowing the incident, the NNPC banned methanol content in future petrol deliveries. Previously, traders said Nigeria did not specify methanol content. Methanol is sometimes added to petrol in small amounts because it is a cheaper, and cleaner burning fuel that also optimises engine functioning.\n\nAlthough methanol, in small amounts, is a regular petrol additive, the industry\u2019s regulator said the supplier of the off-specification petrol was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortia THISDAY learnt, receives some quantities of crude oil in exchange for petrol.\n\nEmbattled Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, during the week, stated that the NNPC had received a delivery of 300 million litres to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nThe NMDPRA boss had further stated that the country currently has petrol that can last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve\n\nOPEC\u2019s Production Drops by 700,000bpd\n\nMeanwhile, OPEC and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their oil production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nAn S&P Global Platts survey indicated that OPEC\u2019s 13 countries raised output by 150,000 bpd from December, pumping 28.19 million bpd of crude, while the nine non-OPEC partners, led by Russia, only managed to add a meagre 10,000 bpd, producing 13.99 million bpd.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s underperformance continued even as there appears to be no end in sight to the rising prices of oil occasioned by tightening supply and growing demand for the commodity, mainly on the back of growing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nOil traders have continued to be rattled by reports that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could take place within days and bid up oil prices to over $95 in large trading volumes.\n\nTraders fear disruptions of oil and natural gas flows from Russia to Europe in case a war begins, either directly from blown-up pipelines or halted flows, or indirectly when energy trade gets caught up in sanctions.\n\nRussia delivers Europe with one-third of its natural gas needs and exports around 2 million bpd of both crude oil and refined products to European nations.\n\nAccording to the OPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for January, released this week, Nigeria struggled to pump 1.399 million bpd out of the total allocation, quoting primary (direct) sources.\n\nThis was in contrast to December 2021, when it pumped 1.197 million barrels per day and November when it was only able to produce 1.275 million bpd.\n\nThe biggest increases in crude oil production came from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, while output declined in OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer Iraq, as well as in Venezuela and Libya.\n\nBut in all, S&P stated that 14 out of the 18 members with quotas underproduced their targets, pushing OPEC+ compliance to 120.8 per cent, the highest since the group instituted record output cuts in April 2020 to pull the oil market out of its pandemic crash.\n\nDespite strong gains from the group\u2019s core Gulf members and Russia, disruptions in several OPEC+ countries, including Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Libya and Iraq, limited the bloc\u2019s growth in January, it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He has a cult-like followership of nearly 15 million people. But that never took him to the presidency until we had a handshake across the Niger with the west,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWrongly, he was assumed to be a northern\u2019 hegemonist\u2019, a provincial politician, even a religious bigot by some of our compatriots in the southern part of the country.

          "title": "11 African startups to watch out for in 2022",
          "text": "It\u2019s safe to say the Africa startup ecosystem came full circle last year with a record-breaking number of new innovative startups and huge investment to match it. If innovation is a reflection of economic, social, and technological advancement, then we can say the ecosystem has advanced.\n\nSo, out of hundreds of excellent startups in Africa, we have curated 10 that we think you, our readers, should watch closely as we expect them to do some incredible stuff this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFintech/cryptocurrency\n\nFounded in February 2020 by Stephen Young, NFTfi is a decentralised and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan platform where users can list their NFT collateral to get loan offers from other users.\n\nOn the platform, you can request for a loan using your NFT and other users start bidding to lend you money in cryptocurrency with varying interest rates and repayment terms. Once you accept an offer, you\u2019ll receive wETH or DAI liquidity in your wallet and your NFT is transferred into a double-audited escrow smart contract for the loan duration. If you repay the loan before it expires, you\u2019ll get your NFT back. If you default, the lender can foreclose and receive your NFT.\n\nThis is a good innovation considering the amount of money locked in NFTs. Imagine being able to access liquidity without selling off your NFT.\n\nAs crypto continues to gain mass acceptance and adoption, so does the need to make it easy for holders to transact with it. Lazerpay, founded and launched into beta in November last year by Njoku Emmanuel, is a payment gateway for crypto. Think of Paystack, but for crypto.\n\nLast year, Lazerpay secured an undisclosed amount of investment from Nestcoin, an innovative venture that builds, operates, and invests in crypto and Web3 products. As it\u2019s set to launch to the public, the startup is expected to do to cryptocurrency what Paystack and Flutterwave are doing to fiat in Africa.\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July 2021, GetEquity says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nOn GetEquity, users get to invest as little as $10 in startups. Startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nAs at December last year, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nFounded by Jesse Ghansah and Barima Effah, Float, formerly known as Swipe, was launched in June 2021 as a cash management and credit provider fintech company for Africa\u2019s fast-growth companies.\n\nThe startup recently picked up $17 million in equity and debt funding from notable investors across the world including Cauris, Tiger Global, and Justin Mateen\u2019s JAM Fund, Ingressive Capital, Magic Fund, and many angel investors.\n\nThe company is already operational in Nigeria and Kenya and the seed round is expected to expedite its growth this year.\n\nLaunched in April last year by Ahmed Sabbah, a co-founder at Swvl and Youssef Sholqamy, a former engineer at Uber, Telda is a digital bank that provides free accounts for its users and enables them to send and receive money. It also provides them with a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills.\n\nIn May, just a month after it launched, the company announced that it has raised $5 million pre-seed funding led by Sequoia. It also affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers digitally.\n\nOwing to its achievement in a short period of time, we expect the startup to even achieve more in 2022, so get your eyes peeled on this one.\n\nEdtech\n\nCraydel is an edtech startup that was launched in March 2021 by Manish Sardana, John Nguru, and Shayne Aman Premji. The startup creates a reliable portal to guide African students in their tertiary education, course selection, and career decisions.\n\nCraydel provides a digital end-to-end higher education service. Its service spans from the point of students choosing schools, programmes, and courses to the application and admission stages. The company also provides visa support for those who choose to study abroad, all for free.\n\nCraydel is already in partnership with 90 institutions across Canada, the UK and US, Ireland, and African countries like Malawi and Kenya. There are over 3,000 courses\u2014spread across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes\u2014available to choose from.\n\nFounded in May 2021 but launched into beta in December by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nThe platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. It has raised a $3.5 million pre-seed capital war chest from Target Global and top African founders like Shola Akindolu and Babs Ogundeyin, among others, to bring effective education to its target audience.\n\nWith the founder\u2019s experience, quality of the team, and the early investment secured, we expect this startup to do great things in the edtech sector this year.\n\nHealthtech\n\nBypa-ss was founded by Dr Andrew Saad in 2019 and entered the market with its proprietary product, HealthTag, a platform for Health Information Exchange (HIE), offering physicians a free cloud-based clinic management solution.\n\nThrough linking with a cloud database, HealthTag securely stores medical records collected from different healthcare providers and gives them to their rightful owner, the user.\n\nAs of November last year, Saad said the company currently has over 17,000 HealthTag cardholders and over 3,500 healthcare providers\u2014mainly in clinics, pharmacies, labs, and radiology centers using their product.\n\nBuilt on the blockchain technology, Afya Rekod wants to create a seamless mobilised healthcare in Africa, where the patients\u2014who are the only moving parts in healthcare\u2014own all the rights to their data.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the co-founder and CEO of Adanian Labs John Kamara, Afya Rekod provides 4 unique offerings to its customers: its core patient\u2019s portal; electronic health record systems (EHRs) for hospitals; diagnostic centres for medical labs; and disease management for control and management of chronic diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\n\nEcommerce and logistics\n\nTendo is a social ecommerce platform that eases setup and operating costs for social commerce entrepreneurs by providing them with logistics, financing, and marketing.\n\nFounded by Derrick Mungai, Evans Darbo Boateng, Felix Manford, and Primerose Katena, Tendo provides a curated catalogue of products, marketing tools, and other tools that facilitate trading for its users\u2014resellers\u2014to choose from. Once they sell the product at their own chosen price, Tendo handles the rest\u2014ships the product, subtracts the cost and remits the profit in the account of the seller.\n\nTendo simply enables anyone to start an online shop with zero capital. The company has a unique solution to social commerce. It also made it into Y Combinator 2022 Winter Batch, and this is an indicator of its potential to be watched closely.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by Tola Onayemi and Tope Obanla, Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks, and patent intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360-degree business launchpad: business registration, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nWe think this startup is building a game-changing product; something that will have a significant impact on the growth of African startups.\n\nWe know you have some startups you are rooting for this year that we might have missed.

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5. Home services\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Yung Nollywood\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one-time food platters? Daily food packages that trump the time-consuming activity of cooking.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, and that includes automating home services like laundry and cooking.\n\nStartups like Eden Life have created platforms where you can subscribe to monthly packages for laundry, cooking and cleaning services. If you\u2019re going to go with the food option for Valentine\u2019s, then go all the way.\n\nPrice range: From $50\n\nThis is labelled Series C because it\u2019s also a long-term gift. Every time your loved one eats or steps into clean rooms and clothes, they\u2019ll think of you and how much you\u2019ve made their lives easier.\n\n6. Crypto\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Corporate Compliance Insights\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue. Crypto is here, and its promise is true.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk much about crypto. Like your relationships, it has its ups and downs, \ud83d\udc80 but that\u2019s what makes us love it.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, add to your loved one\u2019s crypto stash and help them build their way into digital wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, like bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. And if you\u2019re worried about the chances of the coins depreciating, remember that even your relationship is a gamble.\n\nGet on BuyCoins, Yellow Card, Quidax, Nestcoin, or Bitsika to mine your way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nPrice range: From $1 (invest as required).\n\nThis is a Series C gift because it\u2019s long-term for both of you. If the relationship dips, you can take comfort in knowing that whenever crypto dips, so will your ex\u2019s happiness.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please give TechCabal a gift by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp or Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make. He also advised them to contribute to open source blockchain projects and look for ways to solve the problems that exist today in Web2 with Web3.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Demand for office space falls to 5yr low",
          "text": "The prime office segment of the Nigerian real estate market recorded its worst performance in five years with the vacancy rate remaining unchanged as of the second half of 2021, a new market report has shown.\n\nThe report describes 2021 generally as the office market\u2019s less than a desirable period when the performance of key metrics such as take-up was at its lowest.\n\nActivity, within the period, remained significantly subdued and, though there was a strong recovery in inquiries in the second half of the year, these did not translate to actual deals concluded.\n\nIn Ikoyi and Victoria Island, Lagos, for instance, asking rents for grade A office space were $700 and $630, respectively, down from $1,000 and $850, respectively, about three years ago.\n\nAll these are, however, understandable or expected in the sector still smarting from the crippling impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with its frequent lockdowns, physical and social distancing rules that compelled many organisations to adopt remote working, leaving behind large office spaces.\n\nThe situation in office space sharply contrasts that of the residential segment of the market where Bismarck Rewane says prices and sales value in leading cities for land and residential apartments have risen, noting that the retail market is experiencing market corrections due to climbing demand from local investors.\n\nRewane in his February breakfast meeting at the Lagos Business School projects the global value of the real estate sector to grow to $85.1 trillion in 2025 from $34 trillion in 2021, pointing out that core cities such as Lagos will drive the Nigerian investment landscape.\n\nThough retail and hospitality sub-sectors were equally hard-hit along with office space by the pandemic, in terms of recovery, office is lagging. Retail particularly has recovered significantly, riding on a food investment.\n\nBroll Property Services, which compiled the new report, looking at the second half of 2021, notes that not only did the traditional drivers of demand in the office market shift, transaction volumes and sizes continue to decline.\n\nHowever, Amaka Ajaegbu, Broll\u2019s research manager, Nigeria says, \u201cThe high specification buildings in the market are doing relatively well, given the existing realities, with a number of landlords securing near 100 percent renewals of existing leases, albeit at more competitive terms in some cases.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ajaegbu, the additional leases totalling 1000 square meters that were recorded during the period under review were driven by co-working, fintech, and financial services companies. \u201cThere was a slight recovery in occupancy levels, however, many corporates continued to adhere to COVID-19 work policies,\u201d she notes.\n\nShe states further that, though take-up enquiries improved notably in the period under review, these enquiries failed to move take-up rates, adding that new leases signed within the period H2:2021 was recorded at an estimated 1,079m\u00b2, bringing total take-up in 2021 to 1,790 square meters.\n\nThis shows a decline of about 78 percent relative to take-up recorded in 2020. Lease renewals in the period were generally successful, with a majority of leases renewed upon expiry in the period.\n\nRead also: Real estate trends to watch as sector recovers\n\nDolapo Omidire, CEO, Estate Intel, had in an earlier report, said that while absorption levels remained low for prime offices which recorded vacancy levels ranging between 12 percent and 36 percent for Grade A and B offices, developers remained bullish on the market with over 600,000 square meters of space under development.\n\nThe Broll report corroborates this view but with a much lower number of pipeline projects. \u201cAbout 156,000 square meters of space is expected for delivery in the next two years, with 70 percent of that pipeline anticipated for delivery in 2022. Assessing the investment nature of expected stock, about 64 percent of the pipeline is speculative,\u201d Ajaegbu states.\n\nShe notes that the current pipeline of buildings has put many landlords on edge. There is a significant concentration of pipeline projects on the Alfred Rewane strip in Ikoyi, home to developments such as Heritage Place, Kings Tower and Alliance Place, Kingsway Tower, Famfa Oil Tower, etc.\n\nThe likes of Dangote and BUA are building their head/regional offices on that strip with Famfa Tower also nearing completion in the location. In Victoria Island, developments such as the TGLS HQ Crystal Tower, Trinity Tower, and the Azuri constitute some of the pipeline in the location.\n\nAn assessment of tenant preferences relative to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that, on average, security, building amenities, and location are the top three influences that drive demand in the market.\n\n\u201cAbout 25 percent of occupiers are looking to cut down space in the future while over 30 percent will leave their requirements unchanged in the foreseeable future. When assessing the future of work, about 43 percent of occupiers are uncertain about the future of work,\u201d Ajaegbu reveals.",

          "title": "IMF says Nigeria risking financial squeeze as debt piles",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nigeria\u2019s decade-long rise in public debt could create both financial as well as revenue squeeze for the economy in the medium term.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s mission chief for Nigeria, Jesmin Rahman in the IMF/Nigeria 2021 article IV consultation staff press conference stated that though the country\u2019s current debt dynamics at the moment seem favourable as it still resides within the 30 percent threshold, its trajectory, however, would become a major economic concern in the medium term.\n\n\u201cPublic debt threshold for emerging markets stand at 10 percent; however, Nigeria currently spends above 80 percent to service its debt.\n\n\u201cRecent estimates indicate that public debt is to increase from 36 percent to 40 percent in the medium term. Should this happen, it is going to become a major cause for concern for the Nigerian government,\u201d she said.\n\nDebt servicing for Nigeria since the oil decline in 2020 has been dependent on CBN overdraft and Eurobond subscriptions.\n\nThomas Alun, a senior economist at the IMF stated that while Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds are oversubscribed, dependence on Eurobonds however, is quite risky as economic volatility could translate to both financial as well as revenue squeeze for the Nigerian economy which in turn further escalates the country\u2019s rising debt.\n\nHe further stated that Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability or further crisis is dependent on a number of economic factors.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt trend is not looking favorable on the debt portfolio end but the estimates are dependent on various economic factors.\n\n\u201cWhether debt becomes stressful or not is dependent on a number of factors like growth, interest rate, oil prices, financing situation in the country amongst others,\u201d Alun said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s debt service is currently suffocating federal spending and by extension is suffocating the general economy and the living conditions of Nigerian households. Accompanying this grim reality is the government\u2019s heavy reliance on oil revenues which has been extremely anemic in the last couple of years.\n\nDwindling oil revenues which emanated in 2020 as a result of the slump in oil prices in the international market due to the covid-19 pandemic, necessitated the Nigerian government to rely heavily on borrowing (both external and domestic), to finance its projects and try to close up budget deficits.\n\nThis notwithstanding has not convinced the Nigerian populace as well as foreign investors\u2019 as to why the country\u2019s borrowing has been significantly rising since 2016 with no evidence (infrastructure or otherwise) to justify it.\n\nDating back to 2015, data culled from the Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that the nation\u2019s external debt stood at $10.31bn and total public debt stood at $63.806bn or N12.1trn within the review period.\n\nSix years down the line (2021), the figure had almost tripled to $37.95bn for foreign debt and $92.626bn or N38.0trn for total public debt as of September 2021, representing a 268 percent increase in external debts and a 214.0 per cent increase in total debts.\n\nIn a failed attempt to sustain these debts, the Federal Government spends trillions of naira yearly servicing more debts.\n\nSince 2017, this administration has spent a total of N15.375trn on debt servicing, excluding N296bn and N110bn allocated for sinking funds in 2019 and 2020.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head of Retail Investment at Chapel Hill Denham told Business Day that when a budget crisis emanates, the capital expenditure which directly impacts the general economy is always at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be talking about having any meaningful growth in the economy if we don\u2019t spend more on capital expenditures, which happens to be the productive sector.\n\n\u201cFrom potholed and often barely paved streets of Lagos to moribund refineries around the country to accident-prone highways on Federal roads to inadequate health and education infrastructure, both Nigerians and foreign investors visiting Nigeria are reminded repeatedly of the country\u2019s urgent need for capital. Many investors, however, continue to be willing lenders, despite obvious signs that their money may not always have been put into the most productive use.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the major reasons why when the base effect is taken out of the equation, we still see that the country\u2019s growth rate is still lagging behind the population growth rate.\n\n\u201cAnother major concerning factor is that recurrent expenditure continues to increase which means that the government would subsequently increase borrowing and as a result, servicing cost would continue to increase which would, in turn, translate to an inefficient budget,\u201d Ebo said.\n\nThis has, as a result, erupted questions by analysts as to whether the public finances of the biggest economy in Africa (Nigeria) are as sustainable as they appear and why the country\u2019s debt has lingered this long and continues to significantly increase.\n\nBetween 2017 till date, the Federal Government has budgeted a total of N19.16trn for capital expenditure (money spent to buy, maintain or improve fixed assets).\n\nData from the Budget Office revealed that in the 2017 fiscal year, the Federal Government spent N2.177trn out of N7.441trn aggregate revenue as capital expenditure. The amount represented 29.25 percent of the total revenue in that year.\n\nFor 2018, N2.873trn was expended on capital projects, which was 31.50 percent of N9.120trn total expenditure.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, N2.090trn and N2.140trn, respectively, were spent as capital expenditure. The figures represented 23.43 percent and 20.71 percent of aggregate expenditure for the years which was N8.920trn and N10.330trn, respectively.\n\nThe amount budgeted for capital expenditure saw an increase in 2021 and 2022 as N4.989trn and N4.891trn were budgeted for capital projects. This shows 34.24 percent and 29.83 percent of aggregate expenditure for the years at N14.570trn and N16.391trn, respectively.\n\nHowever, while presenting the 2021 budget performance, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed had said that N1.79trn had been spent on capital projects between January and August 2021.\n\nEmeka Ucheaga, the CEO of EUA Intelligence and a financial analyst at Credit Direct limited stated that sub-national debt was also another factor that has played a significant role in elongating the country\u2019s current rising debt debacle.\n\n\u201cMost states generate minimal revenue outside their monthly allocation of Nigeria\u2019s anemic oil income. They depend almost exclusively on monthly allocations of federal revenues, which have been drastically declining in recent times,\u201d he said.\n\nMany states have been borrowing to meet their salary obligations, often at exorbitant interest rates (as high as 25-28 percent). States\u2019 borrowing trends are risky and need to be addressed.\n\nIn 2015, Global Credit Ratings, the African equivalent of Moody\u2019s or Fitch announced that it was going to place the sub-national debt sector on a negative outlook and downgrade five state government credit ratings. Of the eight states it rated, six were below the threshold for issuing investment-grade bonds.\n\nSome of Nigeria\u2019s richest states are actually its most indebted. They owe the most both in terms of overall dollar amounts and as a percentage of internally generated, non-federally derived revenues, or IGR.\n\nFor example, Data from Debt Management Office (DMO) revealed that Delta State which is popularly known for its oil-rich heritage was Nigeria\u2019s third most indebted state as at the end of 2014.\n\nIt owed $233 million to its creditors, roughly five times its annual IGR then. This amount was well beyond the World Bank\u2019s debt burden threshold that stipulated that debt should not exceed 200 percent of IGR.\n\nRead also: Nigeria remains open to investors \u2013 DMO\n\nThat being said, half of all the states in Nigeria have debt-to-revenue ratios that are twice as high as the World Bank sustainability ratio or higher.\n\nJust as there is no easy hack to paying back debts, there are no nice ways to say that the continuously increasing amount spent on debt servicing has debilitating impacts on the economy.\n\nWith 40 percent of Nigerians still living below the poverty line, Nigeria\u2019s revenue projection is beginning to look unattainable and unable to meet the deteriorating situation in the country.\n\nEsther Oye, an economic analyst and a lecturer at Covenant University stated that recent trends indicate that Nigeria is going to be borrowing to the quantum of our budget projections.\n\n\u201cThe direct implication is that any additional money that the government spends would be from additional borrowing; so what it means is that the borrowing will continue to increase.\n\n\u201cIf all our revenue is going to the servicing of debt, it means we have major fiscal problems which could have dire consequences in the near future,\u201d Oye said.\n\nThe Nigerian economy has been and is still operating in \u2018reverse\u2019, Productivity rates are low while debt servicing is increasing (ridiculous). In order to restore balance, two critical realities are non-negotiable; productivity has to increase which in turn would translate to increased revenue. The government needs to begin to invest heavily in production else this ever inflating debt crisis would swallow the economy sooner than later.",

          "title": "Apathy, dysfunctional BVAS, late arrival of officials mark FCT Area Council poll",
          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council election which held Saturday was characterised by low voter turnout, dysfunctional and failed Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) devices as well as late arrival of officials for the commencement of the exercise, despite assurances by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) that the polls would be better than past ones.\n\nThere are a total of 1.373 million registered voters in the FCT spread across the six Area Councils, 62 Wards, and 2,822 Polling Units in the Territory.\n\nBut BusinessDay observed that less than 50percent of the voters especially in the city center, comprising, Asokoro, Garki, Wuse, Maitama, Wuse 2, Jabi, Gwarinpa turned out to exercise their franchise.\n\nHours after the election finally commenced behind schedule \u2013 due to the late arrival of voting materials and INEC officials- very few or virtually no voters were seen at most of the Polling Units (PUs) especially the newly created ones.\n\nWhen BusinessDay visited the PUs at the PTF Estate in Wuse 2 and Onitsha Crescent in Asokoro, there were no voters, though the poll officials including, security operatives were on the ground.\n\nAlso at PU 005 -Garki Village, New Primary School School II just about 25 voters out of the 2, 983 registered voters were on the queue. Only 38 votes were cast at PU004 -Old Karu palace with a total of 2,850 voters while only one registered voter who identified himself as Maro Damian turned out at the PU 051-FCDA quarters after 12 noon.\n\nAt PU02- Garki by Wine Shop, none of the seven registered voters turned up as at the time BusinessDay visited, just as observed at the newly created PUs 011 and 025 located at Nyanya market and Morning Star Hotel, Nyanya in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).\n\n\u201cWe have this long-standing issue of non-indigenes not wanting to come out and vote during area council elections,\u201d said a voter who simply identified himself as Ahmed.\n\nThe creation of new PUs also disenfranchised many voters, some of whom were unaware of their new polling units and were turned back by officials.\n\nHabakkuk Ibrahim, a PDP Agent at the polling unit 027, Kuje, said many voters who were unable to \u201clocate their polling units due to poor sensitisation by the electoral body, went home frustrated.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in polling units, 37/02/02/003, Kuduru Ward, Bwari Area Council outside the city center, voting commenced at about 10 am, but barely 30 persons had voted as at 12:40 pm. That PU has a total of 2642 registered voters.\n\nThough, the situation, BusinessDay gathered was better in some outskirts of Karshi in AMAC; Kuje, Gwagwalada, Bwari and Kwali Area Councils.\n\nApart from the low turnout of voters, the election was equally characterised by dysfunctional BVAS that have been deployed for both fingerprint and facial authentications during accreditation.\n\nIn most of the Polling Units monitored, the devices were either not capturing voters\u2019 fingers and faces or were slow, thereby delaying accreditation and voting. The Kuduru PU for instance had only one BVAS machine for hundreds of voters who gathered. BusinessDay keenly observed that it could take up to 5 minutes to capture and verify one person.\n\nAt PU 001, PU 002, and PU 025 in Nyanya Market, the BVAS were not effective, and the same for PU 05-Gwarinpa where the device could only capture 20 voters to cast their ballot. The Unit has about 1837 registered voters. Also, as at the time BusinessDay visited PU 001-Garki Dispensary, only 17 persons had voted out of 1965 registered, while at PU 017-Ugwan-Bawa in Nyanya a good number of voters turned but could not exercise their franchise for the same reason.\n\nIn Kuchiko/old GSS 004 polling unit, the BVAS machine broke down for at least one hour leaving voters stranded, there was also a very poor internet connection. The entire process was very disorderly despite the presence of security operatives. The situation was the same for Zango and Guto polling units, where voters expressed deep concerns that they may not have the opportunity to exercise their franchise.\n\nOne of the voters, Maimuna Hassan, who lamented that she had to abandon her business to participate in the voting, said the poor functioning of the BVAS was quite frustrating and contributed to many abandoning voting.\n\n\u201cWe are tired; many of our women who came here since morning have gone home. I am just staying back because I want my Chairman to win,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the Presiding Officers, mostly members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who spoke on condition of anonymity, complained that the inefficiency created by the BVAS was very frustrating.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is frustrating. The BVAS are very slow in that it takes more than 10 minutes to accredit one voter. Sometimes, the device will not even capture the fingerprints and faces of the voters. This has made some of them go back. We are thinking of calling the Registration Centre Officials for a solution,\u201d one of the Presiding Officers told BusinessDay.\n\nThe inefficiencies are despite the assurances by INEC that it had reviewed the performance of the BVAS in the recent Anambra State governorship election with a view to improving them for optimal performance in the FCT Polls.\n\nINEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu at the last extended stakeholders meeting ahead of the FCT election on Tuesday said lessons learned from the Anambra election had been considered in planning for the Area Council election.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS have been configured and ready to deploy for the election. We have also made adequate arrangements for technical support and transportation to speedily respond in the unlikely event of glitches,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, there was the late arrival of officials and materials for the election which caused the exercise not to commence, well over one hour after the PUs were supposed to open for accreditation and voting.\n\nIn fact, two hours after the 8:30 am scheduled time for the commencement of the 2022 chairmanship and councillorship elections, voting was yet to commence in the 6 area councils, reason being the non-arrival of INEC officials at the various polling units.\n\nAccreditation and voting were scheduled to start at 8:30 am and close at 2:30 pm but that was not so, as most of the polling units visited by our Correspondent had not opened at the time while the voting continued after the period earmarked.\n\nA visit to most of the centers in Nyanya, Karu, Jikwoyi, Kpeghi, Asokoro, Garki, and Kuduru communities in the Abuja Municipal Area Council, showed no presence of men and materials. In some centers canopies were yet to be erected.\n\nThe story was said to be the same in all the other five Council areas according to our correspondents.\n\nHowever, security agents made up of Police, Civil Defence and Road Safety were seen at the various polling units visited. There was a massive \u201cshow of force\u201d by men of the military and other security agencies around the metropolis ostensibly to ward off criminal elements.\n\nFor instance, at PU 145- Mr. Biggs, Lugbe, the poll officials arrived at 12:45 pm and could not meet a few of the 1,844 registered voters in the unit who had left before their arrival just as the officials also arrived late at 006 -Area C1, 043 -Police Post and 044 -Angwandadi in Nyanya.\n\nA visibly angry party agent, Musbau Ismail told BusinessDay at the Karu Civic center polling unit that he and his colleagues have been waiting for INEC officials since 7 am.\n\n\u201cMy brother as you can see, nothing is happening here. We have been here waiting for them and the materials since 7 am till now 9.05 am,\u201d said.\n\nBusinessDay had earlier reported that the delay was not unconnected with the protests of ad-hoc staff engaged for the exercise over alleged non-payment of their training allowances and replacement by relatives of staff of INEC, Collation, and Returning Officers.\n\nRead also: Abuja area council polls in photos\n\nIt was, however, observed that the polls were generally peaceful as there were no incidents of violence or disruption of the process as at the time of this report except a middle-aged woman allegedly killed by a supporter of one of the political parties who knocked her down with a motorcycle.\n\nThe incident happened close to the PU048 -Salasi, opposite Post Office, Karu in AMAC when the woman, a prospective voter was attempting to cross the road to her polling unit.\n\nThe party supporter whose details are still sketchy was recklessly riding on a motorcycle adorned with the flag of his political party.\n\nThe killer motorcycle rider was immediately apprehended and handed over to security operatives deployed for the election, hence averting the breakdown of law and order.\n\nBusinessDay further noticed an incidence of vote-buying at Jamb headquarters car park unit 10 when a former Senate President of Nigeria, shared some cash to youths which caused chaos and great disorderliness. In polling unit 37/02/02/003, some party agents were giving voters N1,000 and N500 which almost caused commotion.\n\nFurthermore, Covid-19 protocols such as physical distancing and use of face masks were not observed by voters who queued up at most of the PUs visited but the poll officials had hand sanitizers and other protective items provided by INEC.\n\nMore so, restriction of movement was not strictly enforced as usually done at elections due to the conflicting reports from the FCT Command of the Nigeria Police Force; one allowing movement and the other restricting movement.\n\nThe Command had on Thursday announced restriction of movement within the Territory for Saturday, from 12 am to 4 pm, but in a dramatic twist, it canceled the order.\n\nHowever, in a statement issued Friday by Josephine Adeh, the Command Spokesperson, residents were asked to go about their normal duties, which many of the residents claimed they were not aware of.",

          "text": "Sterling Bank Plc, has awarded its HEART Fellowship to five (5) lucky tech founders to enable them to participate in the Founder Institute (FI) Lagos Spring Virtual 2022 Cohort.\n\nThe recipients: Sikiru Salau, Olivia Chukwu, Charles Matthews, Maryann Efiong, and Michael Ayodele have each received a scholarship worth One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) to cover the cost of the program, which is scheduled to run for 14 weeks (February \u2013 June 2022).\n\nThe award recipients are Tech Founders who have demonstrated creativity and employed innovative solutions to tackle challenges in the HEART sectors. The HEART sectors are Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy, and Transportation.\n\nSpeaking at the award ceremony in Lagos on Wednesday, Head, Business Growth and Partnerships with Sterling Bank, Mr. David Adebayo, said the HEART sectors represent the focus and strategy of the bank. According to him, \u201cA critical look at any of the chosen sectors indicates that any action taken to upscale the sectors would have a remarkable impact on the overall economy.\u201d\n\nHe explained that it is because the bank understands it cannot do it alone that a decision was taken to partner with young tech talents in those sectors, that are doing things differently and to help them to scale. The awardees and other participants at the award ceremony were exposed to mentors, including Oluyomi Ojo, Founder, Printivo; Olamide Afolabi, Managing Director, Touch and Pay Technologies Limited; Idowu Akinde, Founder, Boolean Labs, and Seun Abimbola, Co-founder of Rentit, among others.\n\nThe mentors advised the recipients to develop, among other qualities, a positive outlook, be street smart, perseverance and stamina while building fantastic products and relationships as these will increase their odds of achieving amazing outcomes. The recipients were informed that they will have access to fellow Founder Institute Lagos Alumni during the training program, along with exposure to founders from other markets across Africa.\n\nThe mentors advised the awardees to prepare for very rigorous sessions, demonstrating how they could convert their ideas and thoughts into products, adding that they will still need advisors and mentors to guide them on this journey.\n\nDirector, Founder Institute, Lagos Chapter, Wande Adalemo said Founder Institute is the world\u2019s most proven network to turn ideas into fundable startups, and startups into global businesses, adding that the\n\nFounder Institute has helped to launch more than 5,000 companies in more than 200 cities across six continents. He further said FI works by finding great people with great ideas to give devoted support by putting them through a structured growth process and providing them with lifetime support.\n\nAdalemo described FI\u2019s core methodology as a proven process designed to build, rapidly and cost-effectively, through structured and sequential feedback as well as collaborations between founders and the institute\u2019s network of mentors.\n\nThe company was founded in 2009 by serial entrepreneur Adeo Ressi and his colleague, Jonathan Greechan. The idea for the program spawned from operating TheFunded.com, where it became apparent that most entrepreneurs at the idea and launch stages lacked the structure, feedback, and support network needed to succeed. He said FI is presently valued at $25 Billion, with 5,300 alumni, and has raised over $1.5 Billion from investors across the globe. According to him, FI believes there are great entrepreneurs everywhere who can focus, scale, and become part of the global tech system.",

          "title": "Iranian Revolution @43: Strengthening Economic Development Amid Sanctions",
          "text": "The Islamic Republic of Iran has said that amid the crippling economic sanctions imposed by the United States to undermine the integrity of the nation, the ideals espoused by the founding fathers of the great \u2018Islamic Revolution\u2019 of 1979 have endured because of the foresight of the Iranian leaders coupled with the resilience and faith of the people.\n\nThe Ambassador of Iran to Nigeria, Mohammad Alibak reiterated this in a statement to mark the forty-third anniversary of the Iranian Revolution popularly called Iran\u2019s National Day at the weekend.\n\nThe Iranian Revolution was one of the revolts that toppled unpopular Western-backed governments in the 20th century and ushered an era of governments powered by popular demands devoid of imperialist vestiges, which enthroned governance according to the principles of the Islamic religion. The revolution also emboldened the people of Iran and possibly all freedom seekers in the world to assert themselves in world affairs.\n\nAccording Ambassador Alibak, the Islamic Revolution took place at a time when the world was divided between the materialist blocs of East and West, and few thought that an oppressed nation could break the framework and come up with a new plan. But the people of Iran, led by Imam Khomeini were able to oust the Shah, who was a kind of puppet of the Western powers and pursued only their interests in the country and the region, and set up a new course in the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTo reach here, Iranian nation has paved a long way, full of obstacles and barriers, mostly manufactured and set up by those foreign powers that have been refusing to come along with and grasp the new realities of the new Iran. \u201cFrom imposing a deadly war, to launching unending campaigns of economic terrorism, sabotage, and psychological warfare, those powers who were opposed to our revolution, our independence, and our self-reliance, did all they could to stop our popular movement. But the will and resilience of the great and proud nation of Iran was and is, stronger than their schemes. Despite all hardships and ups and downs, grassroots support remains the main source of the power of the Islamic,\u201d he said.\n\nIt has been decades of sanctions imposed by the United States and allies especially on the controversial and coordinated efforts being made by Western powers to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear power, which the nation insists is for peaceful purposes. Under the Barack Obama administration in the US, Iran reached a nuclear deal with five world powers, which inspired confidence about the resolution of the nuclear saga. But as soon as President Donald Trump emerged President in the US, he withdrew the US from the nuclear deal to the consternation of the rest of the world.\n\nAccording to the Iranian envoy \u201cby violating international rules and withdrawing from the nuclear deal between Iran and the five world powers, the United States pursued a policy of maximum pressure and imposed new sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran to defeat the revolution. They used economic terrorism against the Iranian people, a clear example of which was to prevent drugs from entering the country during the Coronavirus epidemic.\n\n\u201cBut these sanctions did cause the great nation of Iran to join hands, and we were able to achieve good achievements during these forty-three years thanks to the efforts of our faithful, educated and revolutionary youth.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is however, to the credit of the Iranian leaders that despite the sanctions, the country has made significant progress in the field of health, and has been able to become a health tourism hub in the region from dependence on foreign doctors, and now people from 53 countries, including Nigeria, travel to Iran for treatment. The country is said to be among the few countries to produce the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe envoy sums up the enormous achievements saying \u201cin the field of science, we are ranked 21st in the world in terms of scientific articles; In terms of nuclear knowledge, we are in the top 5 developed countries in the world; In terms of level of welfare, 100% of urban people and 91% of villagers have access to asphalt roads\n\n\u201cElectricity and water distribution network is established in 99% of villages; Also, 83% of cities and 78% of villages have been supplied with gas network; industrially, the share of industry in GDP has increased from 16% to 40%; Iran\u2019s non-oil exports have increased from $ 54 million to $ 31 billion.\n\n\u201cThe balanced and smart foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is based on the expansion of relations with all countries of the world. Accordingly, in the past year, we have witnessed the development of relations with the friendly country of Nigeria. In this regard, we can point to the multiplication of the volume of economic relations, exchange of economic delegations and conducting meetings and political consultations between the two countries at different levels.\u201d",

          "text": "A former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, has said this is the time for the North to support the presidential ambition of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Daily Trust on Sunday, Shettima, who was one of the three governors of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) that collapsed into the APC at the time of the merger with other political parties ahead of the 2015 general elections, insisted that it is a payback time for Tinubu.\n\nShettima said Tinubu did a lot in actualising the long-time ambition of President Muhammadu Buhari, who defeated President Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBuhari and Tinubu are believed to be the two most important men whose agreement to form the APC, in 2013, and subsequent collaboration led to the Buhari presidency.\n\nThe APC was formed following the merger of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), ANPP, a faction of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and the New Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP).\n\nShettima said Tinubu had supported President Buhari through thick and thin, and one good turn always deserves another.\n\nHe said that before supporting Buhari, the former Lagos State governor shelved his ambition and supported two presidential aspirants from the North \u2013 former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and a former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu, at different times although he had all it took to also vie for the presidency.\n\n\u201cBuhari is immensely popular in the North. He has a cult-like followership of nearly 15 million people. But that never took him to the presidency until we had a handshake across the Niger with the West.\n\n\u201cWrongly, he was assumed to be a northern\u2019 hegemonist\u2019, a provincial politician, even a religious bigot by some of our compatriots in the southern part of the country. It was the South-West political machine that repackaged and resold the Buhari brand to Nigerians in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to mention that when former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was harassed, brutalised and chased out of the PDP, even some of our northern brothers were treating him as a pariah. It was Asiwaju Bola Tinubu that provided him with a sanctuary and platform to contest the 2007 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAgain, four years later, he provided the same platform to another harassed northerner, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu to contest for the presidency under the ACN.\n\n\u201cWithout the block support of the South-West, it would have been difficult for President Buhari to emerge as the candidate of the APC. Tinubu worked for Buhari in 2015 and in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis is why some of us find it utterly disgusting when some of the folks who vigorously worked against Buhari\u2019s ambition in 2014 have done some political somersaults and are now members of what I called Buharist Church of Latter Day Saints, hectoring down on us and liberally dropping the president\u2019s name,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether there was a pact between Buhari and Tinubu before he supported the president\u2019s ambition, Shettima, who has openly declared support for the Jagaban Borgu, said, \u201cIn my view, Asiwaju is sophisticated enough to understand that no one can rely on a futuristic political pact, four or eight years ahead.\n\n\u201cEven a week can be a long time in politics. No one can predict what could happen between now and 2023, let alone predict it as at 2015. In politics you can only guarantee something that is within your immediate reach.\u201d\n\n*Culled from Daily Trust",

Publishing the agreement would enable Nigerians to scrutinise it, seek legal remedies as appropriate, and ensure that the conditions for lifting the suspension of Twitter are not used as pretexts to suppress legitimate discourse\u201d.\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cPublishing the agreement with Twitter would promote transparency, accountability, and help to mitigate threats to Nigerians\u2019 rights online, as well as any interference with online privacy and freedom of expression\u201d.\n\nIt said, \u201cany agreement with social media companies must meet the constitutional requirements of legality, necessity, proportionality, and legitimacy. Secretly agreed terms and conditions will fail these fundamental requirements\u201d.\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari and Alhaji Lai Mohammed to clarify the manner and scope in which the agreement with Twitter will be enforced, and whether the agreement incorporates respect for constitutional and international human rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government has a duty to demonstrate that the conditions for lifting the suspension of Twitter would not threaten or violate the enjoyment of Nigerians\u2019 human rights online and that the conditions are in pursuit of a legitimate goal in a democratic society,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe minister, SERAP added, \u201cresponded to our freedom of information request but his response is completely unsatisfactory, as he merely stated that the \u2018details are in the public space,\u2019 without sending a copy of the agreement signed with Twitter as requested\u201d.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi read in part: \u201cNigerians are entitled to their human rights, such as the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, privacy, peaceful assembly, and association, as well as public participation both offline and online.\n\n\u201cThe operation and enforcement of the agreement may be based on broadly worded restrictive laws, which may be used as pretexts to suppress legitimate discourse, interfere with online privacy, and deter the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statement by the Federal Government announcing the lifting of the suspension of Twitter after seven months used overly broad terms and phrases like \u2018prohibited publication\u2019, \u2018Nigerian laws\u2019, \u2018national culture and history\u2019. These open-ended terms and phrases may be used to suppress the legitimate exercise of human rights online.\n\n\u201cAny agreement with social media companies must not be used as a ploy to tighten government control over access to the internet, monitor internet activity, or to increase online censorship and the capacity of the government to restrict legitimate online content, contrary to standards on freedom of expression and privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantee the right to hold opinions without interference, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any medium.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution and human rights treaties impose duties on the government to ensure enabling environments for freedom of expression, privacy rights, and other human rights, and to protect their exercise.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, it said that \u201cWhile human rights law requires States to prohibit \u2018advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, States must still satisfy the cumulative conditions of legality, necessity, proportionality and legitimacy in any agreement with social media companies.\n\n\u201cThe government has a legal obligation to promote universal Internet access, media diversity and independence, as well as ensure that any agreements with Twitter and other social media companies are not used to impermissibly restrict these fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "An Indian businessman, Vyapak Nutal, has been taken into custody for interrogation by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, over the smuggling of 134,700 bottles of Codeine syrup into the country through the land border between Nigeria and the Niger Republic in Sokoto State.\n\nNDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, in a statement on Sunday said the suspect had loaded the consignment into trucks in Cotonou, Benin Republic, and drove through the land borders via the Niger Republic before entering Sokoto State at the Illela border and settling in at a hotel.\n\nCredible intelligence revealed that Nutal began to look for buyers for the controlled drug. While operatives were on his trail, officers of the Department of State Security apprehended him and swiftly handed him over to NDLEA on Wednesday 10th February 2022.\n\nIn a related development, attempts by drug traffickers to export large quantities of Heroin, Methamphetamine, Khat, Tramadol, and Cannabis through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA, as well as three courier companies in Lagos have been frustrated by narcotic officers who intercepted the illicit consignments.\n\nREAD ALSO: Military School Ex-Boys Join Drug War, Support NDLEA\n\nAt the Lagos airport, operatives on Tuesday 8th Feb arrested one Felix Rotimi Eshemokhai with 1.75kg heroin while trying to board Royal Air Maroc to Casablanca, Morocco. This was as another trafficker, Okafor Emmanuel Onuzuruike, was nabbed the same day in his bid to travel on RwandAir to Dubai with 2.2kg of Cannabis concealed in foodstuff.\n\nNo less than 25 kilograms of Methamphetamine, Tramadol, Cannabis, and Khat concealed in motor parts, MP3 player, speaker, and fabrics heading to the USA, UK, Australia, Dubai, and Madagascar were seized at three major courier companies in Lagos.\n\nIn Gombe state, 31,000 capsules of Tramadol were recovered from a truck that left Onitsha, Anambra state for Mubi, Adamawa State, and the owner, Ibrahim Tukur Bage, was arrested on Friday 11th February while attempting to escape. This followed the arrest of Aliu Salami, 43, with 143.9kg cannabis at Oke-Ata, Abeokuta South LGA, Ogun state on Wednesday 9th Feb.\n\nIn the same vein, not even a bunch of talisman (charms) used by a trans-border drug dealer, Shu\u2019aibu Salisu, could save him and his gang as their consignment of 578kg of Cannabis meant for the Niger Republic was intercepted in Kwara state on 8th Feb when two persons: Gambo Lawal and Ibrahim Mohammed were arrested while conveying the drug to someone in Charanchi, Katsina State.\n\nA follow-up operation led to the arrest of Salisu and two others; Sani Musa and Auwal Amina the day after at different locations within Kaita LGA, Katsina.\n\nIn Benue state, a fake security agent, Mr. Dennis Emadiong, was on Saturday 12th Feb arrested at the NDLEA checkpoint, Alaide, Benue with 239 grams of Cannabis and 10 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunition while on his way from Akwa Ibom to Maiduguri, Borno state. Another suspect, Stephen Folorunsho, was also nabbed during a routine stop and search operation, along Apir-Makurdi road with 147 compressed blocks of Cannabis weighing 130kg stuffed inside bales of used clothes popularly called Okrika on his way to Gombe State.\n\nMeanwhile, in Adamawa State, no fewer than 22,700 tablets of Tramadol and Exol-5 were seized in the Numan area of the state from two drug dealers: Mmaduabuchibeya Kingsley and Onyeke Kenneth in separate raids on Thursday 10th February.\n\nWhile commending the officers and men of Sokoto, Gombe, Ogun, Kwara, Adamawa, Benue, MMIA commands as well as those of the Directorate of Operation and General Investigation, DOGI, for their resilience in the various drug supply reduction efforts, the Chairman/CEO of the agency, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa, charged them and their compatriots across other commands to remain on the offensive against the cartels.\n\nHe also hailed the synergy and support from other security agencies.\n\nSee more photos of the suspects below:",

          "text": "As reactions continue to trail Friday\u2019s judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying President Muhhamadu Buhari\u201ds Executive Order 10 (E10), which directed the implementation of financial autonomy for the states\u2019 judiciary and legislature, senior lawyers have described the judgment as one that was neither won nor lost by parties in the suit.\n\nSenior lawyers, who spoke on the implications of the judgment, were of the opinion that it is the constitution that is rather the winner in the legal battle between the federal and the state governments.\n\nThe apex court had in a split decision of six-to-one, held that the president exceeded his powers when he initiated the E10 to compel the governors of the 36 states to implement the constitutional provisions on financial autonomy of the states\u2019 judiciary and legislature.\n\nIn his apparent bid to deepen democracy in the country, and in response to the agitations of judiciary workers, President Buhari had in 2020 signed into law the Executive Order 10 to compel the states to implement the provisions of Section 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nSpecifically, E10 directs the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct from the allocations due to a state from the Federation Account, any sums appropriated for the legislature or judiciary of that state, which the state fails to release to its legislature or judiciary as the case may be and to pay the funds directly to the state\u2019s legislature or judiciary concerned.\n\nThe move it was believed would curtail the alleged dominance of the state executive over the two other arms of government.\n\nBut the states through their\n\nAttorneys-General swiftly approached the court to challenge the legality of the presidential order, insisting that it was unconstitutional and should be voided.\n\nHowever, the seven-man panel of justices of the apex court, which heard the matter held divergent positions leading to split decisions on the two issues raised before the court.\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit on Friday, six justices of the apex court agreed with the position of the plaintiffs that President Buhari exceeded his powers by initiating and signing the law.\n\nAccording to the majority decision, the Executive Order 10 was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\nThose who held this view include: Justices Muhammed Dattijo, Centus Nweze, Ejembi Eko, Adamu Jairo, Helen Ogunwunmiju and Emmanuel Agim.\n\n\n\nThe court subsequently voided E10 signed into law by President Buhari in 2020.\n\nReacting to the Supreme Court decision on the ARISE NEWS Morning Show, Mr. Abiodun Owonikoko (SAN), was emphatic that there was no winner or loser in the legal contest between the federal government and the states. \u201cIt is not anybody\u201ds loss, it is the constitution that has won,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, although the judgment came in form of anti-climax, the federal government should be commended for making the various state government activate the provisions of Section 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the executive arm of government has achieved its objective, the judiciary vindicated,\u201d since the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum has agreed with both the judiciary and the federal government to implement the provisions by enacting fund management law for the purpose of the independence of the legislature and the judiciary.\n\nResponding to questions whether the judiciary did not enter judgment foreclosing its own independence when it nullified the E10 which appeared to be in its favour, Owonikoko replied, \u201cThe court has not ruled against itself because before the executive order, it has been a matter of executive discretion by the various states\u2019 government, how much and in what manner monies due to the other two arms of government are released whereas the Constitution at that time expressly by the amendment made in 2017, took that discretion out of the hands of the governors\u201d.\n\nHe explained that because most of the state legislators were in the pockets of the governors they were unable to assert themselves, adding that the constitution itself was not a self-executing instrument, thereby necessitating the need for some form of framework by which one can judge compliance with Section 121(3).\n\n\u201cNow, the governors by assenting to the various fund management bills that were initiated by consent of all of them at the level of the governors\u2019 forum can no longer exercise those powers because there are bodies set up which will start with budget preparation, budget allocation and then appropriation.\n\n\u201cOnce the appropriation is done in form of financial bill in the state houses of assembly, the governor has no say anymore. Whatever is due from the consolidated revenue to it or the other arms of government go directly from the accountant general of the state to their account\u2019s management bodies. In the court, the heads of the courts and the chief registrar manage the finances of the courts.|\n\nAlso reacting, another senior lawyer, Reverend John Baiyeshea (SAN), noted that the simple implication of the judgment is that the constitutional provisions on the subject matter shall prevail.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari had initiated E10 \u201cout of genuine concern (as a result of agitations and long strike actions by JUSUN for the enforcement/implementation of same).\n\nHe however, agreed with the majority judgment that since the Constitution has covered the field, the Executive Order 10 made by the President becomes unnecessary.\n\n\u201cActually, the issue of autonomy of the judiciary as provided for in the Constitution is with regards to control of the funds budgeted for the Judiciary. State governors over the years have always hijacked the funds of the judiciary and they will now be giving pittance to judiciary as if doing them a favour.\n\n\u201cThe governors derive enormous pleasure in exercising power to control the judiciary. The judiciary is never in charge of their affairs. If you cannot control your fund, you are not independent.\n\n\u201cSo, it is all about independence of the judiciary. The same governors who have been frustrating the full implementation of the autonomy for the Judiciary \u2018rushed\u2019 to Court to challenge Executive Order 10, which the President made to strengthen the independence of the Judiciary.\n\nFor Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN), \u201cthe plain implication of it is that the EO10 is now non-existent in the eye of the law and not binding on the states.\n\n\u201cIt is a decision of the apex court of the land against which there is no appeal. In the circumstance, the states are at liberty to continue with the issue of funding the judicial sector as they may choose or consider appropriate\u201d.\n\nHe however, noted that the only remedy lies with the amendment of the Constitution. \u201cUntil then, the status quo continue,\u201d he added.\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) will on Monday commence the sale of forms to all aspirants vying for national offices ahead of the party\u2019s national convention slated for February 26.\n\nThis is coming as the cracks in the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) have widened over the choice of a consensus national chairman of the ruling party.\n\nIn the schedule of activities released by the party and signed by the Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, the purchase of forms will take place at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe party said: \u201cSale of Forms to all aspirants vying for National Offices (APC National Secretariat) \u2013 14/02/2022. Submission of completed forms and accompanying documents (APC National Secretariat) \u2013 on or before 19/02/2022.\u201d\n\nIt added that the publication of the members of the sub-committees for the national convention is scheduled to take place on February 19, 2022, while screening of all aspirants vying for national offices would take place between February 20 and 22, 2022.\n\nThe party noted that the screening appeal committees to hear and resolve complaints arising from the screening exercise would be held on February 23.\n\nHowever, following the recent inauguration of state executives of the party, which has further polarised the ruling party, indications have emerged yesterday that the ruling APC is doing all it can to avoid an elective convention.\n\nHowever, there appears to be cracks in the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum over the choice of a consensus national chairman.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the cracks widened after two North-west governors allegedly presented their choice of a consensus chairman for the party to the presidency without the knowledge of the other APC governors.\n\nIt was learnt that the two governors presented their choice to the Presidency but other APC governors rejected the choice.\n\nA source privy to the political horse trading told THISDAY that the Presidency told the two governors to meet the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee, Governor Mai Bala Buni and other members of the committee to discuss and agree on the options that met its (presidency) criteria.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the consensus arrangement was being considered in order to reduce the acrimony within the party.\n\nMeanwhile, some chairmanship aspirants have disagreed on the mode of election of the new national leaders of the party.\n\nWhile some aspirants promised to align with the decision of the leadership of the party, others said they would prefer an elective convention to elect the chairman of the ruling party.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the Senator representing Niger East and a chairmanship aspirant, Senator Sani Musa, said the mode of election would depend on the provision of the law.\n\nAlso, the former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari said he wouldn\u2019t mind if he emerges as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nYari, who spoke through his Chief of Staff, Mr. Abdulkarim Tsafe, told THISDAY that he would prefer an elective convention.\n\n\u201cIf he is the consensus candidate, then good but we\u2019ll prefer to go for elective convention. It is very good if the party leadership will consult the aspirants on the mode of the convention.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the mode of the election, another aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha said the decision on the options lies squarely with the leadership and stakeholders of the party.\n\nMustapha, who spoke through his media aide, Mr. Dapo Okubanjo, told THISDAY that as an aspirant, he has done his best to canvass the support of stakeholders of the party across the country, particularly the delegates.\n\n\u201cSo, whichever method the stakeholders adopt at the convention, be it consensus or elective, we believe that our candidate is the candidate to beat.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, stated that all the aspirants should go into the field for the best candidate to emerge as chairman.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are many and anyone can be chairman but not everyone can lead this party. All the people seeking to be chairman are qualified but only one person will emerge. It is a family thing and we will all go to the field. And party members will elect who they deem fit.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "Chelsea Become Club World Champions as Late Havertz Penalty Ends Palmeiras\u2019 Resistance",
          "text": "Once again, Kai Havertz was the match-winner.\n\nOn Saturday evening in Abu Dhabi, the man who scored the only goal in last May\u2019s Champions League final stepped up to take one of the most important penalties in his club\u2019s history, and cooly stroked the ball past Palmeiras goalkeeper Weverton to claim the Club World Cup for the Blues.\n\nNo wonder they call him King Kai. In less than a year, he\u2019s crowned Chelsea champions of both Europe and the world.\n\nChelsea fans have long sung that they\u2019ve won it all. But they hadn\u2019t until Havert\u2019s extra-time spot-kick at the 40,000 seater Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium.\n\nFinally, owner Roman Abramovich, who was in attendance, has got his hands on the Club World Cup trophy, making it 20 titles in 19 years of the Russian\u2019s rule.\n\nChelsea will receive an estimated \u00a34m ($5m) for winning the FIFA-organised tournament but that will obviously mean little to a man that has spent over \u00a31 billion ($1.35bn) on players turning the Blues into world-beaters.\n\nIndeed, as well as Havertz, another big signing also played a pivotal role, with Romelu Lukaku opening the scoring early in the second half with his 10th goal of the season.\n\nHowever, Thiago Silva handled the ball in his own box in the 61st minute, allowing Raphael Veiga to level matters from 12 yards out.\n\nThe winner came from another handball, as Chelsea\u2019s pressure finally told.\n\nBy the time Havertz scored with three minutes of extra time remaining, manager Thomas Tuchel was on his third formation and had already used all five substitutes.\n\nHis changes worked, just, meaning the German \u2013 who arrived just before the game after recovering from Covid-19 \u2013 has now won three cups since succeeding Frank Lampard at the helm just over a year ago.\n\nThis latest triumph was as difficult as the final scoreline suggested, though.\n\nPalmeiras coach Abel Ferreira brought up the massive difference in budgets before the game, telling reporters, \u201c[Chelsea] are a team that that has spent \u00a3545m ($740m) to be in this competition. Palmeiras spent \u00a329m ($39m).\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cBut I believe \u2013 and my players believe.\u201d\n\nTheir fans clearly did, too. Chelsea\u2019s players had to deal with an intense atmosphere but they proved their mettle in a deserved victory.\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante can now boast of being a world champion for club and country, while Cesar Azpilicueta became the first Chelsea player to complete a clean sweep of honours.\n\nAntonio Rudiger was arguably man of the match, though, showing why the Blues are now willing to make him the highest-paid defender in the club\u2019s history.\n\nTuchel and his players will now be targeting more silverware, with Chelsea set to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final later this month.\n\nThe Blues\u2019 Premier League title challenge may have faltered over Christmas, but there\u2019s a belief behind the scenes that Tuchel can break the boom-and-bust cycle at Stamford Bridge, given his success and excellent working relationship with those behind the scenes.\n\nFor example, he didn\u2019t complain when Chelsea refused to sign another wing-back on a permanent transfer in January, despite Ben Chilwell being out for the rest of the season.\n\nTuchel is a good fit for Chelsea. He understands how things work at the club and he has every chance of staying longer than the 18 months Chelsea managers average under Abramovich.\n\nIndeed, he\u2019s now provided his boss with the one trophy he was missing and there is an undeniable feeling that there are even more titles to come for Tuchel and his young side.\n\nGoal",

          "text": "Following the circulation of adulterated petrol in Nigeria, which damaged vehicle engines last week, the federal government has turned back two tankers carrying petrol loaded in Antwerp, Belgium, and destined for Lagos.\n\nThis is coming as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nThe off-specification fuel, it was learnt, was rejected amid the raging controversy over the bad fuel in circulation in the country, which led to the disruption of the country\u2019s supply chain, resulting in long queues in filling stations across the country.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol, which grounded movements in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, was made worse by the shortage of inventory, according to the figures released by the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC).\n\n\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAs at Saturday, majority of filling stations in Abuja were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open.\n\nThe imported cargoes were said to have high methanol content, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, after over 100 million litres were said to have been in circulation.\n\nBut quoting Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking and other sources, Reuters reported that the two tankers, STI SYMPHONY and VELOS DIAMANTIS, were turned back by the federal government against the backdrop of other petrol cargoes loaded in Antwerp for containing too much methanol.\n\nAccording to a fixture list from a ship broker and Refinitiv Eikon data, Litasco chartered the STI SYMPHONY for January 15 to take 90,000 tonnes of petrol to West Africa.\n\nThe STI SYMPHONY loaded petrol in Antwerp around January 22 before sailing to Lagos, but has now been turned back, according to the Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking.\n\nHowever, the tanker did a U-turn off the coast of Guinea on February and is now heading back to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub, Reuters reported.\n\nAccording to the report, NNPC did not respond to a request for comment. Litasco had previously said it does not comment on trading activities and did not immediately respond to a query on the STI Symphony.\n\nThe VELOS DIAMANTIS, carrying 60,000 tonnes, and allegedly chartered by Mercuria, did a U-turn on February 4, after showing Lagos as its destination, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed. A Mercuria source, however, said the company no longer owns the tanker\u2019s cargo.\n\nThe NNPC had while labouring to absolve itself of complicity in the importation and distribution of millions of litres of the bad product into the country, named Belgium as the country of origin of the adulterated fuel.\n\nAmid the damage done to vehicles in some states in the country, the federal government had vowed to investigate the matter with a view to bringing the culprits to book.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, however, stated that from his investigation, the four petrol cargoes were imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.\n\nAll the companies mentioned, aside Duke Oil, the NNPC\u2019s trading arm, have since denied complicity.\n\nIronically, Kyari had maintained that the cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with the Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\nHe stated that all defaulting suppliers had been put on notice for remedial actions, stressing that the NNPC would work with other stakeholders to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\nHe did not explain what \u201cfurther necessary action\u201d would be taken even after saying that there was no national standard for methanol in the fuel imported into Nigeria.\n\nThe decision to reject the cargoes also came days after President Muhammadu Buhari expressed anger over the importation and circulation of the contaminated petrol in the country.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the President had therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, be queried immediately.\n\nNNPC had also in January announced that it received four tankers carrying unusable petrol that was loaded in Belgium by Litasco, the trading arm of Russia\u2019s Lukoil, and sold to local traders.\n\n\n\nThe fuel was found to contain too much methanol and was removed from circulation, causing shortages nationwide.\n\nFollowing the incident, the NNPC banned methanol content in future petrol deliveries. Previously, traders said Nigeria did not specify methanol content. Methanol is sometimes added to petrol in small amounts because it is a cheaper, and cleaner burning fuel that also optimises engine functioning.\n\nAlthough methanol, in small amounts, is a regular petrol additive, the industry\u2019s regulator said the supplier of the off-specification petrol was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortia THISDAY learnt, receives some quantities of crude oil in exchange for petrol.\n\nEmbattled Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, during the week, stated that the NNPC had received a delivery of 300 million litres to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nThe NMDPRA boss had further stated that the country currently has petrol that can last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, OPEC and its allies have continued to produce crude oil below their oil production targets, with the group\u2019s output falling by a record 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its collective quotas in January.\n\nAn S&P Global Platts survey indicated that OPEC\u2019s 13 countries raised output by 150,000 bpd from December, pumping 28.19 million bpd of crude, while the nine non-OPEC partners, led by Russia, only managed to add a meagre 10,000 bpd, producing 13.99 million bpd.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s underperformance continued even as there appears to be no end in sight to the rising prices of oil occasioned by tightening supply and growing demand for the commodity, mainly on the back of growing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nOil traders have continued to be rattled by reports that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could take place within days and bid up oil prices to over $95 in large trading volumes.\n\nTraders fear disruptions of oil and natural gas flows from Russia to Europe in case a war begins, either directly from blown-up pipelines or halted flows, or indirectly when energy trade gets caught up in sanctions.\n\nRussia delivers Europe with one-third of its natural gas needs and exports around 2 million bpd of both crude oil and refined products to European nations.\n\nAccording to the OPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for January, released this week, Nigeria struggled to pump 1.399 million bpd out of the total allocation, quoting primary (direct) sources.\n\nThis was in contrast to December 2021, when it pumped 1.197 million barrels per day and November when it was only able to produce 1.275 million bpd.\n\nThe biggest increases in crude oil production came from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, while output declined in OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer Iraq, as well as in Venezuela and Libya.\n\nBut in all, S&P stated that 14 out of the 18 members with quotas underproduced their targets, pushing OPEC+ compliance to 120.8 per cent, the highest since the group instituted record output cuts in April 2020 to pull the oil market out of its pandemic crash.\n\nDespite strong gains from the group\u2019s core Gulf members and Russia, disruptions in several OPEC+ countries, including Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Libya and Iraq, limited the bloc\u2019s growth in January, it stated.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
