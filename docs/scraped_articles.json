          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nAfrica is set to miss the urgent global goal of vaccinating the most vulnerable 10 per cent of every country\u2019s population against COVID-19 by the end of September.\n\nForty-two of Africa\u2019s 54 nations\u2014nearly 80 per cent\u2014are set to miss the target if the current pace of vaccine deliveries and vaccinations hold, new data from the World Health Organisation shows.\n\nWHO disclosed this latest data in a press statement released on Thursday and made available to PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nAccording to the statement released by WHO\u2019s Africa office, nine African countries, including South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia, have already reached the global target set in May by the World Health Assembly, the world\u2019s highest health policy-setting body.\n\nAt the current pace, three more African countries are set to meet the target. Two more could meet it if they speed up vaccinations.\n\n\u201cWith less than a month to go, this looming goal must concentrate minds in Africa and globally.\n\n\u201cVaccine hoarding has held Africa back and we urgently need more vaccines, but as more doses arrive, African countries must zero in and drive forward precise plans to rapidly vaccinate the millions of people that still face a grave threat from COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\n\nAlmost 21 million COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Africa via the COVAX Facility in August, an amount equal to the previous four months combined. With more vaccines expected from COVAX and the African Union by the end of September, we could see enough doses delivered to meet the 10 percent target.\n\nWhile many African countries have sped up COVID-19 vaccinations as vaccine shipments ramped up in August, 26 countries have used less than half of their COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nOver 143 million doses have been received in Africa in total and 39 million people\u2014around just three per cent of Africa\u2019s population\u2014are fully vaccinated. In comparison, 52 per cent of people are fully vaccinated in the United States of America and 57% in the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe inequity is deeply disturbing. Just two per cent of the over five billion doses given globally have been administered in Africa.\n\n\u201cYet recent rises in vaccine shipments and commitments shows that a fairer, more just global distribution of vaccines looks possible,\u201d said Dr. Moeti.\n\nThe world health body noted that countries must continue to address operational gaps and continually improve, adapt and refine their COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.\n\n\u201cOf the 30 countries that have submitted data to WHO on operational readiness, one in two have not conducted intra-action reviews, which are key to assessing and fine-tuning progress. One in three countries have not updated their National Vaccine Deployment Plans, which instruct all COVID-19 vaccination actions in each country.\n\n\u201cWHO is providing tailored policy advice and technical guidance and support to African countries to help enhance their logistics, planning and monitoring capacities. WHO is also working to share valuable lessons and experiences between countries,\u201d it said.\n\nWHO noted that COVID-19 cases are declining slightly in Africa but remain stubbornly high.\n\nIt said a rising number of new cases in Central, East and West Africa pushed case numbers up to nearly 215,000 in the week ending on 29 August.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five countries\u2014over 45 per cent of African countries\u2014are reporting high or fast-rising case numbers. Over 5,500 deaths were reported in the week ending on 29 August.\n\n\u201cAlthough Africa\u2019s third wave peaked in July, the decline in new cases is at a glacial pace\u2014far slower than in previous waves. The pandemic is still raging in Africa and we must not let our guard down. Every hour 26 Africans die of COVID-19,\u201d WHO said.\n\nThe highly transmissible Delta variant has been found in 31 African countries. The Alpha variant has been detected in 44 countries and the Beta variant in 39, WHO said.\n\nThe C.1.2 variant has been identified in 114 cases in South Africa. Single cases have been found in four other African countries, and very low case numbers have been reported internationally. While first reported to WHO in July, the prevalence of this new variant remains very low. To be identified as a variant of concern there must be evidence of an impact on transmissibility, severity or immunity. This is not the case for the C.1.2 variant, yet more data is required.\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring the spread and evolution of all reported variants of COVID-19, including C.1.2. Mask wearing, physical distancing and regular hand washing will help keep you safe from all variants,\u201d said Dr. Moeti.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Behold HRM Ogiame Atuwatse III\u2026.King With Vision And Mission",
          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nYesterday, history was made as the Itsekiri people trooped out en masse and converged in their ancestral home, Ode-Itsekiri popularly called big Warri, to crown their new king. Known for their elegant and flamboyant dressing, the Itsekiri put up the finest of their rich culture and tradition as colourful boat regattas displayed on Warri high seas, an event specially reserved for special occasions such as the coronation of a king, preceded the coronation rights.\n\nPHOTO By: Henry Unini\n\nPrince Tsola Emiko, who, until yesterday was referred to as Omoba, after spending 90 days in seclusion in which he was educated on Itsekiri culture and custom, as well as kingship etiquettes was crowned the 21st Olu of Warri after picking the royal title of Ogiame Atuwatse III.\n\nBorn Utienyinoritsetsola Emiko in Warri, Delta State, on April 2, 1984, to Prince Godwin Toritseju Emiko, the late Ogiame Atuwatse II, and Gladys Durorike Emiko, he had his early education at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Primary School and Adesoye College in Offa, Kwara State between 1995 and 2000.\n\nIn 2002, he then proceeded to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and Political Science with minors in History and Economics. He followed it up with a Masters degree in Science in Management from the same university in 2007 before returning to Nigeria for his NYSC in 2008, where he worked in the Public Affairs Department of the National Petroleum Investment Management Service (NAPIMS).\n\nThe handsome king who social media enthusiasts tagged \u201cpretty king\u201d for his good looks, is married to Ivie Okunbo, now Olori, the daughter of billionaire Capt. Idahosa Okunbor who recently passed away after battling with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAn accomplished businessman and CEO of Noble Nigeria Souvenir Limited now Ogiame Atuwatse III, he speaks exclusively to Vanguard on the stormy journey to the throne and his vision and mission to his beloveth Itsekiri people.\n\nHIS ROYAL MAJESTY, TESOLA EMIKO, ATUWATSE III, THE OLU OF WARRI KINGDOM\n\nYour Majesty, let me start by congratulating you on your acension to the throne of your forefathers as the 21st Olu of Warri. It\u2019s your Thanksgiving ceremony today. What are you most grateful for?\n\nLife. Health and a dream come true.\n\nYesterday, history was made in Itsekiri land. As the person at the center, what was the whole experience like for you?\n\nIt was dreamlike, surreal, and inspirational for myself and many others who I\u2019m sure are encouraged that something promised, no matter the obstacles or setbacks, that it can, and will, come to pass.\n\nYesterday\u2019s colourful ceremony is a testament of the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people. How and in what ways do you intend to continue this legacy?\n\nI think we witnessed some new things that we introduced by way of organization, procession, music and visuals in the ceremony. Those are a testament of many more additions to come. I plan to do many unprecedented things that will enhance, and promote, the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people.\n\nYour father and grand father were Olus who reigned long and enjoyed the love and support of the Itsekiri people. Do you fear if their shoes might be too big for you to fill?\n\nWell, certainly, they\u2019ve left huge boots to fill. However, I know that God\u2019s hand is very much in my ascension to the throne. The same One who saw it fit to put me here will keep me, and help me to lead and serve the people He has called me to.\n\nIf HM Atuwatse were here, what would he be most proud of?\n\nHe would be proud that I trusted God. I kept my peace and pursued peace. He always said a baby elephant doesn\u2019t struggle to grow. Without struggling, here we are.\n\nOne of the things you had going for you was the fact that you grew up in kingship and had the privilege of seeing your late father administer his kingdom. What was it like growing up in the palace as a young prince?\n\nTo be honest, it was a very normal household. My parents did their best to keep us \u201cgrounded\u201d and raise us just like any other children. They were intentional, to ensure that we didn\u2019t grow up proud or entitled because of our status. However, as they say, greatness is never taught, it is caught. While nothing was formally taught, I observed everything about my father: his unwavering love for his people, his ethics, his integrity, his speech, his demeanor and his carriage. I like to believe I caught all these principles from him.\n\nWhat fascinated you most?\n\nThe grace by which he appeared to carry it all with so much ease and poise.\n\nAs a king in a digital age, how do you hope to cope with the rigid demands of culture and tradition?\n\nTechnology is here to make our lives as a race easier. So, we will find ways to apply technology to enhance and ease our already numerous responsibilities. Open mindedness and willingness to adapt will make all the difference.\n\nYour journey to the throne was quite a stormy one. What was it like being in the center of it all?\n\nTo quote a song, \u201cIn the eye of the hurricane, there is quiet\u201d. There was a certain peace I had in the eye of the storm. A peace I still very much have.\n\nNow that the storm is over, what plans do you have to bring all Itsekiris together again as one?\n\nNo victor, no vanquished. We are one big body, and there are different parts that have different functions: we will ensure those suited to roles are given those roles; and a giant toe that feels it\u2019s so prominent because of whatever blessings it has, shouldn\u2019t feel it must be the center of the forehead because it\u2019s a giant in its sense. Everyone has a role to play, and we will ensure those roles are well applied. We will function together as one to bring progress and development to our kingdom.\n\nOne major problem facing Itsekiris is community crises, you also have crises between youths of the three major ethnic groups in Warri. What plans do you have to ensure a permanent end to these crises?\n\nFor a people to co-exist, there must be mutual respect for each other as individuals. Mutual respect for each other\u2019s boundaries, customs and culture. It\u2019s a shared environment, we should see our problems as the same. We should also see our development as a shared and mutually intertwined one. That way, we are invested in ensuring there is peace all around. I am a man of peace and I will seek to bring peace and unity between the Itsekiris and our neighbours.\n\nLack of employment is a huge problem in the kingdom. How do you plan to help these teaming youths in order to prevent them from youth restiveness?\n\nBeing a young king, I have particular interest in the youth in my kingdom. They are our Nation builders, and will help build the Itsekiri Nation of the future. I have a few unconventional initiatives in the pipeline to address the issue of youth restiveness. Without giving away too much, I will say this; there is profit in every labour. Not everyone can get into the IOCs or banks or telecoms. With innovative thinking, we will create our own local economy without trying to over saturate what is already on ground. We will also set up schemes and structures to enable optimal output of large, medium and small scale industries already in operation.\n\nShare with us your immediate plans for the Itsekiri people?\n\nA reorientation of the mind. A wise man once said, to know where you are going, you must know where you are coming from. The warri crisis made many of our people to lose the essence of themselves. As the primary custodian of Itsekiri culture and an avid lover of history, I desire to bring a renaissance of our identity and purpose as a people. We will revisit foundations to enlighten and educate the people of our true identity. If we don\u2019t get those foundations correct, whatever you attempt to build will not be sustainable. We will get our foundations right.\n\nYou experienced one of the worst forms of discrimination by reason of the circumstances of your birth. Going forward, how would you ensure that no law or edict carries such descriminatory clauses?\n\nThe motto of our reign as revealed yesterday is Righteousness and Justice. We will use that foundation to view everything that concerns us as a people.

          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nYesterday, history was made as the Itsekiri people trooped out en masse and converged in their ancestral home, Ode-Itsekiri popularly called big Warri, to crown their new king. Known for their elegant and flamboyant dressing, the Itsekiri put up the finest of their rich culture and tradition as colourful boat regattas displayed on Warri high seas, an event specially reserved for special occasions such as the coronation of a king, preceded the coronation rights.\n\nPHOTO By: Henry Unini\n\nPrince Tsola Emiko, who, until yesterday was referred to as Omoba, after spending 90 days in seclusion in which he was educated on Itsekiri culture and custom, as well as kingship etiquettes was crowned the 21st Olu of Warri after picking the royal title of Ogiame Atuwatse III.\n\nBorn Utienyinoritsetsola Emiko in Warri, Delta State, on April 2, 1984, to Prince Godwin Toritseju Emiko, the late Ogiame Atuwatse II, and Gladys Durorike Emiko, he had his early education at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Primary School and Adesoye College in Offa, Kwara State between 1995 and 2000.\n\nIn 2002, he then proceeded to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and Political Science with minors in History and Economics. He followed it up with a Masters degree in Science in Management from the same university in 2007 before returning to Nigeria for his NYSC in 2008, where he worked in the Public Affairs Department of the National Petroleum Investment Management Service (NAPIMS).\n\nThe handsome king who social media enthusiasts tagged \u201cpretty king\u201d for his good looks, is married to Ivie Okunbo, now Olori, the daughter of billionaire Capt. Idahosa Okunbor who recently passed away after battling with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAn accomplished businessman and CEO of Noble Nigeria Souvenir Limited now Ogiame Atuwatse III, he speaks exclusively to Vanguard on the stormy journey to the throne and his vision and mission to his beloveth Itsekiri people.\n\nHIS ROYAL MAJESTY, TESOLA EMIKO, ATUWATSE III, THE OLU OF WARRI KINGDOM\n\nYour Majesty, let me start by congratulating you on your acension to the throne of your forefathers as the 21st Olu of Warri. It\u2019s your Thanksgiving ceremony today. What are you most grateful for?\n\nLife. Health and a dream come true.\n\nYesterday, history was made in Itsekiri land. As the person at the center, what was the whole experience like for you?\n\nIt was dreamlike, surreal, and inspirational for myself and many others who I\u2019m sure are encouraged that something promised, no matter the obstacles or setbacks, that it can, and will, come to pass.\n\nYesterday\u2019s colourful ceremony is a testament of the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people. How and in what ways do you intend to continue this legacy?\n\nI think we witnessed some new things that we introduced by way of organization, procession, music and visuals in the ceremony. Those are a testament of many more additions to come. I plan to do many unprecedented things that will enhance, and promote, the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people.\n\nYour father and grand father were Olus who reigned long and enjoyed the love and support of the Itsekiri people. Do you fear if their shoes might be too big for you to fill?\n\nWell, certainly, they\u2019ve left huge boots to fill. However, I know that God\u2019s hand is very much in my ascension to the throne. The same One who saw it fit to put me here will keep me, and help me to lead and serve the people He has called me to.\n\nIf HM Atuwatse were here, what would he be most proud of?\n\nHe would be proud that I trusted God. I kept my peace and pursued peace. He always said a baby elephant doesn\u2019t struggle to grow. Without struggling, here we are.\n\nOne of the things you had going for you was the fact that you grew up in kingship and had the privilege of seeing your late father administer his kingdom. What was it like growing up in the palace as a young prince?\n\nTo be honest, it was a very normal household. My parents did their best to keep us \u201cgrounded\u201d and raise us just like any other children. They were intentional, to ensure that we didn\u2019t grow up proud or entitled because of our status. However, as they say, greatness is never taught, it is caught. While nothing was formally taught, I observed everything about my father: his unwavering love for his people, his ethics, his integrity, his speech, his demeanor and his carriage. I like to believe I caught all these principles from him.\n\nWhat fascinated you most?\n\nThe grace by which he appeared to carry it all with so much ease and poise.\n\nAs a king in a digital age, how do you hope to cope with the rigid demands of culture and tradition?\n\nTechnology is here to make our lives as a race easier. So, we will find ways to apply technology to enhance and ease our already numerous responsibilities. Open mindedness and willingness to adapt will make all the difference.\n\nYour journey to the throne was quite a stormy one. What was it like being in the center of it all?\n\nTo quote a song, \u201cIn the eye of the hurricane, there is quiet\u201d. There was a certain peace I had in the eye of the storm. A peace I still very much have.\n\nNow that the storm is over, what plans do you have to bring all Itsekiris together again as one?\n\nNo victor, no vanquished. We are one big body, and there are different parts that have different functions: we will ensure those suited to roles are given those roles; and a giant toe that feels it\u2019s so prominent because of whatever blessings it has, shouldn\u2019t feel it must be the center of the forehead because it\u2019s a giant in its sense. Everyone has a role to play, and we will ensure those roles are well applied. We will function together as one to bring progress and development to our kingdom.\n\nOne major problem facing Itsekiris is community crises, you also have crises between youths of the three major ethnic groups in Warri. What plans do you have to ensure a permanent end to these crises?\n\nFor a people to co-exist, there must be mutual respect for each other as individuals. Mutual respect for each other\u2019s boundaries, customs and culture. It\u2019s a shared environment, we should see our problems as the same. We should also see our development as a shared and mutually intertwined one. That way, we are invested in ensuring there is peace all around. I am a man of peace and I will seek to bring peace and unity between the Itsekiris and our neighbours.\n\nLack of employment is a huge problem in the kingdom. How do you plan to help these teaming youths in order to prevent them from youth restiveness?\n\nBeing a young king, I have particular interest in the youth in my kingdom. They are our Nation builders, and will help build the Itsekiri Nation of the future. I have a few unconventional initiatives in the pipeline to address the issue of youth restiveness. Without giving away too much, I will say this; there is profit in every labour. Not everyone can get into the IOCs or banks or telecoms. With innovative thinking, we will create our own local economy without trying to over saturate what is already on ground. We will also set up schemes and structures to enable optimal output of large, medium and small scale industries already in operation.\n\nShare with us your immediate plans for the Itsekiri people?\n\nA reorientation of the mind. A wise man once said, to know where you are going, you must know where you are coming from. The warri crisis made many of our people to lose the essence of themselves. As the primary custodian of Itsekiri culture and an avid lover of history, I desire to bring a renaissance of our identity and purpose as a people. We will revisit foundations to enlighten and educate the people of our true identity. If we don\u2019t get those foundations correct, whatever you attempt to build will not be sustainable. We will get our foundations right.\n\nYou experienced one of the worst forms of discrimination by reason of the circumstances of your birth. Going forward, how would you ensure that no law or edict carries such descriminatory clauses?\n\nThe motto of our reign as revealed yesterday is Righteousness and Justice. We will use that foundation to view everything that concerns us as a people. And with God guiding us, we will effect the necessary change that ensures equity among our people.\n\nTo ensure a good relationship with all Itsekiris, in what ways would you like them to support you? What should they be doing and what should they not be doing?\n\nThey should know, that I am here to serve them. In everything I do, my intent is to always improve and add value to them, by making things better for them. Even, if it may not immediately appear palatable, because sometimes improvement can be uncomfortable or strange, they should trust that it\u2019s with good intention that I take an action or a decision. To conquer new frontiers we must be willing to embrace the foreign sense the unprecedented brings. I am also very open to feedback, and I welcome my people\u2019s input in my assignment to make things better for us as a people.\n\nWhat would you miss most now as the Olu?\n\nMy anonymity! People want to be celebrities so bad in this generation. I\u2019ve always appreciated my \u201canonymity\u201d. Now that it\u2019s been obviously taken away from me, I think that more than anything, this is what I will miss the most.\n\nI thank you for your time and wish you a peaceful reign.",

          "text": "Words by- Josephine Agbonkhese\n\nOur cover personality Mercy Eke needs almost no introduction. Since 2019 when she emerged winner of the Big Brother Naija, BBN, Season 4, Eke has grown in leaps and bounds, evolving from just a reality TV show contestant, to a video vixen, brands\u2019 ambassador, actress and successful real estates entrepreneur.\n\nThe Imo State University graduate is an embodiment of boldness, style and energy; three features that have continued to distinguish and endear her to many.\n\nIn this interview, she speaks of her newly-launched platform for giving back: The Mercy Eke Foundation, life as the only woman to have won the BBN grand prize so far; her love life and much more.\n\nHow has life been since 2019 when you won the Big Brother Naija Season 4?\n\nLife has really been good. Life has been amazing. I can\u2019t take anything for granted. God has been so wonderful to me and I\u2019ve really, really been working hard. So I would say life after Big Brother has been amazing.\n\nHas the win translated into gains as much as you expected?\n\nWell, I would say win plus hard work equals growth. I mean, there\u2019s been a lot of changes and a lot of growth. I\u2019m doing a lot of things. So, yes the win translated into growth.\n\nHow have you been handling the fame and celebrity status/lifestyle that comes with winning?\n\nWell, let me breath in first. It hasn\u2019t been easy. Ah! Celebrities! God! It\u2019s so hard to be a celebrity in Nigeria or in Africa. It\u2019s so hard like, it\u2019s so demanding but, you know, I just have to take it slowly and a step at a time. But we\u2019ll get there.\n\nGrowing up, did you dream of a life of fame?\n\nYes, I did. I had a lot of dreams and one of the major one was being famous. That was why I auditioned four times for BBNaija because I felt that my redemption might come from there; and it did!\n\nYou remain the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition. What do you think women in each editions haven\u2019t realised about winning?\n\nYes, I\u2019m the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition for Big Brother Nigeria. Like I always tell people, it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s not a do or die affair and at the end of the day, there can only be one winner. I tried my best, and Africa and Nigeria were behind me; and they crowned me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how other women see it but for me, I am happy and I can\u2019t wait to welcome the next female winner because my back is already hurting me. I need someone else to join me on that seat.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be the only female winner; so I pray a woman wins this year\u2019s Big Brother Naija.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion of the ongoing BBN Season 6?\n\nI think the season 6 housemates are unique in their own ways, but of course some people stand out more than others. So far, Maria, Whitemoney, Liquorose, Angel and Cross are giving me the vibes. As a BBN fanatic, if I have the power, these will be my top 5, and I will be so happy if any of them ace the game.\n\nDo you see yourself in any of the housemates?\n\nI see myself in Maria, Angel and Whitemoney; selfless, loving and outspoken.\n\nWho has the biggest chance of winning?\n\nThey all stand a chance of winning and may the best man win.\n\nTell us about your recently launched foundation?\n\nYes, I just recently launched my foundation; which has been, one of the things I wanted to do a long time ago. The Mercy Eke Foundation is about giving back to the society; giving back to the people that have nothing, giving back to the people who need it the most, and giving back to the people who made me what I am today. Helping small business owners, helping kids on the streets, single mothers, widows, students and more. So, yes, my foundation is just about giving back to the society.\n\nWhy did it take you this long to set it up?\n\nWell, it took me so long to start up my foundation because I wanted to get it right. I don\u2019t want to start a foundation because everyone has a foundation. I want to do it and I want to do it right, and also impact lives in the process. So, I had to take my time.\n\nHas it always been your dream to formally giveback to society or did this come as an afterthought?\n\nYes, it has been my dream to give back to the society. I\u2019m a giver. My heart is so big; I can\u2019t stand people suffering. I wish I could even do more. And it\u2019s been on my mind to help people; especially people that really need it. Our country is so bad right now that every day, I put this country in my prayers. I just want to see millions of struggling people in this country have at least, two square meals a day. So yes, I\u2019ve been giving, and giving back has always been my thing. I\u2019m glad I am able and I can do this at this point in my life.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen much of you in Nollywood as expected, aside Fate of Alakada, a few skits and in the forthcoming TV series \u2018TRIPS\u2019. What\u2019s happening?\n\nYes. You haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood as expected because coming out as a winner, I had a lot of things I had to do and I have been doing. Like now, I\u2019m currently shooting my reality show, setting up my business, foundation and working as an ambassador for brands I represent.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m doing more of movies. I recently finished shooting a movie, Shanty Town, which is yet to be out. And I did another one Trips, which is a TV series. There\u2019s also another script I\u2019m currently on; so, I\u2019m ready for Nollywood. I think this is the time. And remember, whenever you wake up, it\u2019s your morning. So right now, Nollywood, here comes your girl!\n\nDoes this have anything to do with your venturing into the real estate sector last year with the establishment of Lambo Homes?\n\nYes. I wasn\u2019t accepting the scripts then because I wanted to set up my businesses and also push other things. So, yeah, I think those were the reasons you all haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood.\n\nThe BBN Lockdown Season\u2019s reunion was staged recently; what do you think of the various housemates?\n\nI think all I see is growth and I love it. All of them are doing amazing. I\u2019m so proud of them.\n\nWho was your favourite and why?\n\nI think all of them. You know, they\u2019re all unique in their own ways.\n\nCan you recall your three best moments since 2019?\n\nI think the day I entered the BBN house, the day I came out of the house, and saw my parents from the stage and I was like \u201cMama, I made it\u201d, and also, the day I paid for my first home. These are my three best moments.\n\nYour fans were hopeful about your relationship with Ike Onyeka; what contributed to its crash?\n\nYou know, I was there and I have been there. Breakup happens and it is what it is. What crashed the relationship? I seriously don\u2019t know. I think we were not compatible; so it crashed.\n\nSo who\u2019s the man in your life right now and what do you love most about him?\n\nI can\u2019t mention his name. You know what they say about protecting people you love and cherish? That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I have a handsome, loving man by my side who supports and loves me. What I love about him is that, he is so consistent and intentional about me, and also, he\u2019s not about the social media life. He\u2019s a businessman and I love that he loves God. I just love him.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest regret?\n\nI don\u2019t think I regret anything because everything that has happened to me is either a blessing or a lesson; so, I don\u2019t regret anything.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI have quite a number of people and women who inspire me across the globe. A lot of people inspire me, especially people I can relate with; people I see myself in. People that have been through a lot.\n\nFrom which of your parents did you draw your resilient, goal-getting spirit from?\n\nIt is from my mother; she is a hardworking woman and has been there for my siblings and I despite how we troubled her. My mother inspires me the most; she\u2019s my biggest supporter and she\u2019s my everything.\n\nYou did a butt job; what advice do you have for young women who also want to have cosmetic surgery?\n\nWell, do what makes you happy. Do what you want to do; it\u2019s your body, you call the shot and it is your money \u2014 spend it how you like to. Do whatever makes you happy.\n\nDescribe your style in two words?\n\nMy style in two words will be glam and fun.\n\nWhat do you look forward to? I look forward to greatness, opportunities, more growth, and everything good because I deserve everything good. I also look forward to good health, more business opportunities, open doors and all the good things of life.",

Helping small business owners, helping kids on the streets, single mothers, widows, students and more. So, yes, my foundation is just about giving back to the society.\n\nWhy did it take you this long to set it up?\n\nWell, it took me so long to start up my foundation because I wanted to get it right. I don\u2019t want to start a foundation because everyone has a foundation. I want to do it and I want to do it right, and also impact lives in the process. So, I had to take my time.\n\nHas it always been your dream to formally giveback to society or did this come as an afterthought?\n\nYes, it has been my dream to give back to the society. I\u2019m a giver. My heart is so big; I can\u2019t stand people suffering. I wish I could even do more. And it\u2019s been on my mind to help people; especially people that really need it. Our country is so bad right now that every day, I put this country in my prayers. I just want to see millions of struggling people in this country have at least, two square meals a day. So yes, I\u2019ve been giving, and giving back has always been my thing. I\u2019m glad I am able and I can do this at this point in my life.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen much of you in Nollywood as expected, aside Fate of Alakada, a few skits and in the forthcoming TV series \u2018TRIPS\u2019. What\u2019s happening?\n\nYes. You haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood as expected because coming out as a winner, I had a lot of things I had to do and I have been doing. Like now, I\u2019m currently shooting my reality show, setting up my business, foundation and working as an ambassador for brands I represent.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m doing more of movies. I recently finished shooting a movie, Shanty Town, which is yet to be out. And I did another one Trips, which is a TV series. There\u2019s also another script I\u2019m currently on; so, I\u2019m ready for Nollywood. I think this is the time. And remember, whenever you wake up, it\u2019s your morning. So right now, Nollywood, here comes your girl!\n\nDoes this have anything to do with your venturing into the real estate sector last year with the establishment of Lambo Homes?\n\nYes. I wasn\u2019t accepting the scripts then because I wanted to set up my businesses and also push other things. So, yeah, I think those were the reasons you all haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood.\n\nThe BBN Lockdown Season\u2019s reunion was staged recently; what do you think of the various housemates?\n\nI think all I see is growth and I love it. All of them are doing amazing. I\u2019m so proud of them.\n\nWho was your favourite and why?\n\nI think all of them. You know, they\u2019re all unique in their own ways.\n\nCan you recall your three best moments since 2019?\n\nI think the day I entered the BBN house, the day I came out of the house, and saw my parents from the stage and I was like \u201cMama, I made it\u201d, and also, the day I paid for my first home. These are my three best moments.\n\nYour fans were hopeful about your relationship with Ike Onyeka; what contributed to its crash?\n\nYou know, I was there and I have been there. Breakup happens and it is what it is. What crashed the relationship? I seriously don\u2019t know. I think we were not compatible; so it crashed.\n\nSo who\u2019s the man in your life right now and what do you love most about him?\n\nI can\u2019t mention his name. You know what they say about protecting people you love and cherish? That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I have a handsome, loving man by my side who supports and loves me. What I love about him is that, he is so consistent and intentional about me, and also, he\u2019s not about the social media life. He\u2019s a businessman and I love that he loves God. I just love him.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest regret?\n\nI don\u2019t think I regret anything because everything that has happened to me is either a blessing or a lesson; so, I don\u2019t regret anything.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI have quite a number of people and women who inspire me across the globe. A lot of people inspire me, especially people I can relate with; people I see myself in. People that have been through a lot.\n\nFrom which of your parents did you draw your resilient, goal-getting spirit from?\n\nIt is from my mother; she is a hardworking woman and has been there for my siblings and I despite how we troubled her. My mother inspires me the most; she\u2019s my biggest supporter and she\u2019s my everything.\n\nYou did a butt job; what advice do you have for young women who also want to have cosmetic surgery?\n\nWell, do what makes you happy. Do what you want to do; it\u2019s your body, you call the shot and it is your money \u2014 spend it how you like to. Do whatever makes you happy.\n\nDescribe your style in two words?\n\nMy style in two words will be glam and fun.\n\nWhat do you look forward to? I look forward to greatness, opportunities, more growth, and everything good because I deserve everything good. I also look forward to good health, more business opportunities, open doors and all the good things of life.",

          "title": "Moet and Nicole: Spilling The Tea",
          "text": "With the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of digital media such as podcasts has only continued to increase. Jumping on the train of making it a part of their life and most importantly, giving listeners an opportunity to learn from different life issues, celebrity radio presenter and actress, Moet Abebe, and multimedia journalist Nicole Abebe are poised to giving the audience visual elements of a Talk Show, as well as the possibility of enjoying a show on a podcast format with the launch of in producart format ; \u2018Spill the Tea With the Abebes.\u2019\n\nThe show seeks to \u2018address topics that affect young people, but often shy away from. For the Abebes, talking about these topics such as rape, human trafficking, sexual assault, and gender violence amongsts others need to be discussed because talking about, them they believe is the beginning of making certain individual corrections and ultimately correcting the ills prevalent in our society today. They tell us more.\n\nMOET ABEBE: Being an only child helped shape me Between you and Nicole, whose idea was Spill the Tea and what inspired it?\n\nIt was a joint effort as well as that of the new Director and Producer, Sefinah Lamii. We all were casually having a \u201cgirl\u2019s night, in\u201d and we all realized how well Nicole and I work together, our chemistry and banter are effortless. So, it just came about naturally that we should work together.\n\nWho is your target audience and why?\n\nOur target audiences are millennials both here in Africa and in the Diaspora. That is, men and mostly, women between the age of 25 and 45.\n\nWhat should your viewers expect from your podcasts?\n\nThey should expect a show that entertains, enlightens, and educates. Viewers should be expecting to see different perspectives, opinions and views about these said topics. This would leave them no choice but to want to do their own bit, to change some of these backdated social narratives.\n\nAre you planning on bringing guests and what would you look out for in your guests?\n\nYes, we are planning on having guests on the show. The guests on the show have been handpicked specifically in relation to the topics. Every guest present on this season is able to add their own perspective ,by bringing in their personal experiences, and using them as examples. The viewer will easily be able to relate to these guests because they are all celebrities and social contributors who are doing very well in their various fields. The guests give out their own advice and also gain a thing or two from myself and Nicole\u2019s contributions and vice versa.\n\nTell us a bit about yourself, growing up years and events that shaped you into who you are today?\n\nI spent most of my developing years here in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. I did my nursery and primary education in Lagos, then secondary and University was in the UK. I feel the constant back and forth between these two countries really shaped me into becoming the open-minded and non judgmental person that I am today. I have always had to deal with the two cultures and to create a balance. As an only child, this has really helped to shape me into becoming an independent and hardworking woman.\n\nYou read Law but have been in the media for some time now; tell us what informed the switch?\n\nYes, I have. I honestly didn\u2019t want a monotonous life. I felt I could contribute more and what better way than delve into the media industry where my voice can be heard and creatively expressed.\n\nWhat do you find fascinating about being a radio personality?\n\nI love the fact that my voice and input can touch someone many miles away. The fact that people know the voice and can spot it anywhere is exciting. The fact that just being myself and speaking on my interests or things that affect me, equally affect the listener is such an exhilarating and powerful feeling. I absolutely love it.\n\nWhat or who inspires you in life and why?\n\nIn all honesty, I inspire myself. I am such a survivor and fighter. I keep pushing myself. I believe I can do more and guess what, I keep proving myself that I can achieve anything I put my mind to\n\nDo you intend to practice law in future?\n\nNo, I do not intend to practice.\n\nShare an example of when you established and accomplished a goal that was personally challenging. What helped you succeed?\n\nBeing the Executive Producer of this show has been the most challenging thing I have done. Having to do everything practically on my own, especially the funding of the show. From its inception to now, the accomplished product has not been an easy road. However, what I believe helped me succeed definitely has been God, and having the best production team to support me and bring my ideas to life.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI try to, at least, stay active as much as I can. I am also very particular about what I take into my body and at what time.\n\nHow do you balance your work and private life?\n\nI\u2019m able to balance the two, by not allowing factors from either, cross into the other. I just try my best not to mix the two. The parties present in my work life are not in my private life and vice versa.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u201cme\u201d time?\n\nThere are two things I love aside from being in front of the camera and a microphone. They are going to the spa and going to the beach. Those are the ways I really get to relax and spend \u201cme\u201d time.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nIt would have to be Seychelles.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nNothing is permanent, not even being alive. So just live your life to the fullest, and love with a pure and good heart.\n\nNICHOLE ABEBE: Our visual podcasts provide fresh and fun new content\n\nHow did you and Moet get together on this job, what is your relationship like?\n\nWhere do I begin with my big cousin Moet? In my first year of university, we had to gain some work experience in the media industry, and luckily for me, I was coming home to Nigeria for the summer. It is where I first met Moet, and I am glad I met her. Moet has become one of my favourite people in this world. She\u2019s beyond caring, as real as real can be, and I know hands down she\u2019s got my back. I love to annoy her at times (which you will see in the podcast) but it\u2019s really all love. I\u2019m super grateful to have her in my life. We always joke about working together one day, but now that it\u2019s a reality, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it with anyone else.\n\nOf what benefit do you think the podcast will be to your viewers?\n\nI believe our visual podcasts will provide viewers with fresh and fun new content. When Moet and I set out to create \u2018Spill The Tea\u2019, we wanted something people could get lost in. From the visually appealing set design, to the fun and colourful outfits we wear, down to the intriguing conversations we have. Every aspect of Spill The Tea With The Abebes was intentional. We only got better as the season went on.\n\nHow do you hope to come up with fresh interview ideas?\n\nThe fact that we wake up every morning, with breath in our lungs, and God\u2019s grace to be granted the gift of sight, we will always have new content. Things happen every day, not just to us, but to the viewers watching. As human beings, we have so much in common that we don\u2019t even realise. We all go through similar emotions and experiences at different stages in our lives. As long as our content is relatable, I don\u2019t think we have a problem there.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you?\n\nI was born in London before I moved back to Lagos when I was three months old. I attended Corona Primary School in Victoria Island up until primary three. At this point, my family moved back to London where I finished up my primary school education at Lady Banks Junior School. When I was 11 years old, I attended Burford School, a boarding school in Oxfordshire.\n\nI spent my formidable years there. I often say this is where I spent some of my best school years. I left Burford when I was 16 and attended The Chelsea Independent College in London for my A-Levels. I gained my undergrad degree from the University of Bedfordshire in Broadcast Journalism, before attending The New York Film Academy in New York City for my masters in Broadcasting. I have great memories when I think back to my school days, a lot of cringe memories too\u2026but I\u2019m trying to forget those.\n\nWhat informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nSo, growing up, I loved Hollywood for all the amazing movies they produced. I used to say to myself, \u201cwell I know I can\u2019t act, so how can I be a part of Hollywood without being in the movies?\u201d That was when my attention moved to Ryan Seacrest, the American television presenter, producer. I became obsessed with his job and how he did it so well. I looked into his education and that was when I started visualising a path for myself. I thought to myself that if I could gain the same skills he has, what would stop me from getting on E? I actually wrote my University application letter about him and got accepted to all my choices: So it worked. Here I am today. Thanks to Ryan.\n\nWho is your biggest role model?\n\nMy mother! She is the strongest, most helpful, caring, supportive, hard-working individual I have ever come across. I thank God every day that he made her my mother. I wouldn\u2019t be the young woman I am today if not for the discipline she instilled in me at a young age. She is the last person I ever want to disappoint. I\u2019m working so hard so that one day, my brothers and I can tell her to sit back and relax.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI\u2019m striving every day to become a full-time member of a Fitness club but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve learned to reduce my portion sizes. My choice of exercise is swimming. I love the fact that it works your whole body, plus, I find being in a huge body of water extremely calming and relaxing.\n\nWhat puts you off in people?\n\nI hate bad attitudes for no reason. If someone else upsets you, don\u2019t put that negative energy on me, it\u2019s not my fault. So when you first meet someone, show them the good sides of you. My mum always used to tell me, \u201calways look your best and act your best, people never forget the first impression\u201d.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I like to catch up on my favourite TV shows. I\u2019ve also gotten into exploring TV shows from other countries. I also find time to self-care. I give myself a facial every Sunday night and that makes me feel great when I wake up on Monday morning.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nMy best holiday destination is anywhere that gives me a tropical vibe. On my bucket list, I\u2019d like to visit places like Thailand, Bali, Greece, more destinations in the Caribbean and of course, The Maldives \u2013 but I\u2019ll save that one for my honeymoon.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nOver the years, life has taught me to look out for number one. I used to be a people pleaser and would get really upset when people weren\u2019t giving me the same energy I give them. It was a rude awakening when I realised most people don\u2019t care how they make you feel.",

Ibrahim Ali, for what it described as his \u201clackadaisical action and unprofessional services\u201d resulting in the lost of lives and property within his area of responsibility.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that a similar call was earlier made by the ECWA/TEKAN bloc of the Christian Association of Nigeria accusing the GOC of not responding to the aforementioned attacks, and calling for his removal for the loss of lives and properties.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the Nigerian Army had through Maj.

Ibrahim Ali, the General Officer Commanding, 3 Division in Rukuba, was plotting an evil mission in Plateau.\n\nLazarus had said, \u201cAli is on a mission to weed out criminals on the Plateau and not on a mission to support any tribe or religion\u201d.\n\nThe Coalition also called for the immediate arrest of Sheik Dahiru Bauchi and Alkali Abubakar Salisu Zaria for the inciting videos they shared, describing it as, \u201cthreatening Plateau State where the outcome of his threat and inciting utterances on social media manifested through the killings of Yelwa Zangam in Jos North LGA.\n\nThe group also alleged that the Presidency is enlisting repentant terrorists into the country\u2019s military, saying \u201cWe say no to Mr. President\u2019s plan and policy of integrating terrorists into our military structures and the society at large in the name of pardon for \u2018repentant\u2019 Boko Haram members.\u201d\n\nAdding that, \u201cThey must be prosecuted like any other criminals in Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Chairman of the Coalition, Comrade Lohnan Samson, while reacting on the recent killings in Miango, Riyom, Mangu, Rukuba road, Yelwa Zangam in Jos North and reprisals in other parts of the State.\n\nSamson said, \u201cWhile we commiserate with those who lost their loved ones in this heinous attacks, we call on the government at state and federal levels to arrest without further delay all those involved in those dastardly acts without emotions of religious sentiment for the life lost in Miango, Yelwa Zangam is equal to life lost in Rukuba road and elsewhere within the state.\n\nAdding that, \u201cDoing this will convince Nigerians that the government is not running a hidden agenda with selective justice.\n\n\u201cAt the back-drop of this abuse of professionalism by government security agencies, we see compromise and deliberate conspiracy against the peace loving people of Plateau State.\n\n\u201cWe demand that all innocent youths/people arrested in alleged to Rukuba road 22 killings by suspected criminals be released without prejudice to the immediate arrest of the suspected Fulani Bandits/unknown gunmen that killed over 70 in Miango nation, Yelwa Zangam recent attack and in other places mentioned earlier.\n\n\u201cWe demand for the removal of the 3 Division GOC who doubles as the STF Commander for his lackadaisical action and unprofessional services resulting in the lost of lives and property within his area of responsibility.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, how can one explain that an attack that lasted for over 5 hours at Miango yet the GOC who doubles as the STF commander says the area of responsibility under his command was too wide and large for him to be everywhere?\n\n\u201cThe headquarters of 3 armoured division is a stone throw from Miango Irigwe land, and the Commissioner of Police Plateau State Command also pretended as if nothing is happening in Miango killings not until the Rukuba road killings where he sharply responded in press statement through his PPRO to accuse Irigwe people of being behind the killing. Is that fair?\n\nSpeaking on inciting videos, the Coalition said, \u201cWe demand the immediate arrest of Sheik Dahiru Bauchi for threatening Plateau State where the outcome of his threat and inciting utterances on social media manifested through the killings of Yelwa Zangam in Jos North.\n\n\u201cWe also demand for the immediate arrest of one Alkali Abubakar Salisu Zaria who claimed to be a holy Islamic scholar and teacher that produced a video cursing Plateau people as Arnis(infidels), an inflammatory language capable of causing religious war across Plateau State and the country at large\u201d, the group warned.\n\n\u201cWe demand that Government of Plateau State resist giving any compensation to selective victims of crises and if the government chooses to obey the voice of any threat elsewhere, then the compensation should be dated to 2001 because no life is more important than others\u201d, the Coalition explained.\n\nOn the issue of grazing route, the Coalition said, \u201cWe say a big NO for any grazing route in Plateau State except the ranching programme, while we call on the Plateau State House of the Assembly to immediately pass the bill sent by the Executive Governor of Plateau State to the State House to stop open grazing.\n\n\u201cWe say no to Mr. President plan and policy of integrating terrorists into our military structures and the society at large in the name of pardon for \u2018repentant\u2019 Boko Haram members. They must be prosecuted like any other criminals in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe wish to warn that nothing should happen to the Plateau State Governor Rt. Hon. Simon Bako Lalong as the security agencies have shown total disregard to his directives to act fast and arrest criminals. We take this action as a grand plan to sabotage his Government and throw Plateau State back into the dark days\u201d, the Coalition warned.",

          "text": "Plan to take off with civil servants\n\nPFN cautions\n\nVaccination against COVID-19 will soon become compulsory, the Federal Government said on Thursday.\n\nPresently, vaccination is voluntary.\n\nGovernment workers will be first to be mandated to take the jab, when the planned policy begins, Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha said.\n\nHe spoke in Abuja at a conference by the Health Commission.\n\nHowever, the government will ensure mass availability of vaccine before implementation of the plan.\n\nAlready, the government has made vaccination compulsory for Nigerians going on pilgrimage in Saudi Arabi and Israel.\n\nOndo State government took the first step towards compulsory vaccination when on Monday its State Executive Council (SEC) approved a proposal for compulsory vaccination of residents.\n\nThe same step taken by Edo State government was halted by a court injunction.\n\nMustapha, who is Head of the Federal Government agency battling COVID-19, said: \u201cThe vaccine mandate obviously will come. Before now, the simple yellow fever vaccine, you could not travel the world without the card until Nigeria was exited from the list of endemic countries. Therefore, the world is gravitating towards that direction. I can tell you that by the time the western world vaccinates its people, you can\u2019t get into any of the Western countries without the vaccine certificate; it has started happening in the European Union dispensation now. They have created some waivers for people that have been vaccinated. It is better we begin to prepare people at home.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we want to do that with federal civil servants is because they will be travelling to perform roles on behalf of the Federal Government. The United Nations General Assembly will be starting very soon and we will need our people to go there. Assuming the American Government says that you can\u2019t come into the U.S. unless you are vaccinated, and we have not provided vaccinations for our people, how will they go and prepare grounds for the meetings that will be attended by the President and other top government officials?\n\n\u201cIt is a sequential thing and we are taking one step at a time. We realised we do not have sufficient vaccine. So, we will not be able to impose those kinds of mandates on an automatic basis; it has to take some time and we will make sure that the vaccines are available and are deployed in the appropriate places and people will have the opportunity of getting the vaccines before we impose the mandatory nature of whether you have vaccines or not before you can access government facilities.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe biggest haul of vaccine the country is expecting is the 29 million doses of American-made Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine.\n\nThe single dose jab is expected to be delivered before the end of this month. The government has already paid for it.\n\nBefore now, the country has been administering doses of AstraZeneca and recently the Moderna vaccines \u2013 all donations.\n\n\u201cI will continue to appeal to the doctors that in the midst of a pandemic, any form of strike is unnecessary because already people are dealing with something that is beyond your control. The COVID-19 pandemic is a thing that is beyond anybody\u2019s control, and it is not even in the hands of the government. Therefore, we can resolve these issues and we can make every effort to ensure that these strikes are totally avoidable,\u201d Mustapha added.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of all the Commissioners of Health, the Chairman of the Forum of Health Commissioners, Dr. Betta Edu, said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s health sector needs a revolution and something drastic has to happen. If you do not cash in on the window of opportunity of this pandemic, we will all be in a terrible situation thereafter. That is why all the commissioners of health in Nigeria have gathered here today to bring up policies, positions, network and come up with a communique that will state our position on how Nigeria can achieve universal health coverage, improve preventive care at state level, get more support to the states, especially as it concerns the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) President, Bishop Francis Wale Oke described as illogical, the alleged move by the Federal Government to punish Nigerians, who refuse to be vaccinated.\n\nRev. Oke, who is also the presiding Bishop of The Sword of the Spirit Ministries, Ibadan, spoke at the on-going 39th Annual Holy Ghost Convention of his ministry.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne doubts if Nigeria can yet boast of having 10 million vaccines available for a country with over 200 million population.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government makes available about 250 million vaccines and Nigerians who are yet to be vaccinated refused the COVID-19 vaccines, then the government can be justified in its action.\u201d",

          "text": "Federal Government directive to the Debt Management Office (DMO) to issue promissory notes to governments\u2019 contractors and consultants is in bad faith, governors said on Thursday.\n\nThe chief executive officers under the auspices of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) asked Finance, Budget and National Planning Minister Hajia Zainab Ahmed to withdraw the order pending the determination of processes they filed in a court.\n\nThe NGF made the request through a letter by their counsel, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN).\n\nThe letter, dated August 30, was titled: \u201cRe: Liquidation of judgment debts on behalf of federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), states and local government councils; authorisation to issue promissory notes in favour of judgment creditors; and protest against your attempt to foist a fait accompli on the court.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cWe are amazed to note that despite the service of these processes as well as hearing notice on your office, your permanent secretary acting under your instruction, directed the Debt Management office (DMO) to issue promissory notes to contractors and consultants, whose claims are still being challenged and contested in court.\n\nRead Also: Governors demand 42 percent revenue allocation\n\n\u201cAs you already know, these promissory notes your office is directing the DMO to issue to these contractors and consultants are to be deducted over a period of 10 years from statutory allocations due to the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cWe therefore find it not only curious, but an action in bad taste for your office to issue a directive through your Permanent Secretary to the DMO to issue promissory notes to contractors and consultants whose claims are being contested by the tiers of government, who would ultimately bear the brunt of repaying these debts.\u201d\n\nThe governors questioned the minister\u2019s \u201cinterest in having contractors and consultants paid with issuance of promissory notes when the various judgments of courts of first instance are being challenged and contested on appeal by the tiers of government, whose statutory allocations would be deducted to defray these bogus amounts of money your office is illegally authorising their payments.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cWe hold the strong view that this in itself is the height of corruption and lawlessness. If one may ask, what is the special interest of the Ministry of Finance in directing expeditious payment of disputed claims to individual contractors and consultants in the face of valid court processes challenging the decisions of courts of first instance upon which these claims are based?\u201d\n\nThey also drew the minister\u2019s attention to their earlier letter challenging the decisions of the court relating to, or connected with payments of legal and consultancy fees arising from London Club Debt Buy-Back and London Club Debt Exit Payment, which form the fulcrum of the judgment of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe verdict was on a suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/130/13 \u2013 LINAS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED & ORS V. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA & ORS.\n\nAccording to the governors, the minister\u2019s office was duly served with the court processes seeking for stay of execution of, and/or injunction restraining the office and others from further enforcing the judgment.\n\nThe letter further states: \u201cWe need to inform you of your sacred duty of staying action on this matter in view of the injunctive reliefs sought in the processes duly filed in court on these matters.\n\n\u201cIt is the law that once an application for injunctive reliefs (such as the one filed by us and already fixed for hearing) is pending in a court of law, parties are barred from engaging in any act that would foist a fiat accompli on the Court in respect of that application, or action.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe kindly refer you to the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the famous case of The Military Governor of Lagos State & Ors v. Chief Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu & Anor (1986) 1 NWLR (Pt. 18) 621 @ 636 where it was held that :\n\n\u201cOnce a dispute has arisen between a person and the government or authority and the dispute has been brought before the court, thereby invoking the judicial powers of the state, it is the duty of the government to allow the law to take its full course for the legal and judicial process to run its full course.\u201d",

Reliefs 5, 6 and 7 are injunctive reliefs being sought in the interim\u2026\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cReliefs 1, 2, 3, 4 and alternative prayer 5 of the motion ex-parte are hereby granted. Alternative Prayer 5 is granted only in relation to the 15th defendant\u2026\u201d\n\nThe alternative prayer five is for the court to restrain the second to 14th defendants/respondents from further acting or parading themselves as CECPC members.\n\nThe 15th defendant in the suit is Jones Ode Erue, who was sued in his capacity as caretaker chairman of the APC in Delta.\n\nHe was not captured in the plaintiffs/applicants reliefs, which covered the second to 14th defendants.\n\nThe implication of the order is that Erue cannot conduct the congresses because he was restrained, but Buni can because the injunction, \u201cwhich shall abate after seven days\u201d, does not apply to him.\n\nThe CECPC yesterday warned members against taking the party to court or risk sanction.\n\nThe warning followed a legal action taken by some aggrieved members in the Delta State chapter.\n\nOn Thursday, the party expelled its caretaker chairman in Yola South Local Government, Alhaji Sulaiman Adamu for making uncomplimentary remarks about President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBuni, who inaugurated the Local Government Congress Committees for tomorrow\u2019s exercise said the Caretaker Committee was determined to carry out the directive of the December 5 National Executive Committee (NEC), which forbids members from taking the party to court.\n\nRepresented by CECPC Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, the he declared that the Local Government Congresses and the July 31 nationwide Ward Congresses were \u201clegally protected.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman urged committee members to go to their states of primary assignment with confidence, dignity, commitment, and pride.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe also use this opportunity to reiterate the resolution of NEC of our party to severely sanction members and their sponsors who take the party to court. His Excellency (Hon) Mai Mala Buni is determined to carry out to the letter the instructions of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, which is to rebuild the party, button-up. The process has reached an advanced ground stage.\n\n\u201cRest assured that your assignment, as well as the earlier Ward Congresses nationwide, is legally protected. We are on solid ground.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the CECPC ratifies and adopts the results of the party\u2019s earlier nationwide Ward Congresses held on Saturday, July 31st, 2021, however, any State Caretaker Committee who swears in any person or group of persons who are not elected through a congress conducted by the designated National Congress Committee of the Party is null, void and of no effect. However, where there are still complaints, the CECPC would be fair to all.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the CECPC hereby directs you all to go and conduct nationwide Local Government (LGA) Congresses on Saturday, September 4, 2021, as contained in the official timetable/schedule of activities released by the party.\u201d\n\nThe Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, who spoke on behalf of the LG Congress Committees promised to conduct the exercise in line with the Constitution of the party and the vision of the founding fathers of the party.\n\nYesterday, the National Caretaker Committee ratified Adamu\u2019s expulsion from the party at its meeting in Abuja.\n\nA statement by Akpanudoedehe said that the expulsion takes immediate effect.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CECPC received and deliberated on the report of his (Adamu) infractions and recommendations of the 7-member disciplinary committee set up by the Adamawa State Working Committee to investigate the offenses committed by Alhaji Sulaiman Adamu against the interest of the party.\n\n\u201cRecall the viral video in which Alhaji Sulaiman Adamu made unwholesome utterances on President Muhammadu Buhari, the Leader of the Party.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said Adamu was also found guilty of bringing the image of the party to disrepute thereby creating doubt on his leadership quality and loyalty to the party.\n\n\u201cThe CECPC calls on party members to always demonstrate self-discipline and restraint by desisting from acts and utterances that are inimical to the interest of the party.\u201d",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, received the forensic audit report of the Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC) with a vow to prosecute those who mismanaged about N6trillion allocated to the commission for projects.\n\nPresident Buhari specifically queried the operation of 362 accounts by the commission without proper reconciliation. He said between 2001 and 2019, the Federal Government, approved and released the total sum of N7trillion to the NDDC as income from statutory and non statutory sources.\n\nHe said the the Federal Government was particularly concerned with the colossal loss occasioned by uncompleted and unverified development projects in the Niger Delta Region, in spite of the huge resources made available to it to uplift the living standard of the citizens of the region.\n\nHe also expressed concerns with multitudes of NDDC\u2019s bank accounts amounting to 362 and lack of proper reconciliation of accounts.\n\nBuhari, represented at the presentation ceremony by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), directed that the forensic audit report be forwarded to the Federal Ministry of Justice for legal review and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to do justice to the findings.\n\n\u201cWe have on record over 13,777 projects, the execution of which is substantially compromised. The Federal Government will in consequence apply the law to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the audit report as appropriate. This will include, but not limited to, initiation of criminal investigations, prosecution, recovery of funds not properly utilised for the public purposes for which they were meant for review of the laws to reposition and restructure the NDDC for the efficiency of better service delivery amongst others. In all these instances of actions, legal due processes will strictly be complied with.\u201d\n\nMinister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, who submitted the report, said though the exercise had a checkered history, the President and all those who supported and ensured its success should be commended.\n\nHe said the audit was not done to witch-hunt anyone, but to ensure that huge sums of funds committed to the development of the region through the NDDC yearly were judiciously used.\n\nHe said the report of the audit committee showed that their were over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta, adding that even before the submission of the report, some contractors returned to site on their own and completed about 77 road projects.\n\nHe lamented that the region had remained backwards since 1958 in spite of successive governments efforts through the creation of various interventionist programmes and projects.\n\nLead Forensic Auditor, Alhaji Kabir Ahmed, in a brief overview of the report, said the team recommended managerial and structural changes, chief of which is the downsizing of NDDC board, with members appointed on part time basis.\n\nThe appointment of members of the board of the NDDC had been suspended until the release of the audit report. Ahmed also disclosed that oil companies in the country were still in default of their contributions to the commission.\n\nIt recommended that the government withdraw the licence of any oil company which defaults for a period of three years. It also recommended the deduction of 15 per cent ecological fund at source and paid to the commission as both the federal and state governments have failed to make payments to the commission. The team recommended as a measure of effective revenue collections, that the Federal Inland Revenue Services collects fund on behalf of NDDC from oil companies in the country.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The Kogi State Government gave no mandate or instruction to Sterling Bank Plc to open a fixed deposit account on its behalf as it could barely meet the salary obligations for which the funds were received at the material time.\n\n\u201cSterling Bank Plc by its letter of 1st September 2021 confirmed in writing that the \u2018the Kogi State Government does not currently operate or maintain a fixed deposit account with Sterling Bank\u2019. Here is a copy of that letter.\n\n\u201cThe letter proceeded to confirm that all the balances in all the accounts operated by Kogi State Government was approximately N46 Million Naira.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nTransition Monitoring Group (TMG) said Nigerians are losing confidence in the electoral system because of malpractice, manipulation, violence, commercialisation and privatisation of political parties and offices for self-centred interests.\n\nThis is as it accused the Federal Government and military of treating the issue of national security with levity while all geopolitical zones continue to bleed in a manner that portends grave danger to the nation\u2019s hard-earned democracy.\n\nChairman of Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, stated this, yesterday, at press conference on the state of the electoral process in Nigeria and the unveiling of group\u2019s agenda for the next four years.\n\nHe said the board and TMG members would do their best to advocate electoral transparency and accountability by mobilising Nigerians to demand positive change in the electoral process.\n\nOn the state of the nation, he said TMG is compelled to react to several unsavoury developments in the polity and condemned the recent attack on the Nigeria Defence Academy.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe expect that government would nip the security issue in the bud and toe an acceptable and less divisive path of bringing a lasting end to the security challenges that presently bedevilling the country.\n\n\u201cWe, however, note with concern that the Federal Government and military have been treating the issue of our national security with levity while all geopolitical zones continue to bleed in a manner that portends grave danger to our hard-earned democracy.\n\n\u201cThe electoral processes have had their share of violence with the secessionist movement calling for a boycott of the election with threats to disrupt the poll, thugs razing down electoral management offices, killing of security personnel, burning of police stations and kidnapping of election officials.\n\n\u201cThere is a pervasive atmosphere of uncertainty as to when the government will address the cases of banditry and kidnapping that have engulfed the country.\n\n\u201cTMG calls on the government to urgently address our multifaceted security challenges before the conduct of the 2023 election to prevent voter apathy that may arise due to the inability of voters to travel to exercise their civic rights, the safety of electoral materials and election officials and the credibility of election results.\n\n\u201cCorruption in Nigeria\u2019s electoral processes is showing no signs of leaving soon as politicians continue to flaunt unaccounted campaign spendings and party financing by using illegitimate funds as the sole means of winning voters over.\n\n\u201cIndependent National Electoral Commission and other relevant agencies need to tackle the menace to allow voters to form a more objective opinion of the people they are to vote for.\n\n\u201cSince 1999, credible local government elections in Nigeria have been illusory, the processes and outcome of the council elections have remained the will of the state and ruling party rather than reflecting the consent and aspirations of the people as the electorate.\n\n\u201cThe political interference from the state government and partisanship of the state independent electoral commission has led to a lack of trust in local elections and the increasing cases of voters\u2019 apathy with inconsistency in the application of electoral guidelines and poor communication channels between state electoral commissions and electoral stakeholders.\n\n\u201cTMG sees this as rape of local governance that portends grave danger for participatory democracy, accountability and rural development. We call on the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, political parties and relevant stakeholders to join voices in ensuring that credible council elections are prioritised and conducted as at when due and reforms should be put in place for local institutional strengthening and framework for local government development.\n\n\u201cIt is also of great concern that the autonomy of states judiciaries and Houses of Assembly are yet to take effect. This has continued to fuel disregard for the rule of law and court orders. Without the autonomy, separation of powers and checks and balances in Nigeria will remain only on paper as the executive continues to technically wield the powers of the other two arms of government.\u201d\n\nRafsanjani also urged the media to \u201ctake a deep study of the political environment, take a continuing interest in the political affairs of this great country, understand and suggest areas you feel are in need of further engagements by the TMG so that we can all move into the field to succeed.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

He hinted that more ministers would be shown the way out in an urgent need to reinvigorate his cabinet.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who read the president\u2019s statement to newsmen after the FEC meeting, quoted Buhari as saying that the cabinet rearrangement was part of measures to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy, and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians\n\nAdesina also revealed that the president would fill the two vacant ministerial positions soon after confirmation of substantive nominees to be sent to the Senate in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement read, \u201cOn Wednesday 21 August 2019 the current FEC was sworn-in after a rigorous retreat to bring returning and new members up to speed on the accomplishments, challenges and lessons drawn from my first term in office and to emphasise the nine priority areas of government for the second term.\n\n\u201cTwo years and some months into the second term, the tradition of subjecting our projects and programmes implementation to independent and critical self-review has taken firm roots through sector reporting during cabinet meetings and at retreats.\n\n\u201cThese significant review steps have helped to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cI must commend this cabinet for demonstrating unparalleled resilience that helped the government to navigate the disruption to global systems and governance occasioned by the emergence of COVID-19 shortly after inauguration. The weekly FEC meetings were not spared because the traditional mode was altered.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, change is the only factor that is constant in every human endeavour and as this administration approaches its critical phase in the second term, I have found it essential to reinvigorate this cabinet in a manner that will deepen its capacity to consolidate legacy achievements.\u201d\n\nThe president pointed out that he had personally met with the sacked ministers to thank them for their contributions to discussions in cabinet as well as the invaluable services they rendered to the nation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cToday, effectively marks their last participation in the FEC deliberations and I wish them the best in all future endeavours.\n\n\u201cFinally, I wish to reiterate once more, that this process shall be continuous.\u201d\n\nHowever, reacting to the president\u2019s decision to sack the two ministers, some operators in the power and agriculture sectors said both men added no value to the respective sectors they were overseeing.\n\nNational Coordinator, All Nigerian Electricity Consumers Protection Forum, Mr. Adeola Samuel-Ilori, told THISDAY, with regard to Mamman\u2019s sack, that consumers were indifferent to his discharge because they never felt his impact throughout his time in the saddle.\n\nSamuel-Ilori said there was hardly anything that portrayed him as being in-charge of the power ministry. He alleged that Mamman was merely interested in protecting some interests in the sector.\n\nSamuel-Ilori alleged, \u201cThe consumers\u2019 feeling cannot be different, we are indifferent, and you know why, while the man held sway, there was no feeling of his presence in that office. There was nothing he did that showed that he was in charge of the ministry or that he was overseeing either TCN or NERC and every other person. So, I don\u2019t see any reason why the consumers should feel anything about his absence.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to how the man emerged, it would tell you that the man came for a purpose and I\u2019m sure that the purpose must have been fulfilled.\u201d\n\nAn operator, who pleaded to remain anonymous, also alleged that the sacked power minister never added value to the sector.\n\nThe operator said about Mamman, \u201cHe was just a stumbling block in the system. The president told him to set up a board for the Transmission Commission of Nigeria, but he was just foot-dragging. Also he wasn\u2019t willing to support Siemens and he kept foot-dragging as well.\n\n\u201cWe hold regular meetings with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on the power sector, where we always have top officials of the central bank, but he hardly attended.\n\n\u201cWe also met with the Minister of Finance and officials of the Debt Management Office, but he was hardly in attendance. All our challenges, he is not the one resolving them, it is either the CBN Governor or Minister of Finance.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, commenting on the sack of Nanono, an operator in the agriculture sector said he was never fit for the role. The source also preferred to remain anonymous.\n\nThe source also noted the recent stockpiling of some agricultural produce by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development under Nanono, which contributed to inflationary pressure in the country.\n\nNanono had awarded contracts to some organisations to mop up some commodities, including maize, sorghum and rice and the move led to increase in the price of maize and rice. The arrangement, which was termed, \u201cEmergency Procurement\u201d, had contradicted efforts by policymakers in the country to tame inflation.\n\nPDP Tackles Buhari on Ministers\u2019 Sack\n\nMeanwhile, PDP described the sack of ministers as an attempt to cover the president\u2019s failure in office.\n\nIn a statement by the PDP national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it was investigating the real reason behind the ministers\u2019 sack given the president\u2019s public approach to fighting corruption by \u201ceasing out\u201d the culprits.\n\nPDP asserted that the inefficiency of the Buhari administration was a product of his myopic and divisive approach to governance as well as the impunity and corruption deeply embedded in his government and party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nPDP said even if the best hands were recruited, they would be contaminated by \u201cincompetence, impunity, disregard for rules, divisiveness and corruption that have become the hallmark of the APC and its administration.\u201d\n\nThe party called on Buhari and APC to note that Nigerians were not swayed by the sack of the ministers but \u201care eagerly awaiting the exit of the Buhari presidency and the APC come May 29, 2023, as there is no hope in sight under their purview.\u201d\n\nOn its part, a civil rights advocacy group, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) urged Buhari to sack the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd); as well as the National Secretary Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd.).\n\nAccording to the group, the three ministers have failed in terms of containing the security challenges plaguing the nation.\n\nNational Coordinator of HURIWA, Emmanuel Onwubiko, disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja\n\nAccording to the HURIWA coordinator, \u201cThe Minister of Defence and the NSA to the President should be sacked. There is no doubt that students are constantly kidnapped and the security situation in Nigeria has become like a war situation and deteriorated almost to a point that the president is openly accused of undermining national security.\n\n\u201cThe NSA should have been sacked about two years ago\u2026\n\n\u201cThe country has never had it so bad in terms of security threats. Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna are all under the control of terrorists and even Nigerian Defence Academy was not spared of the disgraceful attacks by terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the justice minister justified the illegal rendition and abduction by government of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, (Nnamdi Kanu), from Nairobi, Kenya, means that the justice minister is grossly incompetent and unfit for that high office.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022As world health body launches disease intelligence preparedness initiative\n\n\u2022 Governor Uzodinma, Moghalu hail appointment\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nDirector General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, has been appointed Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in charge of Health Emergency Intelligence. The appointment takes effect from November 1, 2021.\n\nA statement by WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, yesterday, explained that Ihekweazu would lead the work on strengthening pandemic and epidemic intelligence globally, including heading the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin, which was launched yesterday.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State and a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Professor Kingsley Moghalu, lauded the appointment, calling it well-deserved.\n\nThe WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence is a global platform for creating shared and networked access to vital multi-sectoral data, driving innovations in data analytics, and building the communities of practice needed to predict, prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to worldwide health threats.\n\nIn addition, the WHO Hub is a new global collaboration of countries and partners dedicated to driving innovations to increase availability and linkage of diverse data; developing tools and predictive models for risk analysis; and monitoring disease control measures and infodemics.\n\nThe WHO Hub would enable partners from around the world to collaborate and co-create the tools and data access that all countries need to prepare, detect and respond to pandemic and epidemic risks.\n\nThe statement by the WHO director-general said, \u201cI am pleased to welcome Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu as an Assistant Director-General for Health Emergency Intelligence from November 1, 2021. He will lead the work on strengthening pandemic and epidemic intelligence globally, including heading the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin.\n\n\u201cI am confident that Dr. Ihekweazu\u2019s appointment will help further accelerate WHO\u2019s work in health emergencies.\n\n\u201cPlease, join me in welcoming him to WHO.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the need for the new global initiative, German Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel, was quoted as saying, \u201cThe current COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that we can only fight pandemics and epidemics together. The new WHO Hub will be a global platform for pandemic prevention, bringing together various governmental, academic and private sector institutions.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that WHO chose Berlin as its location and invite partners from all around the world to contribute to the WHO hub.\u201d\n\nThe German Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, said there was need to identify pandemic and epidemic risks as quickly as possible.\n\nSpahn stated, \u201cFor that aim, we need to strengthen the global early warning surveillance system with improved collection of health-related data and inter-disciplinary risk analysis.\n\n\u201cGermany has consistently been committed to support WHO\u2019s work in preparing for and responding to health emergencies, and the WHO Hub is a concrete initiative that will make the world safer.\u201d\n\nThe minister assured that the WHO Hub would work with partners globally to achieve a scale-up in innovation for existing forecasting and early warning capacities in WHO and member states.\n\nHe also said the WHO Hub would accelerate global collaborations across public and private sector organisations, academia, and international partner networks.\n\nAccording to Spahn the pandemic intelligence hub would help countries to collaborate and co-create the necessary tools for managing and analysing data for early warning surveillance.\n\nIhekweazu, while speaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, said the decision to appoint him to lead the global initiative was a recognition of the work the NCDC under his leadership.\n\nIhekweazu said, \u201cIt is in recognition of what we have done in Nigeria with the NCDC, the Federal Ministry of Health, and the Presidential Steering Committee in responding to this pandemic in Nigeria; in responding to many other infectious disease threats that have happened over the last few years \u2013 monkey pox, Lassa fever and the rest of them.\n\n\u201cAlso, it is in recognising that in order to have a global initiative to respond, there is need to have deep knowledge about how local systems work. So, I think it is a recognition that the work that we have done over the past five years to develop this system will have a big contribution in the global context.\u201d\n\nThe NCDC boss was trained as an infectious disease epidemiologist, and he has over 20 years experience working in senior public health and leadership positions in several National Public Health Institutes, including the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD); the United Kingdom\u2019s Health Protection Agency; and Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute (RKI).\n\nHe has led several short-term engagements for WHO, mainly in response to major infectious disease outbreaks around the world.\n\nIhekweazu, a Nigerian, was born in Germany. He is a graduate of the College of Medicine, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and holds a Master in Public Health (MPH) degree from the Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nIn 2003, he was awarded a Fellowship for the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) and, subsequently, completed his Public Health specialisation in the United Kingdom. He is widely published in medical peer-review journals.\n\nMeanwhile, Uzodimma lauded the appointment of Ihekweazu as WHO Assistant Director-General.\n\nThe governor said in a statement by his Special Adviser (SA) Media/Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachuku, he wasn\u2019t surprised over the appointment because Ihekweazu demonstrated capacity and exhibited professional competence as DG of NCDC.\n\n\u201cIhekweazu is one of Imo State\u2019s best and brightest and that the state is proud to be part of the human capital contributing towards the wellbeing of the global family,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nUzodimma reiterated that Ihekweazu\u2019s pick was fundamental because, \u201cit will help to further bring Imo State into global focus, particularly Amaigbo in Nwangele Local Government Area of the state where the NCDC DG hails from.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged Ihekweazu to continue to do the state proud, and assured him of the support of the government and good people of Imo State to ensure that his outing at the WHO is exemplary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They kill police officers and military personnel and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cWere this group in a western country, you would not expect to hear Amnesty\u2019s full-throated defence of their actions. Instead, there would be silence or mealy-mouthed justification of western governments\u2019 action to check the spread of \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite Amnesty\u2019s self-proclaimed mandate to impartially transcend borders, unfortunately in Nigeria they play only domestic politics. The international NGO is being used as cover for the organisation\u2019s local leaders to pursue their self-interests. Regrettably, this is not uncommon in Africa\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cAgain, they have decided to side with terrorists, before the liberty of those they injure, displace and murder.\n\n\u201cSpeaking the language of universal human rights, Amnesty International deploys it only in defence \u2013 even outright promotion \u2013 of those that violently oppose the Federal Government of Nigeria. Parroting the line of Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB, a proscribed terror organisation, they work to legitimise its cause to Western audiences.\n\n\u201cThis puts them in bad company. Controversial American lobbyists are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to do the same, laundering IPOB\u2019s reputation in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cIPOB murder Nigerian citizens. They kill police officers and military personnel and set government property on fire.

Regrettably, this is not uncommon in Africa.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with an activist stance; there are claims of neutrality, when all facts point to the opposite.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International has no legal right to exist in Nigeria. It must open a formal investigation into the personnel that occupy their Nigerian offices. They should reject the outrageously tendentious misinformation they receive and bring some semblance of due diligence to the sources they base their claims on. Currently, we see none.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government will fight terrorism with all the means at its disposal. We will ignore Amnesty\u2019s rantings.

          "title": "Fintech Focus: The link between Open Banking and financial inclusion",
          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How customer loyalty is helping Nigerian fintech apps through regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

This happened on Tuesday.\n\nThe committee gave Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) two weeks to reduce its 18 cargo clearing stages to four in order to decongest the ports.\n\nThis cargo clearing stage explains the long list of Customs units that importers and their agents are expected to pass through before their cargoes would be released.\n\nSadly, this results in delay that makes it difficult for Nigeria to meet the 48-hour cargo clearance target as cargo now dwells for a minimum of 21 days at ports, compelling importers to pay millions of naira as demurrage and storage charges to shipping companies and terminal operators.\n\nIn addition, Nigeria Customs has also failed to move away from 100 percent physical examination of containers to the use of electronic scanning machines that fact track cargo inspections in modern ports. This was due to the failure of the Federal Government to either acquire new scanners or refurbish the existing scanners at ports.\n\nPresently, Customs has over 13 different units at the port and they include Enforcement, Valuation, Customs Intelligent Units (CIU), Residence, Taskforce, Strike Force, CG Squad, Headquarters Strike Force, Customs Police, Special Weapons and Tactical Team (SWATT), Abuja Alert, Gate and the Federal Operations Units that mount checkpoints few meters from the port gate.\n\nCorruption at ports\n\nAccording to Leke Abejide (SDC-Kogi), chairman of House Committee on Customs, long units of Customs are avenues for illegal transactions by corrupt officers of the service, and it also hinders the free flow of activities at ports.\n\nThis is why, he insists, Customs needs to bring down these procedures to four stages to cut down on illegalities and ensure revenue goes to the government.\n\nLoss of transit cargoes\n\nBusinessDay understands that Customs poor attitude to trade facilitation has been the major reason why Nigeria has been losing cargoes and revenue to the ports in neighbouring countries.\n\nGbemi Saraki, Minister of State for Transport, says recently in Lagos that Nigerian ports cannot compete due to inefficiency caused by manual clearing processes.\n\nTo her, this has resulted in the loss of transit cargoes that were supposed to move to landlocked countries such as Niger through Nigerian ports, to the Benin Republic and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nFor instance, while the Benin Republic and Cote d\u2019Ivoire are using scanners, Nigeria Customs still opens containers and carry out 100 percent examination of cargoes.\n\nRead also: Customs intercepts contraband with over N643m Duty Paid Value in Lagos\n\nDelay in cargo clearance\n\nMultiple units of Customs create cargo clearing delays at ports. As Customs delay in clearing goods, cargoes dwell longer at the port. In some instances, containers that are supposed to take seven days to be cleared now takes a minimum of 21 days to be cleared out of the port.\n\nThis is why Mohammed Bello-Koko, acting managing director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), says that Customs had multiple units within the same port that makes the process of cargo clearing very cumbersome.\n\nHigh cost of doing business at ports\n\nIt has been proven that multiple Customs units create delays in cargo clearance at ports. This delay comes with economic implications on businesses as manufacturers and other importers that do business at ports are forced to pay demurrage to shipping companies and rent to terminal operators.\n\nConfirming this, Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment Ltd, says Customs is still creating more units in Lagos Ports, and their operations inflict pain on importers as well as their agents.\n\nWith this, he says, importers incur avoidable expenses that only result in losses at the end of the day, which they automatically transfer to consumers through high prices of goods.\n\n\u201cThere is more division in Customs today. The Service is creating more units where documents for cargo clearing must pass through before goods would be released, and these units are fueling corruption through extortion of money from importers. The existence of these units causes a delay that results in payment of demurrage and storage charges to shipping companies and terminal operators,\u201d he explains.\n\nPort congestion\n\nTerminals within Lagos ports are experiencing high yard occupancy, showing there is congestion and longer dwell time for imported cargo. This also affects the waiting time of vessels as ships now spend longer days on Nigerian waters before being able to enter the port to berth.\n\nThis high rate of congestion can be attributed to the longer dwell time of cargoes caused by delays in cargo clearance as well as Customs cumbersome clearing procedures.\n\nThis is why Jonathan Nicol, president of the Shippers Association of Lagos State, says there is a need to improve cargo clearing methods by removing clearing bottlenecks to decongest the ports.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nRights group, Ebonyi Advocacy for Human Rights Initiative, has accused David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State, of plotting to disposes landlords in the state of their landed properties through what it called an illegal and lawless process of nullifying all Certificates of Occupancy( C of O) in the state.\n\nThe group which raised the alarm in a statement by its chairman, Chief Abia Onyike, gave the governor two weeks ultimatum to reverse the \u201cillegal Executive Order,\u201d or it shall deploy all legitimate and legal instruments to force him to do so.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe latest intriguing, subterranean, dictatorial and totalitarian steps of Gov. David Umahi, aimed to disposes Ebonyi landlords of their hard earned landed properties. He is about to commit a terrible crime unless he is called to order. He is working towards the total and complete confiscation of all landed properties in the state through an illegal and lawless process of nullifying all Certificates of Occupancy( C of O) in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Governor issued a Public Service Announcement, dated Thursday, September 2, 2021, through his Special Assistant on Lands and Survey, Emmanuel Igwe, where he stated that, \u2018all Certificates of Occupancy are hereby withdrawn,\u2019 calling on residents and landlords to go for re-certitication.\n\n\u201cWe condemn Gov. Umahi\u2019s lawless effrontery in this regard because we see his Executive Order as an abuse of his constitutional powers. It is an excessive and arrogant display of power and a viscious affront on the good people of Ebonyi state who elected him into office.\n\n\u201cThe illegal exercise he wants to embark upon is a ploy to create confusion and to possibly shield himself away from his nefarious activities as an emergent land grabber who has a lot of questions to answer about the seizure of plots in the Meat Market, Old Building Materials Market and other layouts where land was recovered by the State Government. Secondly, the Governor is looking for an opportunity to victimize his political opponents, critics of his evil Government and some non-indigeneous property owners whom he has earmarked to seize their properties.\n\n\u201cWe shall deploy all legitimate and legal instruments to force Gov. Umahi to rescind his illegal Executive Order. We give him two weeks to stand down the order or we shall drag him to Court. It is our considered opinion that a responsible Government cannot suddenly wake up to nullify the entire C of Os in the state. If there is an overriding public interest to warrant the withdrawal of any C of O, then the government should clearly and objectively state the reasons. The Governor has no power to unilaterally nullify all C of Os based on his personal whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cWe equally condemn Gov. Umahi\u2019s controversial handling of the #6 billion allocated to Ebonyi State in respect of the cattle ranch which Gov. Umahi was alleged to have planned to site in Nwofe area in Izzi LGA. The Governor went about these transactions very discreetly. But when the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu opened up on the matter and revealed that Ebonyi state had collected #6b for the project, Umahi was jolted and went into cock and bull stories bordering on denials. But the problem with Umahi is that he has no integrity to make people believe him. He has desecrated his high office. He is a perpetual liar.\n\n\u201cSince the whole issue of Fulani Herdsmen started with the attendant matters bordering on RUGA, South East Regional Security and Ranching, Gov. Umahi resorted to rabble rousing. He has told several lies to cover up his dubious maneuverings. He has lied against Ndigbo and Ime-Obi Ohanaeze Ndigbo, in order to curry the favour of his paymasters. He lied that there is a law in Ebonyi state on anti-open grazing.\n\n\u201cBut he knows that no such bill has ever been presented to the House not to talk of such a law being made. Yet people are being killed and murdered all over the state and Igboland and he goes about shedding crocodile tears. As Chairman of South-East Governors Forum, Umahi told several lies about preparations for regional security until his elder brother, a retired Army Officer, Gen. Obi Umahi exposed his treachery by resigning his position as the Commander of Ebubeagu and Chairman of the South East Regional Security Advisory Board, citing the unseriousness of the South-East Governors on security issues as the reason for his exit.Now it is clear to Ndigbo that Gov. Umahi is an Igbo nemesis because of the role he plays as a self-appointed Caliphate sympathiser, based on his touted 2023 presidential aspiration.\u201d",

We are bringing them to again render top-notch service in another capacity to further guarantee the safety of our people.\n\n\u201cAs a State that has given road infrastructure its deserved attention, having rehabilitated and constructed several roads across the State since coming into office, we are resolved to complement this gesture by ensuring sanity on our roads so that our road infrastructure programme will perform its role as a socio-economy booster.\n\n\u201cThe lives, health and safety of the people as well as the ability of government to perform its security role are intricately linked to a large extent to the way you perform this role at this critical time.\n\n\u201cI would therefore like to take this opportunity to implore the Road Safety Corps to enforce Covid-19 protocols, especially at this time when the deadly Delta variant has assumed a more virulent and fatal dimension. This is the time to put life above pecuniary considerations\u201d.\n\nThe Secretary to the Advisory Council and State Sector Commander of the FRSC, Mr Paul Okpe, had earlier in his address said the initiative would further guarantee safety on the roads and reduce the rate of mishaps on highways across Nigeria.",

          "text": "Nigerian Bamidele Muraina from Oyo State has been sentenced to U.S. federal prison for tax fraud and for filing bogus jobless claims in the state of Washington.\n\nHe is the second Nigerian, after Abidemi Rufai of Ogun, to be arrested over the massive fraudulent jobless claims that hit the U.S. state last year.\n\nMuraina, who lived in Atlanta, also hacked into tax preparation firms and filed fraudulent tax returns using stolen personally identifiable information.\n\nHis co-conspirator, Gabriel Kalembo, a previously convicted fraudster helped him to launder the fraudulent assets,\n\n\u201cThese defendants stole funds from programs meant to assist American workers and families seeking to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine.\n\n\u201cThe collaborative efforts of our law enforcement partners were essential to disrupting a sophisticated network of criminals and bringing their leaders to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conspirators not only stole from the government but also victimized individuals and private businesses in this case,\u201d said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge James E. Dorsey.\n\n\u201cRecovering from ID theft often costs time, money, and stress for all parties involved. Thanks to successful partnerships with our agency counterparts and leveraging our financial expertise to serve and protect our communities from further harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on us all. The enterprise created by these serial criminals further victimized our citizenry by robbing them of financial resources that were intended to help them,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Steven Baisel, U.S. Secret Service Atlanta Field Office. \u201cThanks to our judicial system, justice has been served.\u201d\n\n\u201cBamidele Muraina engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the Employment Security Department of Washington State (\u201cESD-WA\u201d) by filing dozens of fraudulent unemployment insurance (UI) claims in the names of identity theft victims who were not entitled to such benefits.\n\nAs part of the same conspiracy, Gabriel Kalembo and his conspirators laundered the unlawfully obtained UI benefits from ESD-WA by purchasing and then later negotiating hundreds of money orders.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and state workforce agencies to protect the integrity of unemployment insurance benefit programs,\u201d said Rafiq Ahmad, Special Agent in Charge, Atlanta Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.\n\n\u201cThe sentencing of the defendants should serve as a deterrent to all who intend to exploit the COVID-relief programs that were designated to assist those in need during the pandemic,\u201d said Tommy D. Coke, Inspector in Charge of the Atlanta Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service. \u201cPostal Inspectors will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate anyone that steals federal funds to enrich themselves and have them held accountable under the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese criminals shamelessly stole people\u2019s hard-earned tax returns and money meant to help families during the pandemic, but thankfully they were exposed and are now facing justice,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Katrina W. Berger, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. \u201cHSI and its law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively pursue those that seek to profit from these activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Acting U.S. Attorney Erskine, the charges and other information presented in court: Bamidele Muraina was a Nigerian national residing in the metro Atlanta area at the time of his offenses.\n\nBetween at least January 29, 2018 and continuing through approximately April 2020, Muraina hacked into multiple tax preparation and accounting firms located in several states, including a Brunswick, Georgia-based accounting firm. Muraina obtained access to the firms\u2019 accounts with a national tax preparation program, stole personally identifiable information from their clients, and filed more than 275 fraudulent individual income tax returns in their names via the Internet.\n\nIn total, Muraina\u2019s fraudulent tax returns using stolen identities sought refunds from the IRS exceeding $2.6 million from 2018 through 2020.\n\nBetween May 9, 2020 and May 16, 2020, Muraina used stolen personally identifiable information from Washington residents to submit false claims for unemployment insurance benefits in Washington.\n\nMuraina\u2019s false claims exploited a federal COVID-19 pandemic relief program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits and provided an additional unemployment benefit of $600 per week.\n\nBased on Muraina\u2019s fraudulent claims submitted in the names of approximately fifty Washington residents over a one-week span, the State of Washington issued more than $280,000 in unemployment benefits.\n\nMuraina directed fraudulent funds from his unemployment benefits scheme and tax fraud scheme to be deposited into bank accounts set up by co-conspirators, including Gabriel Kalembo, who was convicted in 2017 of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud in the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nKalembo recruited Zambian nationals to travel to the United States on tourist visas to incorporate sham corporations in Georgia and open business bank accounts in the names of those corporations.\n\nAfter the fraudulent funds were deposited into those accounts, Kalembo laundered the funds by cashing money orders purchased with debit cards linked to the accounts.\n\nBamidele Muraina of Oyo, Nigeria was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William M. Ray II in Atlanta, to five years and ten months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.\n\nHe ordered Muraina to pay $561,125.62 in restitution.\n\nGabriel Kalembo of Atlanta, Georgia was sentenced by Judge Ray to four years and two months in prison to be followed by two years of supervised release, and he ordered Kalembo to pay $298,008.71 in restitution.\n\nThis case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, the Department of Homeland Security-Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Nathan P. Kitchens, Chief of the Public Integrity and Special Matters Section, Sarah E. Klapman, and Lauren T. Macon are prosecuting the case.",

Interestingly, the presidency was quiet. What do you call this if it is not inequity, selective justice and brazen clannishness?\n\nNigeria\u2019s future is gravely endangered. At least, that is the grim conclusion by many despondent Nigerians concerning the country\u2019s socio-political and economic uncertainties under the Buhari administration. Severe issues such as national security architecture are, unfortunately, politicized, treated with puerile and sentimental mien.\n\nMany have wondered why the presidency under the APC-led administration is being reduced to some religious and ethnic bigotry. All these are at the expense of the blood of the ordinary citizens. This is what the altercation between Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State and President Buhari-led Federal Government has clearly further revealed.\n\nGovernor Ortom made a very disturbing revelation in an interview he granted Channels Television last Tuesday where he accused the Federal Government and the President. He accused the president of lopsided appointments into security positions along religious, clannish and ethnic lines, which shows that he is insensitive to the stakes of other sections of the country. He has alleged that as a sitting governor, he has been blocked from meeting the president.\n\nThe governor accused President Buhari of partiality and selective justice in its handling of the controversial issues of ranching, Ruga, as well as the so-called grazing route in the country.\n\nHistorically, the Benue State Government set a pace for modern cattle rearing through ranching as a panacea to the unending herders/farmers conflict in many parts of the country, especially in the North-central with particular reference to Benue, Plateau, Nasarawa and Kogi States. It went further to establish a law banning open grazing in the state, a development that led to a bitter feud with the Federal Government.\n\nSince the law against open grazing was made public, killings of farmers and peasants by suspected herders have continued unabated in the state without any well-meaning interventions by the Federal Government. Benue State has one of the festering internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in the country.\n\nOrtom accused Buhrai of partiality saying that while he (the president) is against ranching policy in Benue, gave Governor Aminu Masari the sum of N6billion commence implementation of ranching policy in Katsina.\n\nLike many Nigerians, we are taken aback that instead of the presidency to address the grave allegations raised by Governor Ortom, it resorted to sentimentalism and propaganda.\n\nIn a statement signed by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), the presidency described Ortom\u2019s style of administration as \u201csectarianism and ethnicity\u201d and \u201cplaying on ethnic themes thereby causing deaths of innocent Nigerians by \u201cinciting farmers against herders, and Christians against Muslims. Specifically, Ortom stirs up hatred by targeting one single ethnic group in Nigeria \u2013 using language reminiscent of the Rwandan genocide\u201d.\n\nThere should have been a better craftsmanship in that speech that lacks decorum and tact, which has defined the response system of the present administration against all constructive criticisms since inception. This is not only wrong but condemnable. Governor Ortom has not said anything different from many Nigerian statesmen and leaders of thoughts who are exercising their freedom of expression.\n\nRecently, Governor Masari who reportedly received N6billion to implement ranching policy told the people of Katsina to take up arms in self defence against bandits and terrorists who have made life a living hell by killing and abducting innocent Nigerians in the state. Interestingly, the presidency was quiet; however, if that statement was made by Ortom or any other national leader who is not a member of the APC, the presidency would have risen up in an impulsively acidic reaction. What do you call this if it is not inequity, selective justice and brazen clannishness?\n\nWe note with dismay that this presidency is overtly partisan in its leadership quality, policies and actions. This is indeed often demonstrated in its reactions to the citizens\u2019 genuine views about its policies and programmes.\n\nAnother recent instance happened last week when a retired Navy Commodore, Kunle Olawunmi, granted Channels Television an explosive where he bared his mind on the burning national security challenges in the country and the unwillingness of the government to curtail the ugly trend. Some media reports stated that he is now being persecuted by President Buhari administration because he dared to speak the truth about the facts that the present government is not ready to fight the ongoing insurgency, herders/farmers clashes and banditry in the country.\n\nThe retired intelligence officer has unimpeachable facts about the issues and the rots in the Buhari administration. He revealed that confessions by some arrested insurgents showed that the government has the list of sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria among who are governors and persons inside the corridors of power.\n\nThe revelation did not go down well with the Buhari government. He has since been invited by the Defence Headquarters \u201cto share\u201d more light on what they already know. The TV Station that conducted the interviews granted by Ortom and Olawunmi, Channels TV, is now reportedly being sanctioned or queried by the regulatory authorities for alleged unprofessional conduct and for allegedly promoting hate speech and incitement against government.\n\nA government that hates constructive criticism and truth stands a risk of collapse.

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami has said more than 13,000 projects executed in Nigeria\u2019s niger delta area were substantially compromised despite the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) receiving $14.580 billion allocation from 2001 to 2019.\n\nMr Malami said this on Thursday when he spoke on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari at the presentation of a report on the forensic audit of the NDDC.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is particularly concerned with the colossal loss occasioned by uncompleted and unverified development projects in the Niger Delta region, in spite of the huge resources made available to uplift the living standard of the citizens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that considerable resources have been channelled by the Federal Government to the development of the Niger Delta from 2001 to 2019,\u201d Mr Malami said.\n\nWithin 19 years, from 2001 and 2019, Malami said the federal government approved over N3.3 trillion to the agency as budgetary allocation and N2.4trillion as \u201cincome from statutory and non-statutory sources\u201d.\n\nThis, according to him, \u201cbrings the total figure to the sum of approximately six trillion Naira given to the Niger Delta Development Commission\u201d.\n\nThe minister said despite this, \u201cWe have on record over 13,777 projects, the execution of which is substantially compromised\u201d.\n\nTo add to the poorly executed or non-execution of contracts, Mr Malami pointed out the issue of the agency running 362 bank accounts resulting in a lack of proper reconciliation of accounts.\n\n\u201cThe federal government will, in consequence, apply the law to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the audit report as appropriate.\n\n\u201cThis will include, but not limited to, initiation of criminal investigations, prosecution, recovery of funds not properly utilised for the public purposes for which they were meant for, review of the laws to reposition and restructure the NDDC for the efficiency of better service delivery, amongst others.\n\n\u201cIn all these instances of actions, legal due processes will strictly be complied with.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
