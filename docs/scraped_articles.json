The police should not have ethnic and religious colouration.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of Nigeria is the highest law of the land, and the Constitution says that if any other law is in variance with the constitution, that law will be null and void.\n\n\u201cThere is a part of the Constitution that established Nigerian Police Council, which has the President as the chairman; it has the chairman of the Police Service Commission as member and the 36 state governors are also members. They are the only ones that have the constitutional right to approve dressing code for the Nigerian Police.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that the plan of the government is to Islamise Nigeria and warned that such move is dangerous and a breach of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe use of hijab is a breach of the constitution of the country and if you are a governor and breached the Constitution of the land, it is impeachment.

We can do it if we cooperate with each other.\n\n\u201cThe situation where killer herdsmen take shelter with our neighbours, sneak in and kill our people without provocation will not be tolerated any longer.\u201d\n\nHe called on security agencies to continue to cooperate with the people of the state to end what he described as bloodletting.\n\n\u201cLet us dislodge these invaders from wherever they may be hiding for peace to return to our communities,\u201d Ortom added.\n\nWhile commending the security agencies for their steadfastness and commitment to ending the crises, Ortom called on Benue people to begin to arm themselves with \u201clawful weapons as prescribed by law and defend themselves against the Fulani invaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no longer fashionable to continue to cry out for help. We must now be at alert and ready to confront these killers.

          "text": "Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State\n\n\u2026APC members should remain calm, law-abiding\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nThe member representing Ikwo/Ezza South Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Hon. Comrade Chinedu Ogah (OON), Wednesday, stated that those politicians plotting to takeover Ebonyi Government House through the back door must be Jokers.\n\nHe explained that the ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which sacked Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe was riddled with some elements of judicial errors.\n\nOgah who is a Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Ebonyi State, stated this while briefing newmen on the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s Federal High Court ruling in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, there are three ways whereby a Governor can vacate his office: it\u2019s either by death, resignation and impeachment.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Governor Theodore Orji of Abia State defected from PPA to PDP, Governor of Benue State, Samuel Orton defected from APC to PDP; a case study is that of Governor Peter Obi who defected from from APGA to PDP. These Governors defected but were not removed from office.\n\n\u201cAnother case in point is that of Governor Rochas Okorocha who defected from APGA to APC. In the case of Atiku and the Attorney General of the Federation during the time of Obasanjo when Atiku defected to ACN. The Supreme court held that Atiku has the right.\n\n\u201cI want to urge the Governor not to be distracted but to remain focused on his developmental agenda for the State.\u201d\n\nOgah who explained that the Court ruling was merely intended to temporarily distract Governor Umahi who has done so much for Ebonyi people added that he was optimistic that the present judicial turbulence would soon fizzle away with Governor Umahi emerging victorious.\n\n\u201cThe present judicial turbulence is a mere distraction but we believe that an appellant court of competent jurisdiction will do justice by instituting the right judgement. The matter has gone on Appeal and so, there\u2019s no cause for alarm.\n\n\u201cI want to urge all APC members to remain calm and law-abiding as there\u2019s no cause for alarm. I want to urge the Governor to be focused on his developmental strides that he is doing in Ebonyi State.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS) has said it is looking to introduce a strict ethical standard for commodity brokers.\n\nThe integrity and professionalism make up one of the components of the Memorandum of Understanding jointly signed in Abuja on Tuesday by CIS and AFEX, a platform that harnesses Africa\u2019s commodities and talent to build shared wealth and prosperity.\n\nSpeaking during the MoU signing ceremony, the President and Chairman of Council, CIS, Mr Tunde Amolegbe, said: \u201cIntegrity, ethics and professionalism run through every single activity we do. Of course, that is also what is expected as we now partner with AFEX, and we now bring on board, commodity brokers into our institute.\n\n\u201cThe standard which we have set for other professionals playing in other marketplaces is not going to be watered down. As a matter of fact, I will make bold to say that it is probably going to be tightened even more in the case of the commodity brokers, and dealers in this market to ensure that some of the unforeseen circumstances that have arisen in other markets do not find their way into this market.\u201d\n\nAmolegbe said the relationship between the CIS and AFEX was anchored on the need to expose commodity brokers to professional global standards through continuous training.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am sure that AFEX itself already has structures in place to ensure that the integrity of all the transactions that is carried out here meets up to the standard expected by the Stock Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cSo, our expectation is that the practitioners too would practice at a level of integrity that bears marks of professionalism under the umbrella of CIS.\u201d\n\nBy the MOU, commodity brokers are subject to compliance with some requirements, including participation in the regulatory body\u2019s professional development programmes.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that, as certified and recognized commodity brokers, they will be able to practice under a code of governance and practice that meets international standards,\u201d Amolegbe added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of AFEX, Ayodeji Balogun, said the partnership will support his company\u2019s efforts in facilitating the transitioning from commodities to capital for shared prosperity both for the producer, the retail investor, and the participating investment market.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe do measure all our transactions and instruments against the Sustainability Development Goals. So, for every investment asset we have, we do tie it to what problem is it solving and what quantum of that solution is it providing in the light of the UN SDGs.\n\n\u201cFor everything we do, we measure ourselves along five lines; ending hunger, ending poverty, gender equity, responsible consumption, and a decent job. We all agree these five things are essentially the crux of the problem in Nigeria. So, the more we can rally the capital market towards solving these issues, the better we have a country and the more impact we make as a market,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the impact of the partnership on the broader economy, Balogun stated: \u201cAgriculture in Nigeria is significantly underfunded, and that is primarily because everywhere else in the world, nobody buys commodities today. Everyone buys futures, but until we have a commodities exchange, we won\u2019t be able to deliver that.\n\n\u201cSo, we see an N2 trillion gap in agricultural financing, and we are definitely positioned to solve that problem. To achieve the expected result is where the intersection between the commodity sector itself and also the capital market and the Stock Exchange Commission makes that happen.\u201d\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s so much that an individual investor, particularly the diaspora investor, can do; stressing that the stockbroking community and the investment public are an excellent distribution channel to be able to make individual investors participate and enjoy returns and grow wealth.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nThe Society of Women Accountants of Nigeria, SWAN, Abakaliki proposed Chapter, Tuesday called on the National Assembly to reconsider all the proposed gender and affirmative action bills in the 5th Constitution Amendment Bills.\n\nThese bills, which were rejected on Tuesday 1st March 2022, by the National Assembly, according to SWAN, would have gone a long way to correct gender imbalance across the Legislative arm of Government and reduce the under-representation of women in political offices.\n\nThe 10th National Chairperson, SWAN, Nwamara Catherine Nnaji stated this during the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day celebration at Girls High School, Aziyiokwu, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cThis action by the men of the 9th NASS has taken the country backwards. Their actions undermine the importance and relevance of women\u2019s contribution to the governance of Nigeria, including the key role women play to bring victory to political parties in elections at all levels across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are joining Nigerian women to demand that all gender bills be reconsidered. The adoption of these bills will not only benefit women but Nigeria and Nigerians as a whole.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, the Chairperson, SWAN Abakaliki proposed Chapter, Obiekwe Lucy Chinwe noted that SWAN was poised to strategize and ensure that the Accounting profession remains relevant and plays a leading role in the global economy.\n\nAccording to her, today, being a day for women, what better way to celebrate women than to affect the lives of intending mothers, knowing for sure that you can be what you want to be once you set your eyes and work towards it.\n\nShe further explained that the theme of this year\u2019s celebration, \u201cBreaking Barrier\u201d, \u201cwas very apt as women are making waves in every aspect of the world economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsequently, this year\u2019s celebration is poised to celebrate every woman achiever in our society. Every woman who has broken the gender barrier and has risen to be a woman of note, we celebrate them today. I want to know that this can be you.\u201d\n\nThe SWAN Abakaliki proposed Chapter used to occasion of the celebration to educate and enlighten the student\u2019s Girls High School, Aziyiokwu, Abakaliki on the activities of the Society and how they can utilize their potentials to achieve greatness.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Badejo and Success Omonijo\n\nBuhari rebuffs lobbyists\n\nYobe governor, Akpanudoedehe excluded from convention committee\n\nSenate caucus stands by CECPC chair\n\nParty releases NWC zoning formula\n\nNEC meeting for March 17\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai last night explained why the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker chairman had to be pushed aside.\n\nAccording to him, certain actions and inactions of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni put the ruling party at risk because they were a hindrance to the plan to hold the convention on March 26.\n\nEl-Rufai, who spoke on a Channels Television programme, said he had the authority of Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu to explain the action that led to the appointment of Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello as acting chairman of APC.\n\nHe said 19 of the 23 governors elected on the ticket of the party were on same page on the mission to prevent the party from collapsing. He did not name the four governors that are not with them.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who is on two-week medical vacation in London, it was gathered, has rebuffed lobbyists trying to bring back Buni.\n\nBuni and Caretaker Secretary James Akpanudoedehe have been excluded from the revised caretaker committee, inaugurated yesterday by acting Chairman Sani Bello.\n\nThe party announced March 17 for the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.\n\nEl-Rufai said the governors met with President Buhari on Sunday, shortly before his London trip to obtain his approval for the plan to proceed with preparations for the convention and to hold a NEC meeting to ratify critical decision ons way the forward.\n\nHe confirmed that an injunction has been obtained following a request from the court by a party member to the effect that the party should not hold its convention until his grievances have been addressed.\n\nEl-Rufai, who said Buni was aware and neither informed the party nor did anything on it, said efforts had commenced now to vacate the injunction which he described as \u201ca weapon of mass destruction\u201d, planned to use to scuttle the convention.\n\nHe said the fate of caretaker secretary James Akpanudoedehe had been decided after he refused to take instruction from acting Chairman Bello who took over on Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai said: \u201cWe got a wind of a court process wherein an order had been gotten directing that the convention should not be held until the determination of the case. And it was unfortunate that, our lawyer engaged by Buni-led committee agreed with this in court. If this remains, how can the convention be done?\n\n\u201cWe got signals that there were some elements in the party that were bent on scuttling the proposed March 26 convention.\n\n\u201cAnd if we miss that date, the following Saturday, will be Ramadan and that means we would not be able to have convention until after Ramadan. That means we would have lost another month according to INEC\u2019s timetable.\n\n\u201cBased on this, we met with the president to discuss a number of issues with him like zoning formulae, which the president signed off on.\n\n\u201cWe went the second time to inform the president that the zoning formula he signed off on had not been sent back to us.\n\n\u201cInstead, we were hearing about another list, which we knew was not from Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThe President agreed with us and directed that with immediate effect, Governor Buni must go and that Governor Bello should take over the headship of the party.\n\n\u201cThe president directed that we must do everything possible to ensure the convention holds. I can tell you that Bello has the full backing of the president and at least 19 of the 23 APC governors. Then, you can see that since Monday that Bello took over, we have made a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nAsked if their action was constitutional, El-Rufai said: \u201cWe had to intervene when we saw that the party was drifting and we are happy and satisfied with our action, though some didn\u2019t want the party to progress.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that some politicians\u2019 ambition was putting the party at risk and the President was not happy when he heard about the sinister motive.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that Mai Mala has stepped aside and I can assure you that when he returns to the country, he will not assume any position.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any personal disagreement with Mai Mala Buni, as he was also a victim of many of the intrigues that played out.\u201d\n\nOn the secretary, he said: \u201cThe CECCP has taken action on the secretary and I believe that whatever they do is done in accordance with the law.\n\n\u201cWe want to send the message to everyone that the party is no longer at risk and we are already reaching out to all sides and camps within the party.",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Abuja, Ogochukwu Anioke, Abakiliki and Robert Egbe\n\nEbonyi State Governor David Umahi came under fire yesterday for his tirade against Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe judge, on Tuesday, ruled that the governor and his deputy, Eric Igwe, be sacked for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nJustice Ekwo ordered 16 lawmakers in the House of Assembly, who defected from the PDP to the APC, to vacate their seats.\n\nFaulting the judgment, Umahi accused the judge of being a \u201chatchet man\u201d, who was \u201con a mission,\u201d and implied that the judgment was \u201cpurchased\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have petitioned him to NJC (National Judicial Council) and we will follow it up to ensure that this man is brought to justice,\u201d Umahi added.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) demanded an apology from the governor and a retraction of the \u201coffensive\u201d comments.\n\nIts president, Olumide Akpata, described the governor\u2019s comments attacking the judiciary as \u201cdisgraceful, undemocratic and completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNBA said it was utterly dismayed by the Umahi\u2019s \u201cunfortunate and totally unacceptable\u201d reaction to the judgment.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cUmahi\u2026threw caution to the wind and deployed very uncomplimentary adjectives and intemperate language in characterising both the judgment and Hon. Justice Ekwo, including but not limited to describing the judgment as \u2018jungle justice\u2019 and His Lordship as \u2018a hatchet man\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs if these were not enough, Engr. Umahi accused the court of \u2018murdering justice\u2019 and also arrogated to himself the judicial powers and magisterial authority to declare the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction as null and void while unashamedly declaring his intention to disregard the judgment in favour of another.\n\n\u201cTo put it plainly, this is impunity of the highest order and executive rascality taken too far.\u201d\n\nAkpata said the leadership of the NBA was inundated with calls from well-meaning Nigerians who were outraged by Umahi\u2019s utterances.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we condemn without equivocation, Engr. Umahi\u2019s unfortunate diatribe which, if it had emanated from an average litigant, would still have been regarded as shocking but coming from one who occupies the exalted office of a State Governor, is nothing short of a national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the judgment, one would have expected Engr. Umahi to sue for calm from his supporters and to assure them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the Judgment.\n\n\u201cFor H.E. Engr. Umahi to instead resort to attacking and denigrating the high office of a judge in this unprecedented manner is disgraceful, undemocratic and completely unacceptable\u2026\n\n\u201cWe view Engr. Umahi\u2019s reaction to this judgment as being consistent with the current penchant, on the part of those in the executive arm of government, for intimidating the Judiciary whilst taking advantage of the historical reluctance of that arm of government to rise to its own defence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the foregoing, the NBA hereby demands an immediate apology from H.E. Engr. Dave Umahi and a retraction of the comments he made against the person and judgment of the Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cIt is also our demand that this apology and retraction be given as much media coverage as the press conference where the unfortunate comments were made.\u201d\n\nUmahi: PDP misled judge\n\nSpeaking in Abakaliki, the state capital while addressing a crowd of residents who embarked on a solidarity walk for him, the governor said the PDP misled the judge.\n\nHe urged them to be calm and law-abiding as he was confident of securing victory at the appeal court.\n\nHe said the judge was misled by PDP lawyers and that he had confidence in the judiciary.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cI want to thank Nigerians; I want to thank Ebonyi people. I was doing my projects inspection when the Deputy Governor called to inform me that Ebonyi people are here.\n\n\u201cI am just here to urge you to be very peaceful and to assure you that we still have very serious confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe NBA chairman published something and that I said the judge is biased but when we spoke this afternoon (yesterday), we understood ourselves.\n\n\u201cI say that the lawyers of PDP were the people that did the hatchet job. I am going to write to NBA to discipline them. The judge was misled.\n\n\u201cIn the Bayelsa case, there was a defect in the deputy governor\u2019s credentials but the Supreme Court said the votes cast belonged to the individuals, not the party.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers knew about this, they misled the judge. So the blame is not on the judge; the blame is to the PDP lawyers.\n\n\u201cI am using this opportunity to let Nigerians know that nobody castigated the judge and we will not.\n\nGovernor, others file appeal\n\nUmahi, Igwe and 16 members of the state House of Assembly have appealed the judgment.\n\nIn two notices of appeal filed by their lawyer, Chukwuma Machukwu Umeh (SAN), Umahi, Igwe and others are praying the Court of Appeal to set aside Justice Ekwo\u2019s judgement.\n\nIn the notice of appeal filed for Umahi and Igwe, 11 grounds of appeal were raised, while five grounds were raised in the notice of appeal filed for the 16 lawmakers.\n\nThe appellants argued that the trial court erred in law when it held that the provision of Section 308 of the Constitution was not applicable to the case.\n\n\u201cThe Hon trial court was virtually setting aside the Supreme court of Nigeria\u2019s decision in AG Federation v. Atiku Abubakar & 3 ORS (2007) LCN/3799(SC) to the effect that there are no constitutional provisions prohibiting President or vice and invariably the Governor and or deputy Governor from defecting to another political party,\u201d they said.\n\nThey also contended that the trial court erred in law and misdirected itself when it relied on Sections 68 and 109 of the Constitution to hold that the appellants, having defected from the PDP to the APC, offended the provisions of the Constitution and must vacate their offices as governor and deputy governor respectively.\n\n\u201cThere is no specific mention of governor and deputy governor in the provisions of sections 68 and 109 respectively of the 1999 Constitution (as amended)\n\n\u201cBy relying on sections 68 and 109 of the Constitution the trial court assumed the role of the legislator and arrogated to itself the powers of amendment of the Constitution\n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which state that governor or deputy governor will vacate his office if he defects from his political party to another political party,\u201d they said.\n\nThe appellants added that the trial court erred in law and overruled the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria when it held that the ownership of votes cast during the governorship election of 2019 belongs to the first respondent (the PDP) and not the appellants.\n\n\u201cThe trial court relied on Amaechi v. INEC and Faleke v. INEC when same are no longer the law on the ownership of votes cast in an election,\u201d they said.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Wednesday approved the immediate ban of foreigners buying farm produce directly from farmers.\n\nForeigners will now have to go through licensed local buying agents to do business with the farmers.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe move, the government is to ensure that the farmers are no longer cheated in the purchase of their farm produce.\n\nMinister of Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, who briefed on the approval by council, said he presented two memos on behalf of his ministry before FEC one of which was the promotion of agribusiness in Nigeria through right farm gate pricing and ban on foreigners and their representatives from purchasing agricultural commodities at the farm gates.\n\nHe said council approved the establishment of an appropriate mechanism that would not only protect the indigenous farmers in terms of achieving the right prices for their goods and commodities, but also ensure that they have the appropriate incentives and the needed encouragement to guarantee their continued participation in the farming business.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, over the years, foreigners have been going to the farm gates to buy produce from the farmers at low prices, thus discouraging the farmers from continuing with their trade.\n\nHe said: \u201cwe finally got approval from FEC today for only licensed local buying agents who must be registered by the relevant national commodity associations, they are the ones who now will be able to buy goods directly from the farmers and sell to the foreigners.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cThis way, the farmers will no longer be cheated by these foreigners who just throw money at them and are able to buy their goods\u201d.\n\nThe Minister also disclosed that he presented another memo to FEC for the approval of Trade Policy Action Plan with the theme \u201cUnleasing Nigeria\u2019s Development Potentials through Trade and Investment\u201d.\n\nHe said the Action Plan which was also approved by Council was formulated with a view to utilising trade as another means of generating revenue outside oil whose revenue is on the downward trend.\n\nAdebayo said: \u201cThe whole idea is that because we\u2019re not making as much money as we used to from sale of oil, and because of reduction in the money that comes from that aspect of Nigeria\u2019s revenue generation, we want to utilize trade as a means of generating revenue for the country. So, the action plan aims to utilise the existing national trade policy to facilitate an effective use of international trade and investment as tools for economic growth and poverty reduction in the country.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve got approval from Council today to engage with all the ministries, departments and agencies involved in trade and revenue generation, and also the organized private sector and civil society organisations to ensure a successful implementation of the trade policy action plan.\n\n\u201cOne of the next steps that we will be taking now that we have this approval, is to inaugurate a committee which will look into the update of the existing trade policy, which was last updated in 2002. And also, we\u2019ll be looking into coming up with an investment policy. And these two policies we believe should be ready before the end of this year\u201d.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOn his part, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, said FEC okayed the introduction of another layer of quality assurance certificate in government digital services.\n\nHe explained that before now, all federal public institutions have been mandated by law and also by government policies, that before they embark on any information technology project, they must obtain IT Project Clearance to embark on it.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThere are so many benefits of that, this is provided for in NITDA Act 2007, Section 6, under Article A and the federal government has re-emphasize that through a circular on 31st August 2018. So many federal public institutions have been complying with this and the report is very commendable. We presented the report before the Federal Executive Council today. The report covers 1st of January, 2021 to 31st December ,2021. This is a copy of the report; IT Project Clearance Performance Report for Government Digital Services 2021.\n\n\u201cThis report captures all the IT projects in the country, particularly towards our government digital services for the whole year. In that report, it is clearly mentioned that 282 major projects were submitted for clearance, out of this number 258 were cleared and 24 were rejected and the total amount submitted seeking for permission to implement the project was over N213 billion by many federal public institutions.\n\n\u201cOut of this, NITDA cleared around N154 billion and if you compute the amount submitted and the amount approved, you will discover that we are able to save more than N24 billion for the federal government of Nigeria. More than N24 billion, comparing the proposed amount and the approved amount for the implementation\u201d.\n\nAccording to Pantami, this development was part of the strategies of introducing ICT Projects Clearance; one, to save costs; two, to fight corruption and this is very important.\n\n\u201cWe have been discovering so many cases that are suspicious and we reviewed them critically, draw the attention of institutions, where necessary. Sometimes some institutions were able to report it to Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or any institution of government as the case may be.\n\n\u201cAlso, part of the benefits is to ensure the security of our digital facilities because part of the clearance any project submitted is going to be reviewed critically to ensure that the security of our country, particularly our cyberspace, is not going to be compromised. Also, the clearance makes sure that it is in compatibility with the Digital Economy Policy and Strategy, Nigeria e-Government Enterprise Architecture, Nigeria e-Government Interoperability Framework. These are some of the benefits of the clearance.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said FEC also approved another layer that any project that is up to N1 billion, after completing the project, that institution is mandated and directed to obtain quality assurance certificate from the National Information Technology Development Agency.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reasons for introducing this layer are many, but some of them like number one, we discover that sometimes an approval or clearance could be granted in the cost of implementation, some of the specifications will be changed and if there is no quality assurance certificate, we will not be able to know whether the project is implemented according to the clearance or not.\n\n\u201cSecondly, it is part of building a system. Some of the stages of building a system include feasibility study, preliminary investigation, system analysis, system design, system coding, and also system implementation, and also system testing. So, it is through system testing, we will be able to certify and confirm the quality of that system, whether it\u2019s assured or not.\n\n\u201cSo, what is most important from today henceforth, any ICT project that is not N1 billion, after obtaining the clearance, at the end of the project, that institution is required to look for quality assurance certificate, so that we will be able to drive the maximum benefit of that government investment\u201d.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nASUU has been on strike since February 14 over a face-off with the Federal Government which included the non acceptance of UTAS as the payment platform to replace the Integrated Personnel and Payment Information System, IPPIS.\n\nWhile the government had insisted that UTAS had failed the necessary tests that should qualify it to be used as a payment platform, ASUU on the other hand, accused the government of not being ready to accept its alternative platform to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS).\n\nAsked to give update on UTAS being one of contentious issues that led to the ongoing ASUU strike, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, explained he acted on the letter from the Minister of Labor and Employment, Chris Ngige requesting a review of the submission and the technical ability of the software of the system, by forwarding it to NITDA for action.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThey (NITDA) conducted their own analysis, their own testing and sent same back to me, and I drafted a cover letter I forwarded to the Minister of Labour and Employment and I copied the two Ministers of Education, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, and also office of the Accountant General of the Federation and even NUC (National University Commission).\u201d\n\nThe Minister then directed the DG of NITDA, to give an update on the request.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nGiving clarification on the position of UTAS, Inuwa said, \u201cWhen we received the request to review, UTAS, you know, building complex system like UTAS that involves employees\u2019 personal data, and also payment system, we have to subject it to do best practice tests before approving. Normally, when we are reviewing that kind of system, we perform three tests.\n\n\u201cFirstly, because when you\u2019re building system, it\u2019s not just about the technology, you need to consider the people that will use this system and the process. If you don\u2019t align people, process and technology, you will never get result. No matter how good the technology is, if the people don\u2019t understand how to use it, they won\u2019t use it. And if the process is different from the way the people work, also, they won\u2019t use it. So that is a process of building technology.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cFirstly, you need to get the business requirement. What do you want to achieve? So it\u2019s not the technology that will come first, it is the business requirement, what do you want to achieve, then you need to identify the capabilities you need to achieve that is your business objective.\n\n\u201cPart of the capability is the technology you need to bring in and the people that will operate the technology before you start thinking of the technology, because technology is always a tool that will help you to achieve an objective or to do your work. If you bring the tool before knowing what to do with it, it will be useless.\n\n\u201cSo when they came, we said okay, fine, we will do user acceptance test, ASUU you\u2019ve built this system, but you are not the one that will use the system. There are people in Bursary, and all those in finance that will use this system. So we need to do user acceptance test with them, let them come and show the system, let them see if it can help them to do the work there.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we said we\u2019ll do vulnerability test to test the security integrity of the system. Because if there is vulnerability, people can hack it, they can change and it involves financial transactions. Adding zero means a lot. So we say we need to do that.\n\n\u201cAnd also we need to do stress test. You can build a system on your laptop or on a small computer, use it but when you put so many data it will crash, we need to do the stress test to make sure that system can do. This is on the system. Then also you need to have a data center where you need to put that system because just having a system without the data center it will not operate also.\n\n\u201cSo we did all these three tests with them. And the system couldn\u2019t pass. We wrote the reports and submitted it back to the Honorable Minister, which he forwarded to all relevant institutions, including ASUU. As we speak now, ASUU is working, trying to fix all the issues we highlighted with the system and we will review it again, but that is just one half of the story.\n\n\u201cThe second half of the story also, we need to find where to put that system like IPPIS we have a data center built for it. ASUU where are we going to put it? That means we need to have the data center and also that data center, we need to check to make sure it meets minimum requirement. Because if you put people\u2019s information and the system crashes, how can you pay them salary?\n\n\u201cYou need to build redundancy. There are a lot of things to do. So but as we speak, they\u2019re trying to fix all the issues we highlighted with the system. Then when we finish that, we need to look at the second half of the story, getting where to install it.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Bello directs sale of forms this week or early next\n\n\u2022Buhari to join Tuesday\u2019s NEC meeting remotely\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nWorried by the recent turn of events in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which witnessed a dramatic change of guard, stakeholders in the party have started mulling a soft-landing for the displaced former chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, in order to save him from the embarrassment of his ouster.\n\nOne of the options said to being considered, THISDAY gathered last night, was to ask Buni to resign as CECPC chairman, either on the grounds of health or the need to face governance in his State.\n\nAt the same time, there was a pall of confusion yesterday at the national secretariat of the APC over the fate of the National Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nThis just as the new leadership is moving swiftly with preparations for the convention scheduled for March 26. THISDAY is reliably informed that printing of expression of interest forms has commenced and are expected to go on sale this week or early next week.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he, on the other hand, claimed he was still the secretary except President Muhammadu Buhari said otherwise.\n\nThis is as President Buhari has hinted that he would be part of next Tuesday\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party, summoned by the acting chairman of the CECPC and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, to address some of the raging crises in the party.\n\nSources in the APC told THISDAY last night that some of Buni\u2019s colleagues were unhappy with what had become of him and thought that rather leave him to be embarrassed, there should be a soft-landing that would quietly ease him out, even though someone else had taken over the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of the sources maintained that though he had been out of the country on medical trip, it might be easy to ask him to resign on health grounds and allow the party continue with its affairs.\n\nAnother suggestion before the party, however, was to ask him to resign in order to concentrate on his state, especially, as a first term governor, who might be interested in seeking re-election in 2023.\n\nA reliable source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that Bello said both Buni and Akpanudoedehe would be given soft-landing.\n\n\u201cThey are going to give the Secretary and Buni a soft-landing by asking them to resign. Buni will resign and say he wants to face governance in Yobe, while the secretary will tender his resignation and say he wants to pursue his governorship ambition. That is the soft-landing they are giving them.\n\n\u201cThat is the game plan on the ground. The NEC will now ratify the decision. The convention will hold, the date will not change and they will vacate the court order.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of the caretaker committee meeting yesterday, news filtered in that Akpanudoedehe had been forced to resign his position.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who also attended the meeting left the secretariat after the meeting ended.\n\nImmediately the news of his resignation rent the air at the secretariat of the party, the staff of the party started jubilating.\n\nThe story of his alleged resignation, however, forced Akpanudoedehe to come back to the secretariat to address journalists to deny the report about his resignation.\n\nHe insisted that he remained the national secretary of the party until President Buhari says otherwise.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said he wouldn\u2019t accept a situation, where some people would be dropping the name of the president, adding that he and Buni would wait until they hear directly from the President.\n\n\u201cI have read on social media that I have resigned as Secretary of the APC. I want to state that it is not true. I didn\u2019t resign. If I had resigned, you would have seen my letter of resignation written by me. Someone cannot just say somebody is dead when he is alive.\n\n\u201cI am not bigger than the party, or bigger than the President, who is a leader of the country. I am waiting for my national chairman to come back. This is not the first time you are seeing a power play. I am waiting for the Chairman. If we have a directive from the President that we should resign, we are not bigger than the President, we will do so, if we hear from him.\n\n\u201cSomebody cannot say go and announce he is resigning. Like MKO Abiola used to say, you don\u2019t shave someone\u2019s head in his absence. So, we have done so much. And you will agree with me that when we came in, this place was like a dead zone. The secretariat was moved to a private home. But we were committed to what we were doing. I am stating here that that breaking news is not from me. I don\u2019t know who announced it.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had received any letter from the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) asking him to resign, Akpanudoedehe added, \u201d I have not received any letter.\u201d\n\nBut he maintained: \u201cSomeone cannot say the President said. I have not received any letter from anywhere. As I said, nobody is bigger than the party. The issue is that, if I have resigned, the answer is no. I am the national secretary of the party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari is expected to join Bello\u2019s first NEC meeting next Tuesday virtually from London. The National Working Committee of the ruling party at its meeting on Tuesday resolved to hold its NEC next Tuesday at 11am.\n\nBuhari\u2019s virtual attendance, insider said, would serve to instill confidence in Bello\u2019s new leadership.\n\nAll members of the party\u2019s NEC, except Buni and Akpanudoedehe will attend the meeting, including all APC governors.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the party\u2019s national convention and the presidential primary would dominate the meeting.\n\nHowever, following the leadership change that occurred on Monday, Bello later met with APC state chairmen same night at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja.\n\nBello said his major task was to fix the party and ensure a successful National convention of the party at the stipulated date.\n\n\u201cOur main task is to fix the party and hold a convention. We all should be worried about the Convention. We need to hold our Convention so that we rectify past mistakes. I placed my absolute loyalty to you but I need your support,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing journalists after the caretaker committee meeting yesterday, Bello said the report of the zoning of party offices had been adopted and also announced the NEC meeting for next week.\n\nBello stated: \u201cThe report of the zoning formula has been submitted and adopted and it will be released any moment from now. I mean the zoning formula.\n\nHe said the meeting held yesterday was a continuation of Monday\u2019s meeting, and that the committee would meet everyday from now on.\n\nOn whether Akpanudoedehe was still part of the new leadership, Bello replied: \u201cask him\u201d.\n\nSenate APC Caucus Laments APC Crisis\n\nSenators elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, expressed deep concern over the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe federal lawmakers, who held a closed-door meeting after plenary at Senate room 301, however, confirmed that the Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, was merely acting for the ailing Governor Buni, as chairman of the party\u2019s caretaker committee.\n\nThey, therefore, urged all stakeholders to exercise caution to avoid any incident that could prevent the conduct of the March 26 convention of the party.\n\nSenate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, who briefed journalists after the two-hour meeting, described happenings in the APC as worrisome.\n\nHe said his colleagues would soon start peace moves to reconcile aggrieved stakeholders across the country.\n\nAbdullahi said, \u201cAPC senators met for about two hours. We are too worried about what is happening in our party and we expressed our concern over the challenges facing the party, very close to its national convention.\n\n\u201cWe thought as a very important stakeholders in the party, we want to draw the attention of everyone involved to come together and unite so that we can have very successful convention in the party.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for regrets about what we could do. What is happening is about the future of our party and government and also the capacity of our party to win elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have sat down as important stakeholders as a caucus in this great party, to dissect all the issues that have been affecting our party since the formation of the caretaker extraordinary convention planning committee.\n\n\u201cWe are quite aware of the challenges that they have faced and we are also aware of the successes that the committee had recorded particularly, when it comes to registration of members.\n\n\u201cThey came to harmonise some of the successes of the party, carrying out congresses at the ward, local government and at the state levels. The same convention planning committee is in place. What we realised is that the chairman of the convention planning committee has been sick and he went for medical checkup.\n\n\u201cThe current Niger State Governor, from the grapevine and from the knowledge that is available to us, is actually the deputy chairman and in the absence of the chairman, he is acting till the chairman comes back. The speculation in the papers is not exactly true.\n\n\u201cWhat we are concerned about is the seeming disarray in the party. So, from our standing coming from all the states in Nigeria, we have to come and establish a national platform, where all these things can be articulated so that all of us will come up with one mind and strategise for the success of the party.\n\n\u201cAll personal and individual bitter struggling for power is subordinated to the chances of the party \u2013 party\u2019s interest. So that the party would be strong. We are the strongest party; we have the largest membership, therefore, we should as much as possible move to make sure that our party is united in the interest of every member.\n\n\u201cWe commend the performance of that committee, we ask you to do more by as much as possible by trying to reconcile those chapters, where there are still challenges trailing the ward, local government and state congresses.\n\n\u201cThis is because, a loss in any state is a loss for the party. We cannot afford to come to the convention as a divided entity. Anywhere there are challenges that could cause the party its victory is a loss for everybody.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International, Dr. Daniel Olukoya, has asked the family of a Regional Pastor, Dan Osato Osamwonyi, abducted 10 months ago to keep praying instead of wasting money on the case.\n\nThe family alleged that the MFM GO had ignored the family, stressing that up till the moment, no single word or trace of pastor Daniel Osamwonyi had been seen and no call placed for a ransom.\n\nPastor Daniel Olukoya, General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM).\n\nSaharaReporters had on Monday reported that Pastor Dan Osato Osamwonyi, the Regional Overseer Mountain Of Fire And Miracles Ministries (MFM), Midwest Region 66, Benin City, who was abducted on May 25, 2021, is still missing 10 months after, giving the family a lot of concern.\n\nOsamwonyi was abducted on May 25, 2021, on his way to attend to a private issue. He was intercepted by some gunmen, who whisked him away from his Nissan SUV, into a getaway car and he has since remained incommunicado.\n\nThe Edo State Police Command that claimed to be on the trail of the abducted cleric, has not made any headway either, though, a suspect believed to be connected to the crime was arrested.\n\nHowever, a family member told SaharaReporters that the GO was informed about the incident but he called only once.\n\nSaharaReporters also obtained the audio of the conversation between Olukoya and the family on the incident.\n\nThe source affirmed that Olukoya asked them to go to God in prayers instead of wasting money during the only conversation that the family was able to have with him.\n\nThe family hinted that the suspect, one \u201cRobert Ukpong\u201d is also a member of MFM. They queried whether the G.O had bothered to have a one-on-one conversation with him to know why his name appeared on the text message from Pastor Daniel the day he (Daniel) was kidnapped.\n\nThe source said, \u201cDr D.K Olukoya was duly informed about the incident but he only called once. Calling him; he never picks up; as for texts and emails, he never responds. What was expected of the G.O was to be actively involved and go to any lengths to make sure his Regional Overseer pastor was found. But so far, no sign of that; the only time the family was able to reach the G.O on phone and even begged him to use his influence; he said, \u201cInstead of wasting money, the best is to go to God in prayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is really sad and painful because pastor Daniel Osamwonyi has done nothing but served MFM selflessly for the past 22 years, built churches in Expoma, Abuja and Benin and also bought a Prayer City for MFM in Benin City. Despite all the hate that has been thrown at him (I don\u2019t even want to go into the tribalism and nepotism) he continues to serve because he actually loves God and enjoys working wholeheartedly for him.\u201d\n\n\"The police and DSS keep lying that they can\u2019t track or trace pastor Daniel Osamwonyi\u2019s phone even after four months of his kidnap; but the children and some of the family members got a WhatsApp notification that Pastor Daniel left their WhatsApp group chat, but then DSS and police kept saying they can\u2019t track his phone because there\u2019s no network as the phone was turned off.\n\n\"The suspect \u2018Robert Ukpong\u2019 is also a member of MFM, has the G.O bothered having a one on one conversation with him to know why his name appeared on the text message from Pastor Daniel the day he was kidnapped?\n\n\"This is why we the family are crying out loud for the public to help us ask MFM to rise for Pastor Daniel Osamwonyi, the MFM Regional Overseer,\" the source added.",

          "text": "Kashifu Inuwa, director-general of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), says the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) failed three integrity tests.\n\nInuwa spoke to journalists on Wednesday after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the tests were meant to qualify UTAS \u2014 which was brought forward by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) \u2014 as an alternative payment platform to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).\n\nASUU has been on strike since February 14, and part of the reasons for the industrial action is that the federal government has refused to accept UTAS as a payment platform to replace the IPPIS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Inuwa said ASUU is currently reviewing the system.\n\n\u201cWhen we received the request to review UTAS, you know, building a complex system like UTAS that involves employees\u2019 personal data, and also payment system, we have to subject it to best practice tests before approving,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNormally, when we are reviewing that kind of system, we perform three tests. Firstly, because when you\u2019re building system, it\u2019s not just about the technology, you need to consider the people that will use this system and the process. You need to get the business requirement. What do you want to achieve? So, it\u2019s not the technology that will come first; it is the business requirement. Then, you need to identify the capabilities you need to achieve that your business objective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPart of the capability is the technology you need to bring in and the people that will operate the technology, because technology is always a tool that will help you to achieve an objective or to do your work. If you bring the tool before knowing what to do with it, it will be useless.\u201d\n\nHe said NITDA conducted a user acceptance test, a vulnerability test to check for possibility of hacking, and a stress test to prevent the system from crashing.\n\n\u201cWe did all these three tests with them and the system couldn\u2019t pass. We wrote the reports and submitted it back to the honourable minister, which he forwarded to all relevant institutions, including ASUU. As we speak now, ASUU is working, trying to fix all the issues we highlighted with the system and we will review it again. But that is just one half of the story,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second half of the story is that we need to find where to put that system like IPPIS. We have a data centre built for it. That means we need to have the data centre, and we need to check to make sure it meets minimum requirement, because if you put people\u2019s information and the system crashes, how can you pay them salary?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things to do. As we speak, they\u2019re trying to fix all the issues we highlighted with the system.\u201d",

          "title": "Why e-commerce is king in Egypt",
          "text": "When Syrian entrepreneur Ronaldo Mouchawar founded Souq.com in 2005, buying things by clicking a picture on a clunky computer was unheard of in the Middle East. Somehow, Souq managed to quickly become the leading online retailer in the Middle East. And in 2017, twelve years after it launched, Amazon bought it for $580 million to expand operations in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nToday Egyptian sales make up more than half of Souq\u2019s revenues.\n\nSouq\u2019s $580 million buyout underscored Amazon\u2019s online retail expectations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where e-commerce continues to grow at 25% every year. Bain and Company say the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Egypt, with its 103+ million residents, make up roughly 80% of the e-commerce market in the MENA region.\n\nFurthermore, a Disrupt Africa report released in January shows that 20% of Egyptian startups are decidedly pursuing opportunities in the e-commerce and retail-tech space. That is roughly two times the number of fintech startups operating in the country and a sharp contrast to the rest of the continent\u2019s startup profile. Last year, Egyptian e-commerce startups received USD$ 131.27 million; according to Africa: The Big Deal, which is 1.4 times the e-commerce funding Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa received in the same period.\n\nClearly, retail tech and e-commerce rule Egypt\u2019s tech scene; and this is why.\n\nGovernment policy is pushing informal SME retail online.\n\nFacing a budget deficit of $27.8 billion in May 2018, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered five-year tax exemptions while urging informal workers to legalise their status. The government had hoped to raise an additional $51.9 billion in taxes from the informal sector. At a parliamentary session, Mohamed Badrawi, a member of the Economic Affairs Committee, declared that \u201cIncorporating all these economic activities into the formal sector is becoming an urgent matter.\u201d\n\nThe informal sector in Egypt accounts for more than half of Egypt\u2019s economy. In 2020, the government issued a new law that offered incentives for small businesses to incorporate as formal entities. Beyond creating incentives for informal traders to formalise operations, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank imposed daily limits on cash deposits and withdrawals while asking banks to remove similar daily limits on digital transactions. The bank says this will help support financial inclusion goals. In reality, however, this push saw informal traders who generate bulk sales in cash struggle to deposit and withdraw cash, as a result, pushing them to formalise their businesses. When these traders incorporate and begin to accept digital transactions, it also makes sense to take their business online.\n\nA market scene in Cairo. Egypt\u2019s informal economy constitutes up to 50% of the country\u2019s GDP, provides more than 60% of new jobs and is growing by 1% every year.\n\nPhoto: Alex Azabache/Unsplash\n\nThe functioning belief on the part of the government was that e-commerce would aid a transition away from cash dependency, which will, in turn, reduce the size of the informal sector and increase tax revenue.\n\nCovid-related restrictions accelerated consumer trust in digital commerce channels.\n\nThe social and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation globally. Egypt was not an exception.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s best-strong-armed efforts (it mandated the use of cashless systems to pay for government services and imposed fines on defaulters), Egyptian shoppers remained reluctant to use digital channels for shopping or payments \u2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThis was also partly driven by the reforms mentioned earlier which the Egyptian government used to encourage informal retailers to formalise their operations. At the time, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank waived several bank transaction fees for 6 months which it later extended to the middle of 2021. As a result, despite predictions about slowing digital commerce growth in Egypt, Jumia and Noon reported a 940% increase in online sales as the pandemic hit. 72% of participants in a Mastercard survey claimed to have shopped online during the pandemic.\n\nThe trend appears to have sustained beyond COVID-19 as more people than ever use smartphones to access services. Today Egyptian e-commerce is expected to grow at least 30% this year, buoyed by younger shoppers and rising incomes from Egypt\u2019s expanding middle class.\n\nGood infrastructure is good business.\n\nAn omnibus whizzes past in Alexandria, Egypt. 74% of Egypt\u2019s 65,050km road network are paved more than double the continental average.\n\nPhoto: Fady Fouad/Unsplash\n\nAs e-commerce accelerated in Egypt, it created a ripple effect on the logistics sector. People who buy things online need to get their goods delivered somehow. While infrastructure in Egypt is not the best globally, Egyptian infrastructure is second only to that of the island nation of Seychelles on the Africa Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nA combination of a reasonably good road network and increased investment in transport and telecoms infrastructure is proving beneficial to the handful of logistics-tech startups that are helping to make shopping online easier.\n\nStill, as with online retail anywhere, last-mile logistics remains an issue. According to Waya Media, 40% of online orders in Egypt do not reach their customers the first time they are shipped. So while Egypt\u2019s 4000 post offices make up the backbone of its distribution network, a good number of online retailers who need to deliver items to their customers\u2019 doorsteps partner with full-service logistics companies or use smaller specialized delivery units that stitch together end-to-end services to patch delivery gaps.\n\nAggressive infrastructure investments by the Egyptian government has seen it rise to second place, only behind Seychelles on the African Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nSource: Open Data for Africa\n\nOther startups like Appetito are pioneering franchised pickup centres similar to what Getir does in Europe to bring grocery deliveries closer to their customers. More prominent players like Amazon opened a 28,000 square meter warehouse in the 10th of Ramadan City in August last year. The new hub and 15 delivery stations across Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Ismailia, and Assiut are part of Amazon\u2019s growing MENA distribution network.\n\nEgypt\u2019s last-mile delivery startups are the API connectors in a very fragmented supply chain. Image source: Wamda.\n\n\u201c[BNPL will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards\u201d \u2013 Sherif Nessim, Founding General Partner, Jedar Capital\n\nThe e-commerce boom is also creating ripple effects for fintech in Egypt. While cash-on-delivery is very much alive, the value of card transactions is growing at an impressive pace. The Egyptian central bank is playing a leading role in facilitating this shift. For example, it allows banks operating in the Egyptian market to own unlimited shares in payment service providers and payment systems operators as part of the country\u2019s push towards cashless payments.\n\nSherif Nessim, Founding General Partner at Jedar Capital, believes that Buy Now Pay Later offerings can help accelerate the transition to digital payments. \u201cEvery year, we find that the balance is moving from cash-on-delivery to cards, cash to cards. People are putting more trust in online payment methods,\u201d BNPL solutions, he adds, \u201c[will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards because if I pay with this credit card, I can pay in 6 months, interest-free.\u201d When you think about it, it makes sense for a market where younger and relatively more impulsive shoppers are the drivers of e-commerce growth.\n\nAccording to Nessim, all of these plays are part of why he expects growth to continue for traditional e-commerce and q-commerce companies.\n\nAttractive growth prospects lure VC money.\n\n2021 was a record-setting year for venture-backed companies globally. Venture capitalists invested more than USD$ 675 billion into startups globally, and Africa outdid its 2019 record with more than $5 billion invested in African startups. Venture funds were themselves swamped with cash, partly a fall out of fiscal (stimulus) policies for the pandemic and partly as a result of more people being willing to bet on risky \u201ccompanies of the future\u201d than ever before.\n\nAll of this activity has set the perfect stage for venture capital funds in Egypt. Last year and led by funding into e-commerce and retail tech companies, Egyptian startups raised $403.5 million, according to data from Disrupt Africa.\n\nWith more cash to spend, investor packs are hunting for growth and returns in emerging and frontier markets. Post-revolution Egypt happens to be one of the latest such frontier markets. Naturally, investors have their eyes on it. \u201cThey realise that the next ten years are the years for emerging and frontier markets,\u201d Sherif Nessim says. He adds that some VC firms he knows are creating dedicated funds \u201cthat only invest in emerging markets rather than invest out of their global funds.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, like Amazon and Souq illustrate, bigger growth-hungry companies in the United States and Europe prefer to acquire local companies in emerging markets instead of building from scratch.\n\nEgypt\u2019s unique combination of growing venture capital interest, growth prospects, and a government determined to shore up revenues by including more informal businesses means digital commerce will continue to grow as more retailers become formal and come online. At the same time, it also signals significant growth prospects for affordable business-to-business software and services to help these newly formal businesses manage their processes and access credit.\n\nCritics have slammed MENA investors for mostly backing e-commerce and marketplace startups. However, by helping buying and selling thrive online, those investments may be responsible for accelerating digital adoption in other areas in a region as conservative as the MENA. After all, since commerce is the backbone of the world\u2019s economic systems, it only makes sense for the digital version of the bazaars and souks that line Egyptian streets to lead the way for her technology ecosystem.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "As with most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, access to basic financial services is significantly limited in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just 14% of the population have an actual bank account and only 25% have an account with either banking or any other financial institution.\n\nMore so, there is less than 35 kilometre of paved road for every 1 million inhabitants in the French-speaking country, making traditional branch-based banking unfeasible for most of its 90 million residents and the bid for financial inclusion arduous.\n\nThe digital finance revolution that\u2019s played out in the rest of Africa over the past decade thus cannot come soon enough for people in the central African nation, especially given it has a 47% mobile phone penetration rate, with the figure likely to grow further.\n\nA number of startups have sprung up over the past 5 years, which, through fintech innovations, have brought financial services closer to where people live and work. One such is Flash International, the largest fintech and payments aggregator in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlash operates a network of agents that allows people to do their banking on its mobile platform (FlashApp), putting financial services\u2014including remittance, payments, and other value-added services\u2014within easy reach.\n\nThe startup currently has roughly 3,500 agents and 90 branches, through which it serves more than 2 million customers. And instead of opening individual accounts with multiple banks or mobile money operators, Flash gives its users a card with which they can accept all payments.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Johannesen, whose 25 years of professional experience cuts across roles in financial institutions like Citi and mobile finance firms Moneytrans and TigoCash, started the company in 2018.\n\nSince its launch, Flash has recorded stellar growth and is currently integrated with several banks, mobile money, and telecom operators. It claims to process nearly 1 million transactions valued at over $50 million per month through its payment services and also facilitates more than 40,000 satellite TV subscription transactions, one of its value-added products.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the mission was to build the first Congolese fintech that would aggregate as many financial and value-added services as possible. \u201cWhat we currently have is an application with up to 27 different products and services, through which thousands of agents make a living out of,\u201d Johannesen recalled in a recent interview with TechCabal.\n\nA screenshot of the Flash web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nUnlike Flash, Okapi Finance was launched out of Sweden by founder Gis\u00e8le Mwepu, with DRC being one of the company\u2019s four markets across all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The startup rolled out its services in the country last year and currently has 170,000 customers. Its goal, according to Mwepu, is to reach up to 25 million people in the country in less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cDRC has over 90 million people and still there aren\u2019t many financial services solutions available. The opportunity is very huge. And the unbanked people aren\u2019t just individuals, they can be traders, merchants, or informal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Okapi platform allows both individual and enterprise customers carry out daily financial transactions like deposits, money transfers, and salary disbursements through its web and mobile platforms, USSD, and physical agents.\n\nOkapi has a special focus on getting more women included in the country\u2019s financial services ecosystem. Per Mwepu, up to 80% of the company\u2019s DRC users and 95% of the 17,000 merchants it\u2019s onboarded are women. For the latter, the company extends a line of credit\u2014weekly loans of around $50\u2014to help power their businesses.\n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion cannot be achieved by only allowing people to carry out payment transactions,\u201d Mwepu noted. \u201cWe need to increase their accessibility to a wide array of financial services.\u201d\n\nThrough the Okapi platform, microfinance banks and insurance providers can distribute their products, enabling them penetrate the informal sector and reach the unbanked population. In addition, users don\u2019t need a bank account to access these services and after signing up can apply for the Okapi Visa card.\n\nA screenshot of the Okapi Finance web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nWhereas Flash focuses on urban areas like Kinshasa with most of its agents in DRC\u2019s major cities, Faysal Axam\u2019s startup targets the unbanked population in rural areas, where more than half of the population resides.\n\nIn Goma, the capital and business hub of North Kivu province in the eastern DRC, Faysal Company offers a \u201cTap and Pay\u201d solution\u2014a magnetic card that interacts with POS machines and interfaces with a virtual wallet.\n\n\u201cFinancial flows are mostly in DRC\u2019s urban areas, not so much in peri-urban areas, and nearly not at all in rural areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile mobile money penetration rate is 72% in cities, it\u2019s only 28% in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCircumventing fintech challenges in DRC\n\nIn a country like DRC where road and internet infrastructure is below par, agents are especially effective at reaching rural dwellers and reducing deployment costs for providers.\n\nFor customers, agent networks reduce travelling time and security risks as they historically had to locate one of the only 500 bank branches available in the country\u2014which is ironically Africa\u2019s second-largest country by land area and the fourth most populous.\n\n\u201cMost transactions are done over the counter in DRC as there\u2019s still a very low penetration in terms of smartphones and internet access is not affordable. Also, the prevalent habit of the population is mainly to visit an agent for a transaction or service,\u201d Johannesen said.\n\nA high capital barrier for entry in the financial services space preserves the dominance of big banks like Ecobank and UBA as well as network operators (such as Vodacom Congo, Orange RDC, and Bharti Airtel who collectively control 35-40 million subscribers).\n\nFintech startups looking to partner with banks and telcos have had to deal with skepticism and aversion from the industry giants. Axam recalled it took Faysal almost a year and a half to get its first mobile money integration license in 2020 after the startup was rebuffed by banks and local mobile network operators for partnerships.\n\nA screenshot of the Faysal Company web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nMultipay Congo, DRC\u2019s first inter-banking platform, was launched in 2015 to create interoperability between payment platforms like ATMs and point of sale machines.\n\nBut the framework doesn\u2019t make integrating with banks and telcos any easier for fintechs, according to Mwepu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to achieve financial inclusion without interoperability of solutions from other stakeholders like banks and telcos. We have to work together,\u201d the Okapi Finance founder said.\n\nOn the back of a successful partnership with Orange, Faysal\u2019s customer base has exceeded 10,000. Although that\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s significant nonetheless in a country where more than 70% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day and most have no immediate incentives to open financial accounts.\n\nAxam added that Faysal\u2019s growth is also because the solution can be used offline, even in areas without internet connectivity.\n\nWith internet access at around 17%, feature phones \u2013 which retail at about $20 \u2013 play a huge role in enabling Congolese to access digital finance services. Faysal, for instance, gets most of its traction from the USSD feature as Goma dwellers often must seek a mountaintop just to access 2G cell phone coverage.\n\nIn addition, while banks and telcos boast sufficient financial muscle to build and scale their products, startups lack access to sufficient finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t have finance, investors, incubators, and accelerators, especially in Goma,\u201d Axam said, citing security issues as a challenge that makes it hard for investors to trust the ecosystem. \u201cMany excellent solutions here can\u2019t get continental or international exposure because of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to note that the DRC\u2019s fintech landscape is practically nascent with only 12 startups playing in the space as of 2018, per a report from Microsave and MasterCard. But the digital finance seeds are clearly beginning to take root and there are concrete reasons to be bullish about the opportunities in DRC for fintech and its prospect to attract investors.\n\nWith startups like Flash, Okapi, Faysal, alongside remittance fintechs, partnerships like the Mastercard and Billetera deal targeting the millions of financially excluded residents, as well as the government\u2019s increasing shift towards virtual payments for its over thousands of civil servants, one can anticipate a radical digital finance expansion in the coming years as DRC moves to replicate other African countries\u2019 successes, slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cFintechs in DRC are beginning to thrive. It\u2019s definitely promising but a better infrastructural coverage is crucial to realising full potential,\u201d said Noel K. Tshiani founder of Congo Business Network, an international network of Congolese professionals and entrepreneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the vision of the DRC government under President Felix Tshisekedi and its ambitious digitisation program aligned with the country\u2019s National Digital Plan.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu met at a birthday party in Abuja, Nigeria, they knew they\u2019d make good friends; what they didn\u2019t know was, they would make good co-founders as well. But 8 years into their friendship, they have built and run a couple of projects and businesses together and, now, they are focused on building Pivo, a startup they envision will be the neobank for trade in Africa. Like AfreximBank but faster and digitally operated.\n\nThe big picture is to be the go-to neobank for trade in Africa by the end of this year, or next.\n\nPivo entered the market with Pivo Capital, a credit-focused financial services platform for supply chain small and medium businesses (SMEs), because of the co-founders\u2019 track record in the supply chain industry, especially the logistics aspect.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLong before Pivo, Amadi-Emina, a software engineer, worked as a tech consultant for Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for over 2 years. She left INEC in 2017 to found her first startup Jalo, a venture-backed on-demand delivery company that focused on Nigeria\u2019s North-Central market and served e-commerce platforms like Jumia and Konga in that region.\n\nIn August 2018, Amadi-Emina joined Kobo360 after the logistic startup acquired Jalo in an acquihire deal. She remained at Kobo360 for a little over 3 years before leaving last year to focus on Pivo.\n\nFor Akwiwu, a trained lawyer who claimed to have stumbled on tech by chance and the influence of friends like Amadi-Emina, her law career, which started officially in 2013, spanned across law firms and companies like Gilmor Engineering, one of the biggest engineering firms in Nigeria, where she worked for over 6 years.\n\nBut, along the line, she started playing with project and product management and operations, monitoring projects, and product development lifecycles on the side. Last year, she decided to transition fully into tech. She left law to focus on building Pivo and getting a master\u2019s degree in software development while at it.\n\nWith Amadi-Emina\u2019s experience in the logistics side of the supply chain, having worked and led the port operation effort at Kobo360, Akwiwu\u2019s experience in law, and their collective knowledge of running an exportation business, building a business that serves the logistics arm of the supply chain was a no-brainer.\n\nLogistics supply chain is Pivo\u2019s first stop\n\nIn Africa, access to credit is still one of the biggest challenges small businesses deal with, especially small supply chain businesses. Supply chain businesses usually have a short time to execute a contract, and due to the excessive bureaucracy and numerous requirements, acquiring credit from traditional financial institutions takes a long time, therefore these businesses are automatically at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is where Pivo comes in.\n\nA truck loading at the port. Image source: Lori\n\nLaunched in September last year, Pivo provides flexible and quick financing options for supply chain businesses like logistics service providers, clearing and forwarding businesses, and FMCG distributors. Pivo is like a third-party partner in a transaction between a buyer and a seller. But to understand what Pivo does, one must first understand how supply chain financing works.\n\nSupply chain finance is a type of cash advance suppliers receive from lenders to fulfill a transaction or contract before the buyer pays them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: a merchant wants to supply a buyer with goods but needs some working capital to see the transaction through before the buyer pays them. So the merchant approaches the lender (that would be Pivo, in this case) for a credit. The lender then collects all required information to check for the legitimacy of their transaction or contract claim with the buyer, then disburses the credit once the buyer confirms the contract.\n\nThe above illustration explains Pivo at its core. Once a business finishes their KYC and asks for credit, Pivo prompts them to supply all the information about the transaction they need financing for. After that, Pivo profiles the business seeking credit for worthiness, runs a risk assessment on the transaction, and then profiles the businesses they are doing the transaction with, to ascertain whether they are credible and good for the money.\n\nOnce everything checks out and the buyer agrees to pay into the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, Pivo then disburses the loan. In partnership with Providus Bank, Pivo provides its customers with a business account that facilitates remittance. So, after the money lands in the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, the startup takes its dues.\n\nAll these checks and assessments help Pivo to finance only creditworthy customers and less-risky transactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to ensure 98% recovery on every single capital we deploy to our customers,\u201d Amadi-Emina told TechCabal.\n\nAmadi-Emina also mentioned that the average capital requests they\u2019ve received per customer is about $10,000. And while they cater for credits within the range of $5,000 from the company\u2019s balance sheet, requests above $5,000 are passed to their credit partners.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nFor now, the startup is still building in a stealth mode and according to the CEO Amadi-Emina, Pivo currently has about 250 direct SMEs customers and 5 ecosystem leads, which are the larger corporations that Pivo serve the SMEs within their value chain through embedded finance. Each ecosystem lead is reported to have about 500 to 1,000 SMEs.\n\nThe startup lists some of the top logistic companies in Africa as its ecosystem lead customers including Jetstream Africa, SabiRoad, Vee Logistics, and MVx.\n\nOn the side of its loan book, the co-founders said they have disbursed $1 million worth of credit out of over $2 million worth of applications that they have received since launch.\n\nThe company makes money from the interest charged on the credit disbursed, management fees, and the one-off charges from account creation. Akwiwu believes that as they continue to add more offerings, they will have more sources of revenue.\n\nThe startup has also raised a 6-figure preseed from Microtraction, FirstCheck Africa, Ventures Platform, Mercy Corps Venture, Rally Cap Ventures, Metis Capital Partner, Bold Angel Fund, and recently just got into the ODX accelerator programme where it\u2019s entitled to $125,000 for a 7% equity stake.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFor Akwiwu and Amadi-Emma, the roadmap is clear and they already have new products that will help them become a full-fledged neobank for trade in the works. For example, products like Invoice Factoring and Pivo Plus, which includes insurance and corporate compliance offerings, are already in the testing phase.\n\nThe company is currently only operational in Nigeria with the plan to expand into Ghana before the end of the year.\n\nThe competition in the credit market in Africa is heating up and it\u2019s good for SMEs. While there are new upstarts springing up to provide credit for businesses, the bigger ones are also making a fray into the scene. For instance, Flutterwave, the unicorn fintech, has joined the credit space with the recent announcement of Flutterwave Capital.\n\nWhile other startups like Payhippo, Lendigo, Float, and even Brass have successfully built a digital financial institution that provides credit for African SMEs, Pivo is the only one playing strictly in the supply chain sector, at least that we know of at the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The total worth of disbursed credit has been changed from $980,000 to $1 million. Between the time we interviewed the founders and the date this article was published, Pivo disbursed another $20,000 in credit.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Togolese inventor builds $12,000 mini tractors for the West African market",
          "text": "First, he received awards for inventing the \u201cFoufoumix\u201d, which brings relief from hours spent pounding foufou. Then, Minsob Logou invented a mini-tractor, tailor-made for local conditions. Now, he wants to sell it across the region.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Blame Ekoue of bird story agency.\n\nSeeing imported agricultural machinery \u2013 often paid for by government or donors \u2013 lying discarded due to the unavailability of local servicing or parts was enough for Minsob Logou to invest his time, money, and energy into a local solution for farmers. The result: the Logoutrac mini-tractor. It\u2019s a step out of the kitchen and into the field for this award-winning Togolese inventor.\n\nBetter known in Togo and the region as the \u201cfather of Foufoumix\u201d Logou requires little introduction to those who keep an eye on the world of African invention. As early as 2002, Logou was honoured for his work by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in 2014, he placed second at the African Innovation Awards. His desire to invent is deep-seated.\n\n\u201cThe story started from a passion that I had from an early age for all things related to technology. Since the benches of the school, I had this thing in me for all that is technological. I have to try to see how they were designed, how we arrive at what we design can respond to a given functionality. This is what gave me all this knowledge today, which far exceeds what I learned on the benches,\u201d Logou explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBorn into a large family, his position as an engineer at Togo Telecom, though coveted, was not enough to stop the inventor from resigning to devote himself to finding solutions full time. His first big win came with an invention that allows cooks at home and in restaurants to replace hours of strenuous work \u2013 the Foufoumix. The industrial-looking kitchen unit has been a hit in West Africa to such an extent that knock-offs are now produced in China. Logou tries to provide local solutions to local problems.\n\n\u201cThe basis of my research to be able to create a product is the observation of my community. When I see that they are in need of something, I can create machinery to make it easier for them to obtain a result in order to improve performance and make their lives better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was the thinking behind his latest invention, launched recently at his small factory located on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9. Logou describes his mini-tractor \u2013 which sports the \u201cLogoutrac\u201d brand \u2013 as a \u2018made-in-Togo mini-tractor, a versatile, powerful, and resilient machine\u2019.\n\nThe prototype for the tractor, which retails for the local equivalent of $12,000, was built using salvaged parts, with the idea that doing so would help buyers easily access spare parts. But due to high initial demand, the young Togolese engineer quickly took the next step.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay in recovery or recycling anymore and I am now manufacturing some of the spare parts of this machinery myself,\u201d he explained.\n\nLogou said that the initial idea for the mini-tractor came from his frustration at seeing the vast amounts of money that are used to purchase foreign agricultural machinery, only for it to be abandoned because spare parts are too difficult to too expensive to purchase locally.\n\n\u201cThe solutions that we import from elsewhere, most of the time, fail to meet our needs. So we end up with problems in agricultural mechanisation. Big tractors don\u2019t last long in the field before they break down. And when they stall, first, the expertise to detect the breakdown is a problem and the same spare part must be ordered from the parent company, which is quite complicated,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe $12,000-mini tractors built by Minsob Logou. Image credit: bird story agency.\n\nSelling at 7 million FCFA (the equivalent of around $12,000), the mini-tractors are built for a regional market as well as a local one. That is why Lougou is looking carefully at the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Togo is a signatory \u2013 and which should help him sell his inventions across Africa. Currently, there are trade barriers in place which prevent significant exports.\n\n\u201cPeople are showing interest but so far, there has been no international export. We should do it but the problem is free trade between African countries,\u201d fumed Logou.\n\nCurrently, Logoutrac equipment is sold by agricultural groups and the Togolese Ministry of Agriculture. A lower-cost option is already in the works.\n\n\u201cSince the cost is not within the reach of all farmers, we are working on a tiller for those who cannot afford it,\u201d Lougou explained.\n\nLogou\u2019s other pet project is finding solutions to a far wider problem: counterfeiting. While counterfeiting is estimated at 10% worldwide, it reaches 30 to 80% of products sold in Africa, depending on the sector. He has good reason to want to bring an end to counterfeits, especially of his Foufoumix product.\n\n\u201cThere are Chinese choppers that our compatriots import to sell and announce that it is foufoumix, but the latter is a registered trademark which has a patent\u2026 Having had trials in this direction, the conclusion that I have drawn is that our justices in West Africa are not strong enough in the field of intellectual property. There is still a lot to be done,\u201d he says, adding that he has brought counterfeiters to justice but nothing has come out of it.\n\nTo deal with this problem, he prefers to focus instead on the quality of his products.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is to have quality products,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "After verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya, OkHi secures $1.5 million to expand across Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart-addressing startup, OkHi has announced a seed extension round of $1.5 million after a seed round of the same amount in 2020. Following the close of this seed round, the startup is set to focus on onboarding more institutions as it works towards having one million verified addresses in its database by 2022.\n\nThis round had new and existing investors such as Founders Factory Africa, Betatron, Interswitch, Chapel Hill Denham, and Flutterwave executives; other investors include EXFI (a syndicate of ex-Google employees) and Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nSince the 1960s, when much of Africa gained independence, the urbanisation rate has grown rapidly. At the time of gaining independence, 80% of the population lived in rural areas. However, that figure currently stands at 50% and keeps growing annually.\n\nThis growth has been accompanied by the challenge of a proper addressing system for the continent. According to the United Nations, about 400 million of the 4 billion people who have no addresses live in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of a proper addressing system presents governments, service providers, and residents with numerous problems. For example, how is an eCommerce business supposed to deliver an order to the correct location without a reliable method of verifying a customer\u2019s address?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder and CEO of OkHi, Timbo Drayson\n\nUnsurprisingly, this challenge results in businesses losing tons of money while lives are lost because essential services providers can\u2019t reach their locations.\n\nIn Nigeria, anyone opening a bank account has to submit documentation for address verification. For most people, this is a utility bill. A human agent deployed by the bank then steps out to verify the address on the utility bill supplied by the prospective customer. Apparently, this method is inefficient and unreliable as some people may not have a valid utility bill and would have to use utility bills that do not belong to them.\n\nWhile travelling across Africa in 2014, Timbo Drayson, an ex-Googler, discovered that Google Maps did not work perfectly in Africa. With this realisation, he built OkHi in Kenya to provide address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.\n\nWhile there have been solutions such as Google\u2019s \u201cPlus Codes,\u201d OkHi\u2019s solution is different because it focuses on addressing people and not locations.\n\nVerifying one million addresses\n\nIn December 2020, the startup launched in Nigeria after reportedly verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya. This launch also saw it partner with fintech giant, Interswitch, which doubles as an investor. Drayson explained the reason for this move on a call with Techpoint Africa.\n\n\u201cWe showed some amazing success in Kenya where we were focused on solving the addressing problem for delivery businesses, and we showed great traction. However, the goal and the vision of OkHi has always remained the same, which is to enable half the world who don\u2019t have a physical address to be included.\n\n\u201cA great use case for that is address verification and being able to use your address to help onboard financial services. What we found when we tried to approach this in Kenya was that it wasn\u2019t the best place to basically build and go to market with address verification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike Nigeria, Kenya has a vast mobile money market dominated by Safaricom and M-Pesa. Consequently, fintech startups cannot generate as much traction as their Nigerian counterparts. A meeting with Interswitch was also a significant factor in the startup\u2019s decision to move to Nigeria.\n\nWith broad coverage of the Nigerian market, Interswitch offers the startup the opportunity to tap into its vast network of financial institutions. In October 2021, OkHi announced a partnership with Quickteller that enables its customers to verify their addresses digitally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s great about Interswitch is essentially that they already serve our target user base, which is both consumers that need to have verified addresses and the banks and fintechs that need to use it,\u201d Drayson stated.\n\nIn addition to Quickteller, OkHi is running a pilot program with Stanbic IBTC Bank \u2014 a Nigerian commercial bank \u2014 that enables the bank\u2019s customers to verify their addresses digitally. Based on this partnership, Drayson noted that in addition to being more accurate, OkHi\u2019s solution is four times faster than human agents and can be done at half the cost.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a very rich pipeline of customers, both banks and fintechs that are currently integrating or going live in pilot. Our focus is just to execute on that and make sure that by 2022, we have about a million people using OkHi and verifying their addresses with us.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing users with a digitally verifiable address, the startup\u2019s solution can notify businesses when a user changes their address. To do this, it makes use of data from their smartphone.\n\nSuch technology could create privacy concerns for users, and Drayson revealed that it allows users to opt out of using the solution whenever they like. In addition, they also adhere to the guidelines stipulated by the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).\n\nBreaking down OkHi\u2019s business model\n\nAddress verification can be broken down into three major categories: collecting an accurate address, verifying the address, and delivering to the address.\n\nOkHi has three products \u2014 OkCollect, OkVerify, and OkGo \u2014 covering these functions. OkCollect uses a photo and GPS to verify addresses; OkVerify uses data from a customer\u2019s phone, while OkGo serves as a Google Maps of sorts, enabling anyone to navigate OkHi addresses.\n\nWhile customers can use their OkHi addresses for free, OkHi charges businesses \u20a6500 (~$1) every time they verify a customer\u2019s address using OkHi. Although other startups provide verification services in Nigeria, most focus on document and identity verification.\n\n\u201cWhile there are a number of identity verification players who do document and biometric verification, for example, Smile Identity, most of them are more potential partners than competitors because while they offer full digital KYC solutions to businesses, they do not provide digital address verification. Therefore, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to power their address verification digitally,\u201d Drayson told Techpoint Africa.\n\nBuilding as pioneers\n\nBuilding a business comes with unique challenges, and Drayson shares that most of their challenges come with playing in a new space with no blueprint to follow. Consequently, they have had to convince investors and customers alike of the merits of their solution.\n\n\u201cAs a new business and technology that the world has never seen before, we have had to work hard to earn the trust of our early adopters, who are the pioneers taking our solution to market.\n\n\u201cWhile we have raised over $4m in total to date, and of course, there is still a lot of learning along the way; ultimately, we\u2019re inventing a new category of business here. It\u2019s an untrodden path with no proof points anywhere in the world, so it\u2019s just been perseverance to close the investors we have today, who I\u2019m thankful to for their money and advice.\u201d\n\nWhile the focus is currently on financial institutions, there are plans to start offering services to other sectors such as food delivery, ride-hailing, and eCommerce in 2022. Having tried and succeeded in Kenya, the startup would be in familiar territory if that were to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan first built Ozi in 2019, there were many things they didn\u2019t consider would be big problems; one of them was finding a good developer to build a product.\n\nBut after spending March through May 2021 trying to find one to build their product, they decided it was time to find a different solution. Azeez had heard of no-code tools, and they decided to research whether it would be a good fit.\n\nWithin a week, the verdict was in. Like bloodhounds, they picked up the trail to a helpful solution. They found no-code tools like Bubble, Airtable, Adalo, Webflow, Zapier and more. By August 2021, Akpan and Azeez had launched the beta version of Ozi, testing it on their eight loyal customers.\n\nA welcome surprise for someone with a previously condescending view of all things no-code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey made everything easy so anyone with zero knowledge can use it. Before I dived into building anything with them, I was looking down on them, saying you can\u2019t achieve anything with them because they will just give you templates to develop stuff with. But you can achieve complex workflows; you can connect with APIs,\u201d Azeez said.\n\nThe making of Ozi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsteam on pot in kitchen\n\nPeople take different roads to entrepreneurship, but for Azeez and Akpan, it began in the University of Lagos (UNILAG) in 2017 and with a platform called Lagviews.\n\nLagviews was a platform the duo ran as a directory to help students find \u201centrepreneurs on campus.\u201d They built the website using low-code tool, WordPress but soon discovered a glitch in their plan. People would rather contact them on WhatsApp than use the website.\n\nSoon, they pretty much conducted all their business on the messaging platform and turned into a WhatsApp TV, helping businesses advertise on their statuses for \u20a6500 or \u20a61,000. But they couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nThey had classes and could not always respond to enquiries, so they decided to create a chatbot. A stroke of genius \u2014 or luck \u2014 that led to the first client of what would eventually become Ozi.\n\n\u201cWhen we did it, we got a contact from a church. They saw the chatbot, and they liked it. The church was Joshuaville, the youth church of the City of David. They asked if we could do this chatbot for them, and we said sure, we could do it. We did it for the church, and they liked it.\n\n\u201cBut it got to where, apart from the chatbot, they also wanted to push out their messages to their members. They asked if we could do bulk messages for the platform instead of just chatbot. So, it took us a few tries. I got a few of my friends in the computer sciences department, and we came up with a solution that could also help the church send bulk messages to their people.\u201d\n\nThe solution: the church sends the numbers to them, and they manually send all the messages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the rest is history, or should we say \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d\n\nMore roadblocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith one customer, things were pretty straightforward. Send broadcast messages and respond to any enquiries with a chatbot. They basically acted as an agent for the church, but for its WhatsApp needs.\n\nBut from one, it grew to eight, based on referrals and a little word of mouth. And with more customers came more responsibilities and complexities.\n\nThey landed a contract with The Elevation Church, and a referral by the church led them to work with Lekki County Homes.\n\nCustomers wanted to find out whether contacts were going to be sold or compromised, and so, they had to sign non-disclosure agreements. But this solution could not become a one-size-fits-all, and they lost potential customers. And so began the search for developers and the journey to no-code.\n\nWhat does Ozi do?\n\nOzi is best described as a Communications as a Service product.\n\nSelf-styled Ozi, the first WhatsApp automation platform in Nigeria, helps users automate their messages on several messaging platforms. You can send and schedule campaigns, appoint agents to reply to messages, create your chatbot, and create mailing lists or groups to send newsletters to on your messaging platforms, among other things.\n\nYou also get delivery reports to measure conversion rates.\n\nSign up is pretty seamless and involves entering your email and password or connecting using Facebook or Google. You then go to a page to fill in your number before preceding to your dashboard.\n\nCurrently, you can connect your WhatsApp account on your dashboard, but according to Azeez, other messaging platforms like Telegram and Instagram are only done on request.\n\nAs part of the company\u2019s nod to data privacy complaints by customers, it has a privacy policy and is working to become fully NDPR compliant by the end of March 2022.\n\nWhy WhatsApp?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game plan, Azeez told me, is to become the number one platform people think of for their business messaging needs on WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cWe have a future target that we are trying to drive the products towards. We are trying to create a product that does customer relations for businesses, and that\u2019s where we are building the product towards \u2014 a CRM for messaging apps.\u201d\n\nUnlike competitors like Termii and Sendchamp, which focus on unified communications via channels like SMS, email, and other messaging platforms, Ozi has doubled down on its WhatsApp strategy.\n\nThe reason? Open rates.\n\nAccording to Mailchimp, the average open rate for all industries using email is 21.33%. Azeez promises a 98% open rate on WhatsApp using Ozi.\n\nThe other reason is to save costs for businesses.\n\n\u201cWe understand the problem, and it\u2019s helping people save the cost of SMS. SMS is expensive, and people communicate more on messaging apps, so they don\u2019t have to spend on airtime.\n\n\u201cIf people reach their audience, their customers at large, in bulk, via WhatsApp, it\u2019s going to save them money. And it\u2019s also going to save time because of the automation we have.\u201d\n\nFor context, the cost of sending bulk messages via SMS varies. Some platforms cost \u20a61.99 per unit, while others cost \u20a61.90. To send messages to 2,000 contacts at \u20a61.90 per unit, you\u2019ll spend \u20a63,800. If you send messages at least four times a week, that equates to \u20a660,800.\n\nOn Ozi, to send messages to a maximum of 5,000 contacts, you\u2019ll spend \u20a620,000 a month, while sending to 10,000 numbers will cost you \u20a630,000. All of this comes with agents, chatbots, and other add-ons.\n\nYou also have the option to use the pay-as-you-go service at \u20a60.50k per message and fewer add-ons.\n\nAnd then, there is the argument of higher open rates leading to more conversion.\n\nBut a focus on WhatsApp alienates potential customers for other services like email and SMS.\n\n\u201cWe even had a disagreement with one of our customers who was like, \u201870% of my members are not on WhatsApp.\u2019 I was like it was not possible. He was not even saying 30%. While I know everyone is not on WhatsApp, more people are using WhatsApp these days.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, according to Statista, WhatsApp\u2019s user base in Nigeria was approximately 4.03 million users and was projected to reach 8.13 million users by 2025.\n\nBut Azeez says this is part of a strategy: corner the WhatsApp market first and introduce other channels later. A very interesting gamble.\n\nWhat makes Ozi different?\n\nThe answer: the ability to send bulk WhatsApp messages\n\n\u201cWhat makes our product stand out is that if you use Termii, for instance, and you want to connect messaging channels like WhatsApp and Facebook, you have to go through WhatsApp\u2019s API.\n\n\u201cSo basically, you go to Termii, and you sign up on their website, then if you want to add your WhatsApp messaging channel, you apply for it. Termii then forwards your application to WhatsApp for approval. But with us, you don\u2019t need all that.\u201d\n\nAzeez says this makes the process cumbersome and prevents users from sending bulk messages. Usually, users can send broadcast messages, but that has a limit of 256 contacts.\n\nThe team found a way to bypass this using a chatbot that essentially copies and pastes the message to each contact. To send messages to 900 contacts takes an hour.\n\nPossible policy questions\n\nIn 2019, WhatsApp introduced a policy that prevents the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging. The rationale was to prevent users from getting unwanted messages from strangers and encouraged them to report and block such numbers.\n\nIt also threatened legal action against persons or businesses who violated this policy.\n\nAccording to Azeez, Ozi frowns on spamming and rarely allows marketers to use the platform. He also said that the way the product is set up \u2014 a chatbot copying and pasting the messages \u2014 prevents it from facing trouble with the messaging app.\n\nHowever, according to WhatsApp\u2019s white paper, it has ways of determining automation, like the \u201ctyping\u2026\u201d signal it shows whenever a human is typing. It says bots cannot do this. But this white paper is four years old, and thse company might have improved its programming.\n\nIt, however, raises a red flag as to how well this policy is being implemented.\n\nBecoming no-code advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I spoke to Azeez, his infectious enthusiasm for no-code was on full display.\n\nNo-code tools allow anyone to build web and mobile apps without writing a line of code. To Akpan and Azeez, economics graduates with very little knowledge of programming languages, this was a godsend.\n\nAzeez plans to set up a no-code platform to propagate the gospel of no-code and train no-code professionals to meet the rising global need for their services.\n\n\u201cThere are people looking for no-code talents. I feel that for people who are already using Adsense or WordPress, no-code is what they should go to next because the market is big.\u201d\n\nHe also advises entrepreneurs to go the route of no-code to validate their ideas and ensure there\u2019s a market before rushing to build with code.\n\n\u201cFor starting up, go through no-code. You\u2019ll use it to learn about what your product needs before you invest in actual coding to develop your products.\u201d\n\nBut he also cautions on the cost of no-code. While there are free plans, you would need to pay for more storage as the platform grows; this phenomenon is not uncommon as low-code platforms like WordPress work similarly.\n\nOn Bubble, a personal plan costs $25 per month and comes with 10GB of space, a custom domain, email support, etc. A professional plan costs $115 per month, with more space and other add-ons. The production plan costs $475 per month, with dedicated cloud storage and more benefits.\n\nBest laid plans coming together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first spoke to Azeez in November 2021, through spotty Internet connections and turned-off videos, he told me many things that Ozi planned to achieve with timelines.\n\nThey planned to hire more people to focus on marketing and sales. At the 1,000 customer mark, there were also plans to raise funding by the end of the first quarter of 2022, reduce pricing and business margin, and increase active users to 10,000 by the second half of 2022.\n\nWhen we spoke this week, he could confirm that all but one had been achieved.\n\nThe startup has just closed a $10,000 angel round, with an increase from 100 to 10,000 users \u2014 2,000 active \u2014 a business margin of 90% cost and 10% profit, up from a previous 95%, and a five-person team, including a digital marketer and a content creator.\n\nThe company also reduced pricing from \u20a620,000 for 2,000 \u2013 5,000 contacts and \u20a630,000 for 5,000 contacts to \u20a620,000 for 5,000 contacts and \u20a630,000 for 10,000 contacts.\n\nAzeez said the funds would be used to improve data privacy while doubling down on marketing and sales.\n\nAll this leads Ozi to its end goal of becoming the one-stop shop for unified communication in Africa. But then, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At Techpoint, we published a piece filled with funding tips for female entrepreneurs.\n\nOne thing bears repeating: women are underrepresented in most organisations and settings. Like most problems, there is no single cause or solution to this. However, in your little way, you can help build a more equal world.\n\nHere\u2019s the article I spoke about. Please read and share it with the women in your circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re discussing today:\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s spectrum auction\n\nBitmama\u2019s physical cards\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s spectrum auction begins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA telecom tower\n\nAfter more than a decade, South Africa\u2019s spectrum auction is about to commence. On the first day, Rain and Telkom emerged winners, forking out a combined R2.6 billion ($169.8 million).\n\nWhile Telkom paid R1.5 billion ($98 million) for two chunks of 10MHz in the 800MHz band, Rain paid R1.1 billion ($71.8 million) for its bands. The auction is expected to resume on Thursday where all qualified companies will participate in the main auction.\n\nOn the sidelines of the auction is a court case filed by Telkom against the bidding process. The company alleges that the bidding process will harm competition in the telecommunications sector.\n\nThe company had previously asked the court to supervise a new auction to be conducted by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) once it invalidates the current auction. ICASA, on the other hand, has said there is no legal impediment to the auction proceeding.\n\nBitmama launches physical cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Flickr\n\nOver the last few years, Nigerian banks have reduced the spending limit of customers\u2019 dollar debit cards. Consequently, customers have frequently complained about their inability to complete transactions while outside the country.\n\nIn response, one of the foremost cryptocurrency startups in the country, Bitmama, has launched physical cards. This is coming three months after it launched virtual cards for its users. In a blog post announcing it, the company revealed that there is no minimum deposit required, making the card available to new and old users alike.\n\nThe card can be funded with stable coins like USDT and USDC, with a monthly spending limit of over $10,000. Additionally, users can use it on PoS terminals or for online payments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the surface, this is an interesting development that solves the challenge of FX limits for Nigerians travelling abroad. However, with cryptocurrencies not yet accepted by many businesses globally, one may wonder how it will work. Typically, crypto debit cards automatically convert cryptocurrencies at the point of transacting to fiat and Bitmama\u2019s card may work similarly. However, it is unclear if it will work in the same way for ATM withdrawals.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Businesses suffer as diesel price surges 160%",
          "text": "Like many business owners across Nigeria, Joseph Martins, who plies his trade in the country\u2019s commercial capital, Lagos, depends largely on diesel. But buying the diesel he needs to power his generator has been giving him a big headache in recent weeks because of the skyrocketing cost of the fuel.\n\nUnable to depend on the national grid for stable power supply and finding it hard to push the cost down to the final consumers, he is forced to buy a litre of diesel for over N500 per litre and that squeezes his tiny profit margin even further.\n\nThe price of Automotive Gas Oil, popularly known as diesel, has soared by almost 160 per cent in one year to N540-570 per litre from N220-N240 in March last year.\n\n\u201cAt the current pace, any business using diesel will be forced to increase its price which will have an effect on inflation rate,\u201d Martins told BusinessDay.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, followed the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Brent, the global oil benchmark, jumped a 13-year high of $139 per barrel on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe marketers are selling at a price that covers their cost price, import cost and exchange rate price,\u201d said Mike Osatuyi, national operations controller of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur selling price is based on the crude price and the cost of dollars in the black market which is N575 because marketers source dollars from the black market.\u201d\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country, most small businesses, manufacturers or retailers are now facing intense pressure from rising energy costs as they have to spend more on diesel to power their generators.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 4,033.7MW as 6am on Tuesday, according to data from the Nigerian Electricity System Operator.\n\nBusiness experts have expressed fear that the spike in diesel price might force more businesses to sack employees amid rising energy costs.\n\nThe immediate past director-general of Nigeria\u2019s largest business think-tank, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Muda Yusuf, said high and increasing cost of diesel was compounding an already difficult situation for many investors.\n\n\u201cWe would see an escalation in production and operating costs; mounting inflationary pressures, erosion of profit margins, and a risk to business continuity, especially for SMEs in the real sector,\u201d Yusuf, CEO of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, added.\n\nDiesel is mostly used by businesses, especially manufacturers, to power their generators amid a lack of reliable power supply from the national grid. Many vehicles transporting goods and people across the country also use diesel.\n\n\u201cHigh diesel cost would trigger higher transportation costs. Most haulage vehicles are powered by diesel. Increase in transport costs typically impacts on general price level,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cA major driver of inflation is high transportation costs.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nigeria diesel generator market to hit $806.8m by 2030-report\n\nMichael Adebayo, chairman of Gas Users Group at Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, said manufacturers \u201care currently in a fix as they have to deal with rising production cost, reduced demand and their inability to increase the prices of goods.\u201d\n\nAdebayo, a director at Haffar Industrial Company Limited, a textile production company, described the spike in diesel price in the first quarter of the year as a bad omen for the 2022 business year.\n\n\u201cCurrently this is a time of confusion for us because we do not even know the best way to address this, especially as the price increase is continuous,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria ranked 169 in the getting electricity metric, scoring 47.4 points on the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business 2020 report and a zero in the reliability of power supply. Local manufacturers are left to self-generate more than 8,000 megawatts through alternative sources of energy in order to stay afloat, which sees them spending so much on petrol and diesel.\n\n\u201cIt is only a matter of time before the prices of other goods and services go up,\u201d Adebayo told BusinessDay.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that the average diesel price in Lagos was N303 in January 2022, a 24 percent rise when compared to the price of N243 in December.\n\nThe NBS data also showed that diesel price was N131.47 in June 2015 when the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration came into power.\n\nThe NBS, in a power sector data review, revealed that generators (diesel, petrol and gas) provide 48.6 percent of the electricity consumed by both households and businesses across the country.\n\n\u201cThis means that the country\u2019s electricity sector is fast becoming degenerate as 12 in every 25 Nigerians make use of generators, spending about $16 million to fuel only 14 million of these generators annually,\u201d Financial Derivatives Company Limited said in a new report.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026blames Edo Assembly crisis on lack of women representation\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has linked the crisis that rocked the state\u2019s House of Assembly to the lack of women representation in the House, reassuring support for more representation in elective positions.\n\nObaseki gave the assurance during an event at the Government House, Benin City, to mark this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMy only regret till date is that I didn\u2019t work hard enough during the last national elections that produced members of our State House of Assembly to bring women into the House.\n\n\u201cYou all know the situation under which we conducted that election. And we can see the crisis that we had in the House. It was possible because we did not have a woman there.\n\n\u201cSo, we have learned our lesson, and this election, you don\u2019t need to preach to us. I will go out there to campaign and more women will be elected into our State House of Assembly. The crisis we had may have been avoided if we have more voices of reasoning in that House.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, women get ready. You know how we do it; you know we moved from ward to ward, and will do that again in a few months\u2019 time. Rest assured that our government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow you to achieve your goals,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe governor, who flayed the National Assembly for rejecting bills seeking affirmative action and inclusion of women in politics and other spheres of the society, noted that \u201cthe action of the National Assembly should serve as a turning point in our history and should spur you, women, to mobilize Nigerians for gender equality and to break the bias; do not despair.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cToday\u2019s celebration would have been an epic one if the National Assembly had set aside all unfounded misgivings and biases to justify their refusal to constructive debates and approved the bills to alter the provisions of our constitution to provide affirmative action for women in our political administration and other related matters.\n\n\u201cIf they had done the right thing, today, we would have all rolled out the drums to celebrate them for such resolute display of progressive change, but unfortunately, they refused. Rather, today, we are all going to carry placards across the country to commence protest which will force those we voted to represent our interests to do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only leaders understand and appreciate the exceptional competence and leadership abilities of women, there will be no conversation about giving women the opportunity and responsibility in government,\u201d the governor added.\n\nSpeaking on efforts to end all forms of gender bias in Edo, Obaseki said, \u201cIn Edo, we are clear. We have seen how women have contributed to making major differences in our lives. If we say we want to make Edo great again, then, the women must be at the forefront.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Besty Obaseki, who was represented by the wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Maryann Shaibu, also berated the National Assembly for not giving approval to the five gender bills.\n\nIn her opening remarks, the Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, Mrs. Maria Edeko commended Obaseki and the Edo State House of Assembly for showing support for women as evidenced by the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Law.\n\nThe Commissioner noted, \u201cThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is a call on political leaders to show support for women so that a large number of them would be elected as state and national assembly members.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, on Wednesday, apologized to the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) over some uncomplimentary remarks he made against justice Inyang Ekwo, the Abuja High Court judge who ordered his removal as governor.\n\nUmahi, who has appealed the court decision, apologised while addressing members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who held solidarity rally for him at the Udensi Rundabout, Abakaliki.\n\nThe NBA had in a statement by its president, Olumide Akpata earlier on Wednesday, berated Umahi for attacking the judge and demanded an apology from him.\n\nSpeaking at the rally, Umahi said that he has mobilized over seventeen (17) SANs to Appeal the judgement wherein he was sacked for defecting from the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the ruling APC.\n\nHe noted that he has no regrets in defecting to the ruling APC and threatened to engage in battle with the opposition party in Ebonyi State, especially for trying to distract his administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still the governor of Ebonyi state and I\u2019m still working. I said the lawyers of PDP are the ones doing forum shopping and I\u2019m going to write against the lawyers to NBA to discipline them because the judge was misled. The blame was not on the judge. The blame is on the PDP lawyers who misled the judge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m using the opportunity to let Nigerians know that nobody castigated the judge and we will not and because the matter was not before any judge.\n\n\u201cToday, we have appealed the judgement. We have done three things; we have done the appeal at Enugu, and when I say that, we have two judgements, I say that the judgement in Ebonyi state, which has equal powers with that of Abuja. We said we will obey the judgement in Ebonyi state. We will appeal the judgement of Abuja. We didn\u2019t say we will disobey otherwise we would have not appealed.\n\n\u201cWe are before the Appeal of Enugu state and that of Abuja. We have also filed a stay of execution. So, we are still the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi state\u201d he stated\n\nRecall that NBA in the said statement by its president Akpata earlier on Wednesday, said the governor\u2019s remarks, during a press conference in Abakaliki during which he described the court decision against him as \u201cjungle justice\u201d and Justice Inyang Ekwo, who delivered same as \u201ca hatchet man,\u201d while maintaining that he would not obey the order, were totally unacceptable.\n\nAkpata noted that Umahi was expected to have called for calm from his supporters and assured them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the judgment but instead gave such a response.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has noted with utter dismay, the unfortunate and totally unacceptable reaction of His Excellency, Dave Umahi to the Judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja delivered on 8th March 2022, coram Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo which inter-alia ordered him and H.E. Mr. Eric Kelechi Igwe to vacate the offices of Governor and Deputy Governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State on grounds of their defection from the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress,\u201d the NBA statement had said.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Judgment, Umahi, in the course of a Press Conference \u2013 video evidence of which is currently making the rounds on both new and mainstream media \u2013 threw caution to the wind and deployed very uncomplimentary adjectives and intemperate language in characterising both the Judgment and Hon. Justice Ekwo, including but not limited to describing the Judgment as \u201cjungle justice\u201d and His Lordship as \u201ca hatchet man\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs if these were not enough, Engr. Umahi accused the Court of \u201cmurdering justice\u201d and also arrogated to himself the judicial powers and magisterial authority to declare the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction as null and void while unashamedly declaring his intention to disregard the Judgment in favour of another.\n\n\u201cTo put it plainly, this is impunity of the highest order and executive rascality taken too far.\u201d\n\nAkpata emphasized that the NBA has no interest in the case in question, but cannot watch politicians act in total disregard of judicial pronouncements.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA has absolutely no interest in the outcome of the case in question and will continue to stay away from partisan politics, it is inconceivable that this Association that is charged with upholding the rule of law and defending the Judiciary would sit idly by in the face of this unprovoked and totally unwarranted attack on the Judiciary,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the leadership of the NBA has been inundated with calls from a cross-section of well meaning Nigerians who are understandably outraged by the utterances of Engr. Dave Umahi and who have rightly demanded that appropriate action be taken to protect the sanctity of the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we condemn without equivocation, Engr. Umahi\u2019s unfortunate diatribe which, if it had emanated from an average litigant, would still have been regarded as shocking but coming from one who occupies the exalted office of a State Governor, is nothing short of a national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the Judgment, one would have expected Engr. Umahi to sue for calm from his supporters and to assure them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the judgment. For H.E. Engr. Umahi to instead resort to attacking and denigrating the high office of a Judge in this unprecedented manner is disgraceful, undemocratic and completely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cAs Kayode Eso, JSC of blessed memory famously noted, \u201c[t]he essence of the rule of law is that it should never operate under the rule of force or fear.\u201d We view Engr. Umahi\u2019s reaction to this Judgment as being consistent with the current penchant, on the part of those in the executive arm of government, for intimidating the Judiciary whilst taking advantage of the historical reluctance of that arm of government to rise to its own defence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the foregoing, the NBA hereby demands an immediate apology from H.E. Engr. Dave Umahi and a retraction of the comments he made against the person and Judgment of the Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court. It is also our demand that this apology and retraction be given as much media coverage as the Press Conference where the unfortunate comments were made.\u201d",
          "summary": "Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, on Wednesday, apologized to the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) over some uncomplimentary remarks he made against justice Inyang Ekwo, the Abuja High Court judge who ordered his removal as governor.\nThe NBA had in a statement by its president, Olumide Akpata earlier on Wednesday, berated Umahi for attacking the judge and demanded an apology from him.\nHe noted that he has no regrets in defecting to the ruling APC and threatened to engage in battle with the opposition party in Ebonyi State, especially for trying to distract his administration.\n\u201cI\u2019m still the governor of Ebonyi state and I\u2019m still working.\nWe said we will obey the judgement in Ebonyi state.",

So sad, we are no longer safe,\u201d the source had said.\n\nSpeaking on the killing of the vigilantes, another source told the medium that the deceased persons were ambushed after being fed wrong information regarding the location of the bandits.\n\n\u201cYesterday, after killing many people and rustling cows, the youths from Dabai, Magajiya, Ribah, Diri and Danrnagi villages confronted the bandits with their locally made guns,\u201d the source told Sahara Reporters.\n\n\u201cThey killed many of the Bandits; along the line, someone called them and gave them wrong information about the location of the bandits, so that was how they fell into the ambush of the bandits.\n\n\u201cThe location is Sakaba Local Government Area, Zuru Emirate, Kebbi state. It\u2019s a border town between Kebbi South and Niger. The town has produced many Generals.\n\n\u201cRight now, they are still operating in Zuru villages. The soldiers and the police are more afraid than the civilians.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attacks, noting that they were unacceptable.\n\nIn a statement issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, the president expressed sadness over what he described as \u201cthe brutal murder of tens of vigilante members.\u201d\n\nThe president also extended his condolences to the family members of the deceased.\n\n\u201cThis egregious level of criminality is shocking and I want to assure Nigerians that I will do all it takes to tackle this monster decisively,\u201d the President was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cMy greatest preoccupation is the threat to life posed by these murderous gangs and remorseless outlaws who have no slightest regard for the sanctity of life.\n\n\u201cWhile extending my sympathy to the families of the victims of this savagery, let me use this opportunity to also call on our security forces to be more proactive and redouble their efforts in order to frustrate the operational plans of the terrorists before they even launch attacks.\u201d",

          "text": "Dave Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State and the deputy governor, Eric Kelechi Igwe have approached the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal asking it to set-aside the judgement that sacked them from their respective offices over their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC)\n\nThe duo, through their team of lawyers led by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chukwuma Machukwu Ume, in their eight grounds of appeal, maintained that Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja, erred in law in his judgement and occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice against them.\n\nThey argued that the trial court, in ordering them to vacate their offices based on the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/920/2021, attempted to overrule a subsisting decision of the Supreme Court in AG Federation v. Atiku Abubakar & 3 ORS (2007) LCN/3799 (SC), Vanguard reported.\n\nThe duo contended that the apex court had in its decision, held that no constitutional provision prohibited a sitting President or Vice President, and invariably, the Governor or Deputy Governor, from defecting to another political party.\n\nThey maintained that the trial high court judge erred, when he held thus; \u201cI have not seen any authority which propounds that where a governor or deputy governor defects his political party on which platform he was elected into office, he cannot be sued by that political party to reclaim its mandate\u2026Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution did not envisage such a situation\u201d.\n\nThey argued that the trial court ought to have dismissed the case of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in view of the clear provision of section 308 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of Section 308 are specific, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Constitution, but subject to subsection (2) of this section, no civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted or continued against 3rd and 4th Appellants during their mandate in office as Governor and Deputy Governor respectively.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) that provides for the removal of 3rd and 4th Appellants as sitting Governor and Deputy Governor respectively of Ebonyi State for reason of defection,\u201d they argued.\n\nThe Appellants further contended that the lower court miscarried justice against them and erred in law, when it relied on Sections 68 and 109 of the Constitution, as amended, in holding that having defected from the PDP to the APC, they acted in breach of the Constitution, and must therefore, as a consequence, vacate their offices.\n\nThey noted that whereas section 68 of the Constitution, stipulated the grounds for a member of the National Assembly to vacate his seat, section 109, listed grounds for vacation of seat by a member of a State House of Assembly.\n\nIt is the position of the Appellants that there is no specific mention of Governor and Deputy Governor in the provisions of both sections 68 and 109 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\n\u201cBy relying on sections 68 and 109 of the Constitution the Honourable trial court assumed the role of the legislator and arrogated to itself the powers of amendment of the Constitution\u201d, the Appellants stated, insisting that no constitutional provision mandated a Governor or Deputy Governor to vacate office after defecting from one political party to another.\n\nMore so, Umahi and Igwe, argued that the high court erred in law and overruled the decision of the Supreme Court, when it held that ownership of votes cast during the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Ebonyi state, belonged to the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe Hon trial court relied on AMAECHI v. INEC and FALEKE v. INEC when same are no longer the law on the ownership of votes cast in an election Ngige v. Akunyile (2012) 15 NWLR Pt.1323-343 (CA)\u201d.\n\nThe Appellants quoted the trial judge to have stated thus; \u201cthe above provisions show that a political party canvasses for votes on behalf of the candidate. In other words a political party is nothing more than agent of the candidate in gathering votes to an election\u201d.\n\nThey, however, argued that the Court of Appeal had in a decided cases law in INEC vs. Action Congress (2009) 2 NWLR Pt. 1126 \u2013 524 (CA), held that, \u201cthe participation of a political party, does not exceed campaigning for the candidate\u2026.\u201d.\n\nBesides, in the ground four of their appeal, the Appellants, stated that the trial judge erred, when he held that they were deemed to have resigned from their respective offices as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, upon their defection to the APC.\n\nThey argued that section 180(1)( c) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, never contemplated or implied such resignation, but a resignation that is signed by the Appellants and tendered to the Speaker of the House of Assembly of Ebonyi State.\n\nThey said their was no evidence before the trial court that they had at any time, tendered such resignation.\n\nOn the issue of immunity clause as provided for in section 308 of the Constitution, they argued that \u201cthe Honourable trial court erred in law when it held that the provision of the Public Officers Protection Act, cannot avail the Appellants\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Appellants, \u201cthe reliefs sought by the 1st Respondent are grounded on decisions taken by the Appellants while in their respective Offices as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State\u201d, adding that they never committed any constitutional breach to deny them the benefit of the Public Officers Protection Act.\n\nFurthermore, the Appellants argued that the trial court erred in law, when it restrained them from carrying on the duties in their offices as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, on the premise that they acted in breach of sections 177(c) and 221 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cSection 221 of the Constitution is not to the effect that votes cast during the Governorship election of March 9, 2019 belonged to the 1st Respondent (PDP), but rather to the Appellants.\n\n\u201cSection 177 of the Constitution is all about qualification for a candidate to the Governorship election and has anything to do with punishment for defection\u201d, they argued.\n\nThey averred that the trial court erred in law, when it ordered the 1st Respondent (PDP) to submit to the 2nd Respondent (INEC), names of its candidates to replace the Appellants as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\nThey argued that no law gave the court the power to declare anyone that did not participate in all stages of the election, as winner of the said election.\n\n\u201cSection141 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) states that: An election tribunal or court shall not under any circumstance declare any person a winner at an election in which such a person has not fully participated in all the stages of the said election.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 285(13) of the Constitution, reinstated: An election tribunal or court shall not declare any person a winner at an election in which such a person has not fully participated in all stages of the elections\u201d, the Appellants stated.\n\nThey maintained that Justice Ekwo ought to have been persuaded by subsisting decisions of both the High Court in Ebonyi state and the Federal High Court in Zamfara State, on the issue of detection.\n\nConsequently, they prayed the appellate court to set-aside the judgement that sacked them from office, alongside with all orders that were made therein.\n\nCited as Respondents in the appeal, were the PDP, INEC and the APC.\n\nMeanwhile, no date has been fixed for hearing of the appeal, Vanguard reported.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

And that is the leaked Sex video.\n\nWhen a blackmailer leaked Savage\u2019s sex video last October it not only set the internet on fire, but also stirred up some amorous feelings in Harrysong.\n\nHarrysong was so carried away by the video that he confessed that Savage had won his heart with the tape. According to him she is a strong woman and he really admires her.\n\nHarrysong also used that opportunity to ask Savage for a collabo, adding that Savage is the perfect artiste for the song he wanted to drop.\n\nSix months on, Harrysong is singing a new song and the collabo between him and Savage is well underway. This time, not on stage or on the studio but about a sex video.\n\nLike what Savage did in 2021, Harrysong has just raised alarm that a \u2018runs\u2019 girl with whom he had had raunchy sex with is threatening to leak the sex video.\n\nDeja Vu? Of course. This reminds one of Savage\u2019s sextape, which a controversial OAP famously described as 10 powerful seconds.\n\nHarrysong made this kown via his Instagram stories on Wednesday 9 March 2022. The singer said he had paid the blackmailer a huge sum of money. Yet, she was still insisting on releasing the sextape.\n\n\u201cAny runs girl that put up an unpaid sex scandal about me any time soon, don\u2019t believe her,\u201d Harrysong write. \u201cI have paid and paid and paid just to calm down, but she\u2019s threatening..\n\n\u201cThis happened six years ago. Abi she been record me day year sef I no even know, but no shaking, at least I don tell una first.\u201d\n\nHowever, Harrysong\u2019s latest revelation has generated a lot of reactions.\n\nApart from the fact that it reminds one of Savage\u2019s video, many are also speculating it could be an attempt to pull a stunt and trend, just as Savage and Oxlade have trended in recent times.\n\nIf the \u201cruns\u201d girl eventually releases the sextape, Harrysong will join a long list of celebrities whose sex video have been trending. They include: Tiwa Savage, Oxlade, Nengi,\n\nHarrysong got married to Alexa Gopa in 2021. The couple welcomed their first child in December that same year.",

          "text": "The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Tuesday attempted to explain the worsening nationwide power supply, stating that the Generation Companies (Gencos) were not generating enough electricity to be transmitted by the company.\n\nIn a statement signed by the General Manager, Public Affairs, TCN, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, the wholly owned federal government entity, insisted that it could only transmit the power supplied by the Gencos.\n\nThe TCN notified its customers that the current load shedding being experienced nationwide was as a result of very low power generation made available by the Gencos for wheeling through the transmission grid to Distribution Companies (Discos) nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe media has been awash with reports that TCN has reduced the load allocation to distribution companies. That information is incorrect. The correct position is that TCN can only transmit the quantum of power generated by Gencos through the national grid to distribution load centres nationwide.\n\n\u201cFor clarity, TCN does not generate electricity and therefore can only transport cumulative generation from all the generation companies nationwide to distribution load centres.\n\n\u201cThe distribution companies are responsible for end-users consumption. TCN allocates power to distribution companies based on approved percentage (formula approved by NERC), of the total generation available per hour or on day-ahead nomination,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe company noted that presently, the cumulative generation nationwide was low and generation companies have attributed this to several factors including poor gas supply.\n\nOther challenges, it stressed, included low generating units of generating companies, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, all of which have caused most power generating companies to limit their generation, and sometimes not generate at all.\n\nA summary of the power generating profiles in the last two months, for instance, the statement noted, clearly showed that 14 gas-powered generating stations were either not generating at all or had limited generation at various times within the period, further depleting the quantum of power generation available for transmission into the grid on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cPower generating stations in this category include; Omotosho units 5 & 6, Olorunsogo units 3, 4 & 6, Omoku units 3 & 6, Omotosho NIPP units 3 & 4, Delta units 15, 17, and 18, Afam VI units 11 & 12, Olorunsogo NIPP unit 3, Ihovbor NIPP unit 2, Sapele Steam unit 3, Sapele NIPP unit 1, Odukpani NIPP units 1 & 3, and Okpai units 11, 12 & 18.\n\n\u201cAlso, within the same period, Jebba Hydro and Shiroro Power Generating Stations were either out or had limited generation, causing additional loss of 232MW from the grid.\n\n\u201cOther power generating plants such as Omotosho units 3&4, Olorunsogo units 1, Delta units 10 &20, Afam VI unit 13, Ihovbor NIPP units 4, Geregu NIPP units 22&23 and Odukpani NIPP units 2, 4 & 5, have also been out either on fault or for scheduled maintenance, causing a further loss of about 3,180MW from the grid,\u201d the TCN stated.\n\nThe company stated that a combination of the above scenarios had persisted and the total effect on the grid has been persistent low generation, which TCN operators have had to strive to dispatch in a way that will not jeopardise the stability of the grid.\n\n\u201cMore recently, from the 1st to 4th of March, 2022, there was generation shortfall due to water management in Shiroro and Jebba hydro with the loss of 307MW and 125MW respectively from both stations.\n\n\u201cWithin the same period, there were fault and technical problems in Egbin, causing 514MW shortfall and in Geregu causing 230MW shortfall, while reported fault at Alaoji NIPP reduced generation from the substation by 263MW.\n\n\u201cGas constraint alone in Olorunsogo gas generating plant reduced generation from the station by 104MW, in the same vein, Omotosho gas lost 102MW and Sapele NIPP lost 263MW. In Omotosho NIPP, there was generation shortfall of 233MW and in Omoku a shortfall of 112MW.\n\n\u201cTwo units in Okpai have limited generation due to technical problems causing a 204MW drop in generation and in Afam VI 511MW drop in generation.\n\n\u201cGas constraint and fault in Olorunsogo NIPP reduced generation by 240MW, Geregu NIPP by 435MW, and Ihovbor by 142MW. Also, due to gas pipeline pigging, Odukpani NIPP was shut down which caused a reduction of generation by 575MW,\u201d it added.\n\nThe TCN further reiterated that a combination of issues ranging from gas constraints, fault, and technical problems within generating plants caused persistent low generation and consequently low load allocation to distribution companies nationwide.\n\nIt pointed out that this is based on the fact that TCN can only transmit what is being generated by Gencos and presently they are all generating below capacity.\n\nTCN stated that except cumulative power generation increases considerably for it to transmit to distribution companies nationwide, TCN would be left with no choice than to continue to shed load.\n\n\u201cWe will however continue to work hard to ensure the efficient allocation of the total load generated by power generating stations into the grid, bearing in mind the need to ensure that the national grid is stable in spite of the challenges posed by insufficient load on the transmission grid,\u201d TCN said.",
          "summary": "The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Tuesday attempted to explain the worsening nationwide power supply, stating that the Generation Companies (Gencos) were not generating enough electricity to be transmitted by the company.\n\u201cThe media has been awash with reports that TCN has reduced the load allocation to distribution companies.\nThe correct position is that TCN can only transmit the quantum of power generated by Gencos through the national grid to distribution load centres nationwide.\n\u201cFor clarity, TCN does not generate electricity and therefore can only transport cumulative generation from all the generation companies nationwide to distribution load centres.\nThe company noted that presently, the cumulative generation nationwide was low and generation companies have attributed this to several factors including poor gas supply.",
